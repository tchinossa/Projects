Please segment the following transcript of a YouTube video into chapters and provide a list of chapter titles in JSON format. A chapter title should succinctly summarize the main theme or topic of each segment.
The output should be in the following JSON format:
        {
            "<chapter number>": "<chapter title>",
            "<chapter number>": "<chapter title>",
            ...
        }
You will only output the JSON object and will not output any other text.
