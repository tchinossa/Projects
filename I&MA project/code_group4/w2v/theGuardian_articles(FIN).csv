‘People are fearful of what’s to come’: Gaza civilians flee waves of Israeli strikes,2023-10-08,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/08/people-are-fearful-of-whats-to-come-gaza-civilians-flee-waves-of-israeli-strikes,"Palestinians seek refuge but electricity and gas have been cut off and medical infrastructure is on its knees
Palestinians across the besieged Gaza Strip have described their terror and confusion, as thousands fled a wave of Israeli airstrikes after Hamas’s unprecedented cross-border incursion.
“When we began asking about the situation inside the hospitals we work with, one person described it as a slaughterhouse,” said Mahmoud Shalabi of Medical Aid for Palestinians, who is overseeing support to hospitals across the Gaza Strip.
“There were bodies laying on the ground, there wasn’t enough space in the emergency department and they were struggling to deal with the influx they were seeing.
“The situation is really dire at the moment, we have been facing one of the toughest escalations as Palestinians in Gaza.”
Israel pummelled Gaza, a slim strip of land home to about 2 million people, striking it from the sea and air overnight and into the following day.
“For your safety, immediately evacuate the areas where you live,” Avichay Adraee, a military spokesperson, instructed civilians in Gaza, writing on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Many across Gaza feared there was nowhere to hide, in a 140 square mile area that has long been considered one of the most densely populated areas on Earth.
Shalabi said aid groups working inside Gaza estimated that at least 20,000 people were displaced on the first night of Israeli airstrikes. Thousands fled into Gaza City, already the most tightly populated area of the Strip, which witnessed airstrikes on tower blocks and other infrastructure.
Israeli forces claim they had selected targets linked to Hamas, while Palestinians based in Gaza accuse the Israeli military of striking civilian and residential infrastructure with tenuous connections to the militant group, which has ruled Gaza since an election in 2006.
“It’s been very worrying as you can imagine; there was a bombardment every 15 to 30 minutes throughout the night,” said Mohammed Ghalayini, an air quality scientist living in Manchester who had returned to Gaza for a rare visit to see family.
“Many people have been leaving their homes for places that are apparently safer – a friend in eastern Gaza has 80 relatives and neighbours staying with him in their block. My uncle in Khan Yonis has friends staying with him seeking refuge from their own homes which are on the eastern border [of Gaza].”
The airstrikes, drone strikes and artillery fire from ships on the Mediterranean came after Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared that his country was “at war”.
He vowed to enact an “immense price from the enemy”, after Hamas militants staged an unprecedented incursion into southern Israeli territory, capturing at least 100 Israelis and leaving at least 700 dead. The Palestinian health ministry said at least 400 were killed from Israeli airstrikes, including children, with almost 2,000 wounded.
Ghalayini said Palestinians were awed by the unprecedented nature of Hamas’s incursion into Israeli territory.
But, he added, this was not without widespread fear. “People are also very fearful of what’s to come. But Palestinians, especially in Gaza, have suffered so much over the past 15 years of blockade and attack after attack from Israel, so they feel they have nothing left to lose,” he said.
Netanyahu’s pledge to inflict pain on Gaza and target Hamas militants based in the strip follows more than a decade of repeated confrontations between Palestinian militants based in the strip and the Israeli military that has left thousands of civilians dead, as well as Israel’s 16-year blockade of the Gaza Strip.
The blockade prevents Palestinians from leaving except in exceptional circumstances, and curtails and controls the flow of goods into the area, particularly construction materials, medical supplies and even food.
After a meeting with the Israeli security cabinet, Netanyahu’s office declared they had shut off gas and electricity supplies to Gaza, and blocked goods passing through a border crossing in the north of the strip. Israel’s energy minister, Israel Katz, ordered a halt to Israeli electricity supplies, slashing Gaza’s electricity supply by 80%.
“The internet is very weak and there is no power. Even the backup generators that are now a secondary grid for those who can afford them are rationing,” said Ghalayini.
Shalabi described an unprecedented emergency situation for medical personnel across the strip, worsened by the lack of electricity as well as years of Israeli attacks that have left Gaza’s medical infrastructure on its knees.
“This morning I spoke to another doctor, a general surgeon, working in the central Gaza area. He told me they are lacking greatly medical supplies, drugs, disposables, everything needed in an emergency situation.”
“But most importantly there are not enough doctors to deal with the cases and the influx of injuries. [One] person was just starting his general surgery training, but has been managing the general surgery department for almost two days alone, while other seniors are dealing with more serious cases upstairs.”
He said his organisation immediately released its entire stock of medical resources including blood supplies, in an unusual move that exceeds their choices during previous Israeli airstrikes and attacks on Gaza.
“We are releasing everything at the moment because the situation is going to get really grim, really dire,” he said.

Hamas has taken a risk with its largest ever military blow to Israel | Yair Wallach,2023-10-08,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/08/hamas-offensive-israel-west-bank-guerrilla-movement-gaza,"The guerrilla movement that rules Gaza may be aiming to push Israel to negotiate, or positioning itself for leadership of the West Bank. Either way, there’s no knowing if it will succeed
Hamas’s attack on Israel this weekend bore an uncanny resemblance to the 1973 Yom Kippur war, which took place exactly 50 years ago this week. In both cases, careful Arab military preparation was able to catch by complete surprise a complacent Israeli government and military intelligence. Now, like then, a devastating assault was delivered on an unsuspecting morning of a Jewish holiday (Shemini Atzeret, following the festival of Sukkot).
The obvious difference is that the Yom Kippur war was launched by two substantively armed and trained militaries. Egypt and Syria, backed by the Soviet Union, attempted to recapture territories in Sinai and the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel in 1967. It was conventional warfare, in which thousands of soldiers died. Hamas, on the other hand, is a guerrilla movement which since 2007 has ruled over Gaza, a strip of land between the Mediterranean sea and Israel where 2 million people live under siege in an “open air prison”. Hamas militants crossed the border and were able to temporarily take over military installations and towns and villages, as the Israeli military appeared helpless.
Such an attack by Palestinian forces is unprecedented. But unlike in 1973, this is not an attempt to occupy and hold territory. It is essentially a large-scale deadly raid, aiming to kill, destroy, and take prisoners and hostages back to Gaza. It resembles the Palestinian Liberation Organisation’s attacks in the 1970s, only on a far larger scale. Current numbers suggest that more than 600 Israelis have been killed – the overwhelming majority of them civilians. Many families were gunned down in their homes. Thousands are injured. This was by far the deadliest day in Israeli history, surpassing the worst moments of the 2000s suicide bombings or the 1948 war. About 100 Israeli hostages are believed to be now within Gaza.
What are Hamas’s aims? In 1973 there was a clear Egyptian calculus. Israel had rebuffed Egypt’s earlier offers for a negotiated withdrawal from Sinai, and the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, believed that a limited military achievement would shift the balance of power and bring Israel to the negotiating table. Crucial, in this regard, was Egypt’s transition from the Soviet sphere of influence to US patronage. Sadat took a risk, but the geopolitical context was there to support it.
It seems that Hamas, also, is trying to force Israel into negotiations. In 2018, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar sent a note in Hebrew to Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, suggesting he take a “calculated risk” by agreeing a long-term truce. While Netanyahu agreed to some easing of pressure on Gaza, he was unwilling to accept Hamas’s long-term demands, including a large-scale prisoner swap, lifting the siege by opening the international border crossing, and establishing a port and airport in Gaza. After 16 years of siege and several catastrophic rounds of war, in which thousands of Gaza residents have been killed, Hamas may be hoping to break the deadlock. But the international climate is already inhospitable to Hamas, and an attack with so many civilian casualties and hostages will not improve this.
With Israel’s hard-right government, a negotiated settlement appears unthinkable. Yesterday, Netanyahu called on Palestinians in Gaza to “leave” – it is unclear where to – and threatened an indiscriminate wave of bombing against Hamas. Since then, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed. In a cabinet meeting, finance minister Bezalel Smotrich called for “cruel” retaliation, which suggests the dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza could well die as a result of the bombings. For the extreme right in Israel, this is also an opportunity to escalate tensions between Israel and the West Bank, the other Palestinian territory between the west bank of the River Jordan and the eastern frontier of Israel, as members of the Knesset openly speak about large-scale expulsion of Palestinians as a desired outcome.
There are loud voices within Israel – and not only within the extreme right – calling for the Israeli Defense Forces to re-occupy Gaza and remove Hamas from power. Such a campaign is not unthinkable, given the scale of Israel’s losses. But it would cost dearly in human lives and would lead to direct Israeli military rule of the Gaza Strip – an area that Israel left almost 30 years ago. On the other hand, it is all but certain that, in Israeli public opinion, pressure to secure the release of the hostages will soon mount. This would inevitably require an agreement with Hamas. But such a political resolution would be likely to involve the mass release of prisoners and further concessions in Jerusalem and the West Bank. The chances of such a deal appear dim.
Some commentators believe the attack to be an Iranian-coordinated attempt to foil the Saudi “normalisation” with Israel. Such explanations are unconvincing. The willingness of Gulf states to normalise relations with Israel may have galvanised Hamas’s willingness to act. But a major escalation in Palestine/Israel was already under way, with a dramatic rise in Palestinian casualties in the West Bank, the ethnic cleansing of several small communities, intensified settlers’ attacks, and blatant changes to the status quo at the al-Aqsa mosque/Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Many, therefore, believed a popular uprising – another intifada – was only a matter of time.
It may have been that Hamas decided that an escalation was coming and it wanted to keep the initiative in its own hands, rather than respond to a popular uprising. This attack is the largest military blow Palestinians have ever dealt to Israel. As the Palestinian National Authority, which controls the West Bank, and its 87-year-old head, Mahmoud Abbas, fade into insignificance, Hamas aims to position itself as the real Palestinian leadership for the next stage – even if that means risking a confrontation whose outcome no one can predict.

"Monday briefing: Death toll rises to more than 1,100 after weekend of conflict in Israel and Gaza",2023-10-09,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/09/monday-briefing-israel-hamas-gaza,"In today’s newsletter: Thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been wounded and killed since Saturday morning, with Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of a ‘long and difficult war’ after Hamas attack

Good morning.
At about 6:30am local time on Saturday, Hamas, the Palestinian para-military group, launched an unprecedented, surprise attack by land, air and sea, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza and launching an incursion into southern Israel taking over several Israeli towns. The offensive, which Hamas have called “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood”, took place a day after the 50th anniversary of the 1973 Yom Kippur war and caught the Israeli government and military completely off guard. It has been described as an “intelligence failure for the ages”.
Both the Israeli military and Hamas have confirmed that Israeli civilians and military personnel have been taken hostage. As of this morning, at least 700 Israelis have been killed and 100 are thought to have been taken captive. Israel’s retaliation has killed over 413 Palestinians, including 78 children in Gaza, and injured a further 2,000. That number is expected to continue to rise. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has responded quickly and unsparingly to the attack, vowing to turn “all the places that Hamas hides in” into “rubble”. Save the Children has denounced the violence, adding that the magnitude of the attacks in Israel and Gaza will have consequences that will last long after the immediate crisis.
There has been widespread international condemnation of Hamas’s offensive: Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer both said Israel has an absolute right to defend itself; the US announced it was sending military support to Israel and many other western, African and Latin American countries disavowed Hamas’s actions. Russia, China, Turkey and several Arab states issued general appeals for restraint, while Iran solely blamed Israel for the violence.
Today’s newsletter is a rundown of what has happened so far and why.
Germany | Germany’s opposition conservatives have held ground in the key states of Hesse and Bavaria in elections that highlighted discontent with Olaf Scholz’s centre-left government amid worries about economic slowdown and migration.
Labour | Rachel Reeves will announce today that a Labour government would create a powerful Covid corruption commissioner to help recoup billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money that has been lost to waste, fraud and flawed contracts during the pandemic.
Health | Mental healthcare in England has become “a national emergency”, with “overwhelmed” services unable to cope with a big post-Covid surge in people needing help, NHS bosses say.
Conservatives | Working-class people who were a key part of the coalition of voters that delivered the Conservatives’ 2019 general election win have been deserting the party in droves under Rishi Sunak’s leadership, polling by YouGov has found. Only 44% of working-class voters who voted for the Tories in 2019 say they will back the party next time.
Spain | Tens of thousands of people have joined conservative and far-right Spanish political leaders in Barcelona to protest against the Socialist party’s decision to consider an amnesty for those involved in the failed, unlawful and unilateral push for Catalan independence six years ago.
On the last day of the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, sirens were heard as far as Tel Aviv, alerting people to a barrage of rockets that were heading from the Gaza Strip. Hamas said they had launched 5,000 rockets – the IDF’s figure stood at 2,200. At the same time, Palestinian gunmen had entered Israel. Within hours, militants had infiltrated three military bases and raided the border towns of Sderot, Be’eri, and Ofakim.
Israel have said more than 100 hostages, including women and children, have been taken into Gaza by Hamas, which hugely complicates any Israeli military operation to free them, Peter Beaumont reports. The hostages include festival-goers who were attending an all-night party celebrating the Jewish holiday near the Gaza-Israel border, where 260 bodies were later found. Airlines have suspended flights into Tel Aviv, all schools across Israel and Gaza are closed and businesses have pulled their shutters down. For now, life has come to a halt.
How has Israel responded?
Prime minister Benjamin Netanyhu vowed to destroy Hamas and launched a large scale offensive, firing a wave of retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza, destroying dozens of buildings. In a televised statement he said: “Our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known. We are in a war and we will win it.”
He also told Gaza residents to “get out of there now” ahead of an Israeli military attack. However, they have no way to get out. Since 2007 Gaza has been under a full land, sea and air blockade, leading many to question where Gaza residents were expected to go as the borders into Israel and Egypt have been shut. Approximately 20,000 people have taken shelter in United Nations schools and hospitals.
Israeli warplanes continued “intense” strikes in the territory, and have targeted several buildings in the centre of Gaza City, including Palestine Tower, an 11-storey building that houses Hamas radio stations, a mosque in Khan Yunis, a school where 225 people were said to be sheltering from rocket fire and Watan Tower which services as a hub for internet providers. Most areas are without electricity as Israel has stopped supplying Gaza with power and fuel, as well as food and water. The unending shelling has made Gaza’s already dire humanitarian situation even worse, with under-equipped hospitals making appeals for blood donors.
Why did this happen?
Hamas said the attack was in response to the scenes of Israeli settlers praying inside the compound of al-Aqsa mosque in East Jerusalem and due to the treatment that Palestinians have faced over the decades. The area around the mosque is religiously significant to Jewish people and Muslims alike. Jews are not allowed to pray inside al-Aqsa compound, doing so, according to Guardian analysis, is highly provocative.
Experts and analysts however have said that the attack was not solely caused by these events – not least because this offensive would have taken months of preparation and planning. The incursion follows recent surges of conflict in Jerusalem and the Israeli-occupied West Bank: 2022 was one of the deadliest years for West Bank Palestinians with at least 146 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces. In February, there was a settler attack in Huwara so violent that the Israeli military called it a pogrom (a violent riot incited with the aim of massacring or expelling an ethnic or religious group).
There has also been a marked escalation in the number of attacks against Israelis as the political situation has deteriorated in recent years: in 2022, 29 Israelis and two foreign nationals, 27 of which were civilians, were killed in attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs, the deadliest year for Israelis since 2015.
The election of Israel’s hard right government, and the de facto annexation of the West Bank which began earlier this year, demonstrated how unstable the situation had become. A poll that was conducted towards the end of last year found that support for the peace process had plummeted to an all time low: Palestinian support for armed struggle was increasing and more and more Israelis believed that they should go to war.
The global context
In his analysis, Peter Beaumont pointed towards the US-brokered normalisation deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia as a significant factor. “The reality is that while Hamas has dressed up the attack as a response to Israeli incursions around the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, it chose to trigger this conflict – at this time and in the way it did – as a way to impose itself in that wider diplomacy,” Beaumont writes.
The attack has happened during a highly sensitive diplomatic moment that could see an alliance between the two countries – a situation that would be alarming for Iran and Hamas. Patrick Wintour’s analysis provides comprehensive insight into how this will change the picture of Middle Eastern diplomacy.
What will happen next?
Hamas leaders have called on Palestinians to join the fight and “sweep away the [Israeli] occupation”, meanwhile the Israeli military has called for mass mobilisation of its army reserves. The IDF has said that it has secured 22 locations but is continuing to sweep through others.
And there are growing concerns that the outbreak of violence could spark a broader regional conflict that could draw in Lebanon’s military group, Hezbollah. A sizeable war will cause significant civilian casualties, on both sides, and is unlikely to stabilise a region that has long simmered with unresolved tensions.

The aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel dominates the front pages on Monday. The Guardian leads with “Violence escalates as death toll surges to over 1000”. Framing a picture of an Israeli soldier killed in the attacks, the Times headlines “Stunned Israel goes to war”. The Financial Times says “Israel at war after deadly Hamas attack”.
The Telegraph reports “US sends warships and jets to help Israel”, while the i says “Fears grow for 100 hostages”. The Mail runs images of some of the hostages with the headline “Pawns of merciless terrorists”.
Elsewhere, the Mirror has an interview with Shadow Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, under the headline “Put your trust in me”. Finally, the Sun reports on a feud between former Britain’s Got Talent judges with “Cowell: David’s a wally”.
From Blair to Starmer: Labour’s path to power – part 1
In 1996, Labour was way ahead in the opinion polls with their sights set on an election campaign expected the following year. The party had been out of power for 17 years and faced a Conservative party beset by scandals, bereft of ideas and heading for oblivion. The party was led by Tony Blair, a former lawyer who had taken on the left of his party and won internal policy battles with a pitch for the centre ground. The parallels with the present day could barely be clearer.
In the first of two parts looking back at that period, political correspondent Kiran Stacey hears from those who were around Tony Blair at the time: Labour’s campaign strategist Peter Mandelson, the director of communications, Alastair Campbell, the policy chief, David Miliband, the MP Harriet Harman and the political adviser Liam Byrne.

A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad
It’s been estimated that emissions from livestock (mostly cows) account for about 14% of global climate emissions, that’s a third of human-caused methane emissions. That’s part of the reason there’s been such a focus on cutting meat consumption, which has led Conservative politicians to rail against so-called “meat bans”.
But research from Sweden offers some hope for a solution. A report from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency into feeds that can reduce methane emissions says development in the field has been “rapid in recent years” and there are “a number of new interesting additives with higher potential”. Among the additives cited in the report were the seaweed red algae, which according to manufacturers can reduce the methane emissions of animals by up to 90%. It’s still in the early stage of research, but could offer an alternative to trying to persuade millions to give up their burger habit.

Israel declares siege of Gaza as Hamas threatens to start killing hostages,2023-10-09,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/09/israel-declares-siege-on-gaza-as-hamas-claims-israeli-strikes-killed-captives,"Hamas says Israeli strikes have killed some captives and it will kill another if bombing without warning continues
Israel has declared a “complete siege” of Gaza, cutting off water, food and power supplies, as Hamas militants threatened to start killing Israeli civilian hostages if the bombing of civilian areas in the enclave continued without prior warning.
Palestinian militants abducted more than 100 people during a surprise multi-front attack in which they killed more than 700 – making Saturday the deadliest day in Israel’s history. Israeli media said on Monday the death toll had climbed to 900.
In response to the attack, Israel has launched strikes from the air and sea, which medics said had killed more than 680 Palestinians in Gaza, an area home to 2.3 million people with nowhere to flee.
Separately, about 120 miles to the north of Gaza, Israel said its forces had fought off gunmen crossing from Lebanon – an incident that raises the spectre of a second front in the unfolding war.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called on the political opposition to join a government of national unity and said the offensive had “only started”.
In a televised address late on Monday, Netanyahu pledged to “eliminate terrorists” still present in Israel and said: “What we will do to our enemies in the coming days will reverberate with them for generations.”
Israel formally declared war on Sunday and called up 300,000 reservists for duty, signalling a possible ground assault into Gaza – a move that in the past has always brought further bloodshed. However, Israeli forces face the unprecedented task of fighting an urban war while dozens of hostages are likely to be hidden in tunnels and basements across the Gaza Strip.
Abu Ubaida, a spokesperson for the armed wing of Hamas, claimed on Monday that Israeli bombardment had already killed “four of the enemy’s captives and their captors”.
Later, he said Hamas would kill an Israeli civilian captive in return for any new Israeli bombing of civilian homes “without prior warning”.
In an audio statement, Ubaida said there had been intense strikes by Israel on civilian areas in Gaza in which apartments were destroyed over people’s heads.
“We have decided to put an end to this and as of now, and we declare that any targeting of our people in their homes without prior warning will be regrettably faced with the execution of one of the hostages of civilians we are holding,” he said.
In previous rounds of fighting, Israel has sometimes warned civilians in Gaza of impending attacks on residential buildings. It has done this either by text messages or phone calls to Palestinians. It has also fired low-yield munition warning strikes, which locals call “roof knocks”, on targets before bombing them. These measures have given civilians several minutes to clear the structure before it is destroyed, although in practice in built-up areas, many civilians have still been killed.
In a joint statement on Monday night, Joe Biden, the US president; Rishi Sunak, the UK prime miniser; Emmanuel Macron, the French president; the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz; and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, released a joint statement promising their “steadfast and united support to the state of Israel, and our unequivocal condemnation of Hamas and its appalling acts of terrorism”.
They said: “We make clear that the terrorist actions of Hamas have no justification, no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned. There is never any justification for terrorism.
Israeli media reported on Monday that in the current round of fighting, the military was not always warning civilians of the attacks. This was not confirmed by the military.
Qatar’s foreign ministry said it was in mediation talks with Hamas and Israeli officials, including over a possible prisoner swap, and a state-run newspaper in Egypt reported that the Egyptian government was negotiating a release of female detainees held by both sides. Neither Israel nor Hamas confirmed they were talking.
The captives are known to include civilians including women, children and older adults – mostly Israelis but also people of other nationalities – and soldiers. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, has said dozens of American citizens, largely dual nationals, are among those held captive.
Hamas’s attack, in which assailants rampaged through the heavily fortified frontier and shot unarmed civilians as they encountered them, has left the Israeli military scrambling to regain control of its territory. Palestinian militants have continued to fire hundreds of rockets deep into Israel.
It was only on Monday morning that Israel’s army declared its forces were in control of towns and villages in its southern territory, although a spokesperson acknowledged that militants could still be hiding inside Israel.
“We are in control of the communities,” said the chief military spokesperson, R Adm Daniel Hagari, adding that there still might be “terrorists” in the area.
As Israeli troops were massing in the south, Israel said it had thwarted an infiltration attempt by gunmen operating out of Lebanon to the north. The armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which operates out of Gaza and Lebanon, claimed responsibility for the attack.
In a sign of how easily the conflict could spiral out of control, Israel responded to the infiltration attempt by carrying out helicopter strikes on Lebanese territory, which were reported to have killed a member of the powerful Hezbollah group. If Hezbollah, which has fought conflicts with Israel to devastating effect, were to further enter the war, Israel could be fighting on two fronts.
The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said he had instructed the military to put Gaza under siege, a word rarely uttered in public by Israeli officials.
“I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel, everything is closed,” Gallant said. “We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.”
It was not immediately clear if Egypt, which shares a southern border with Gaza, would keep its land crossing open. Inhabitants of Gaza require permission to enter Egypt, which can sometimes take days or even weeks to be approved.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, condemned the Hamas attacks as “acts of terror” and said he was “deeply distressed” by the Israeli government’s plan for a “complete siege”.
“The humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities. Now it will only deteriorate exponentially,” Guterres said.
“This most recent violence does not come in a vacuum. The reality is that it grows out of a longstanding conflict, with a 56-year long occupation and no political end in sight. While I recognise Israel’s legitimate security concerns, I also remind Israel that military operations must be conducted in strict accordance with international humanitarian law.”
Guterres began his speech by expressing “utter condemnation of the abhorrent attacks by Hamas and others against Israeli towns and villages in the Gaza periphery”.
He said: “I recognise the legitimate grievances of the Palestinian people. But nothing can justify these acts of terror and the killing, maiming and abduction of civilians.”
Saturday’s attack caught Israel’s vaunted military and intelligence apparatus off guard, bringing gun battles to Israel’s streets for the first time in decades and shaking the country to its core. Once across the frontier, militants moved several miles into Israel and killed civilians indiscriminately.
Zaka, an Israeli rescue service, said it had retrieved at least 260 bodies from the site of the Supernova music festival near the kibbutz of Re’im, close to the Israel-Gaza border. Images and video from the site showed festivalgoers running across open fields as Hamas gunmen targeted them.
Early on Monday, Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson, said the situation in Israel was dire. “It is by far the worst day in Israeli history. Never before have so many Israelis been killed by one single thing on one day.”
Conricus said a significant number of Israeli civilians and military personnel had been taken hostage and moved into Gaza. Later, the Israeli foreign minister, Eli Cohen, confirmed more than 100 people had been taken captive by Hamas.
Gaza has been sealed off by a 16-year Israeli blockade after the election of Hamas in 2006, as well as by routine closures on the southern border with Egypt.
Conricus said the IDF response would make sure that at the end of the war “Hamas will not be able to govern the Gaza Strip”.
Speaking to troops near the frontier with Gaza, the IDF chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said that after “a rough start, we are shaping the line of engagement”.
He said: “We will finish purging the area so that we do not have terrorists here, and at the same time we are already on the offensive. It started badly, and will end very badly on the other side.”

Spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus posted an update on the IDF’s response online. He said “almost 48 hours into the fighting… the situation in Israel is a dire one” and the death toll will rise.
Up to 100 Israeli hostages, including women and children, may have been taken into Gaza by Hamas, hugely complicating any Israeli military operation to free them. The whereabouts and fate of the captives has become one of the most pressing issues for military planners.
Numerous members of the UN security council denounced Hamas on Sunday but the United States regretted the lack of unanimity. At an emergency session, the United States and Israel urged strong condemnation of the Palestinian Islamists. “There are a good number of countries that condemned the Hamas attacks. They’re obviously not all,” senior US diplomat Robert Wood told reporters after the closed-door session. “You could probably figure out one of them without me saying anything,” said Wood, in a clear allusion to Russia.
Iran helped Hamas plan its surprise attacks against Israel over the weekend, according to senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah who spoke to the Wall Street Journal. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken has however said that Washington had not seen any evidence that Iran was behind the attack and Iran has denied any involvement in the attack. But Tehran has defended Hamas’s assault as a “wholly legitimate defence”.
An Israeli airstrike has killed 19 members of a Palestinian family in a Gaza refugee camp, according to the Associated Press.
The permanent observer mission of the state of Palestine to the UN has issued a response on Sunday to the Israel-Hamas war, saying that “these developments did not occur in a vacuum”. “They are preceded by the killing this year of hundreds of Palestinians … and preceded by decades of Israel’s unrelenting military raids on Palestinian villages, towns, cities and refugee camps,” it said.
US president Joe Biden told the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday that “additional assistance for the Israeli Defense Forces is now on its way to Israel with more to follow over the coming days.” After the call between the two leaders, the White House released a statement, saying: “The President … pledged his full support for the Government and people of Israel in the face of an unprecedented and appalling assault by Hamas terrorists.”
More airlines have suspended flights into Tel Aviv following Hamas’s attacks on Israel over the weekend. Those airlines include Delta, American Airlines, United and Air France.
The UN’s World Food Programme has called on the establishment of humanitarian corridors to deliver food supplies into Gaza following Israeli airstrikes in response to Hamas’s attacks. “As the conflict intensifies, civilians, including vulnerable children and families, face mounting challenges in accessing essential food supplies,” the WFP said.
Agence France-Presse reports from Sderot, Israel
Israeli troops fought to regain control of the desert around the Gaza Strip and evacuate people from the embattled border area on Monday, as the death toll from the war with Hamas surged above 1,100 by the third day of clashes.
Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israel on Sunday to prepare for a “long and difficult” conflict a day after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise assault from Gaza, firing a barrage of rockets and sending a wave of fighters who gunned down civilians and took at least 100 hostages.
More than 700 Israelis have been killed since Hamas launched its large-scale attack, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday - the country’s worst losses since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.
Gaza officials reported at least 413 deaths in the impoverished and blockaded enclave of 2.3 million people, which was hammered by Israeli air strikes on 800 targets ahead of what many feared may be a looming ground invasion.
Tens of thousands of Israeli forces were deployed to battle holdout Hamas fighters in the south, where the bodies of civilians had been found strewn on roads and in town centres.
“The enemy is still on the ground,” military spokesman Daniel Hagari said as a second night fell after the massive opening attack.
US president Joe Biden ordered “additional support for Israel in the face of this unprecedented terrorist assault by Hamas”.
US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington “will be rapidly providing the Israel Defense Forces with additional equipment and resources, including munitions”.
Austin directed the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier and group of warships to the eastern Mediterranean, and said that Washington was augmenting fighter aircraft squadrons in the region.
Hamas has said the US aid amounted to “aggression” against Palestinians.
The conflict has had global impact, with several other countries reporting nationals killed, abducted or missing, among them Brazil, Britain, France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Nepal, Thailand and Ukraine.
A US National Security Council spokesperson confirmed that “several” Americans had been killed in the surprise attack, but did not provide further details.
China’s ministry of foreign affairs has reiterated its calls for a two-state solution to address the root causes of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
A spokesperson said:
China is deeply concerned over the current escalation of tensions and violence between Palestine and Israel. We call on relevant parties to remain calm, exercise restraint and immediately end the hostilities to protect civilians and avoid further deterioration of the situation.
The recurrence of the conflict shows once again that the protracted standstill of the peace process cannot go on. The fundamental way out of the conflict lies in implementing the two-state solution and establishing an independent State of Palestine.
The international community needs to act with greater urgency, step up input into the Palestine question, facilitate the early resumption of peace talks between Palestine and Israel, and find a way to bring about enduring peace. China will continue to work relentlessly with the international community towards that end.
Iran’s mission to the United Nations said on Sunday that Tehran was not involved in one of the bloodiest attacks in Israel’s history when Islamist group Hamas killed 700 Israelis and abducted dozens more.
“The resolute measures taken by Palestine constitute a wholly legitimate defence against seven decades of oppressive occupation and heinous crimes committed by the illegitimate Zionist regime,” Iran’s UN mission said in statement.
Iran has made no secret of its backing for Hamas, funding and arming the group and another Palestinian militant organisation Islamic Jihad.
The Hamas assault on Saturday, the biggest incursion into Israel in decades, coincided with US-backed moves to push Saudi Arabia towards normalising ties with Israel in return for a defence deal between Washington and Riyadh, a move that would slam the brakes on the kingdom’s rapprochement with Tehran.
“We emphatically stand in unflinching support of Palestine; however, we are not involved in Palestine’s response, as it is taken solely by Palestine itself,” Iran’s UN mission said.
Hamas fighters’ rampage through Israeli towns on Saturday was the deadliest such incursion since Egypt and Syria’s attacks in the Yom Kippur war 50 years ago and has threatened to ignite another conflagration in the long-running conflict.
Iran’s UN mission said the “success” of the Hamas operation was because it was a surprise, which makes it the “biggest failure” of Israel’s security organisations.
“They are attempting to justify their failure and attribute it to Iran’s intelligence power and operational planning,” Iran’s UN mission said.
In response to the Hamas attacks, Israeli air strikes have hit housing blocks, tunnels, a mosque and homes of Hamas officials in Gaza, killing more than 400 people, including 20 children.
“They (Israel) find it very difficult to accept that in the intelligence community, it is being narrated that they were defeated by a Palestinian group,” said Iran’s UN mission.
At least two Ukrainians have been killed in the conflict in Israel and more remain stranded in the country, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his daily address on Sunday.
Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s embassy was working with Israeli authorities “to find out the details about Ukrainians who found themselves in the areas of hostilities and shelling”.
The Embassy of Ukraine in Israel, all our diplomats who are in charge of this region, together with the intelligence service, are working around the clock to help all our people who need help. The Embassy has already received more than a hundred appeals from our citizens
Zelenskiy has spoken by phone with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
US citizens are among civilians taken hostage by Hamas during an assault on Israel launched from Gaza, Israel’s minister for strategic affairs Ron Dermer, has said.
Speaking on CNN, Dermer said he believed Hamas had taken “scores of hostages” from Israeli territory into Gaza.
“I can tell you there’s also American hostages as part of that number as well.”
Spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus posted an update on the IDF’s response online. He said “almost 48 hours into the fighting… the situation in Israel is a dire one”.
He said there was “still fighting going on in southern Israel, our troops are still fighting”.
Conricus said the IDF estimated upwards of 1000 Hamas militants entered Israeli territory in the attack on Saturday. He said 700 Israelis had been killed - civilians and military personnel - and more than 2100 wounded. With a “high number of critically wounded people”, more deaths are expected, he said.
“It is by far the worst day in Israeli history. Never before have so many Isarelis been killed by one single thing on one day.”
Drawing a US analogy, he said the weekend’s attack, for Israel, “could be a 9/11 and a Pearl Harbour wrapped into one”.
Conricus said a significant number of Israeli civilians and military personnel had been taken hostage and moved into Gaza. He did not specify a figure, but said “many many Israelis [have been] forcefully taken from Israel”.
He said the IDF military response had two primary objectives in its response to the Hamas attack.
“At the end of this war, Hamas will no longer have any military capabilities to threaten Israeli civilians. .. Hamas will not be able to govern the Gaza Strip.”
If you don't know anything about what the Israeli occupation of Palestine looks like in 2023, and even if you do, this is 10 minutes of pure, perfect clarity from @MustafaBarghou1 https://t.co/j0dUvAl1pH
Countries around the world have reacted to a wave of attacks by land, sea and air carried out by Palestinian armed group Hamas that Israel says has claimed more than 700 lives.
The statements by world leaders ranged from outright condemnation of the attacks and strong support for Israel from Western nations, to support for Hamas from some Middle Eastern countries.
Many have called for a de-escalation of the conflict, after Israel launched air strikes and other military operations targeting Gaza that Palestinian authorities say killed at least 413 people.
Here is a round-up of the reactions:
United States
President Joe Biden said US support for Israel was “rock solid and unwavering”.
On Sunday, he ordered US ships and warplanes to move closer to Israel.
Washington also promised to provide munitions and equipment to Israel, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Sunday.
“Several US citizens” were among those killed in Hamas’s surprise attack, according to a US National Security Council spokesperson.
Iran
President Ebrahim Raisi said on Sunday that Iran supported the Palestinians’ right to self-defence and warned Israel must be held accountable for endangering the region.
A senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had already backed the attack Saturday, calling it a “proud operation”.
Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry called for “an immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, protection of civilians, and self-control”.
United Nations
The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting Sunday, a day after secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged diplomatic efforts in the Middle East to prevent wider conflict.
Diplomats said the Security Council did not consider any joint statement, let alone a binding resolution, with members led by Russia hoping for a broader focus than condemning Hamas.
European Union
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen had already condemned the attack by Hamas on Saturday.
On Sunday, she posted on X, formerly Twitter: “The full scale of the brutality of the Hamas terror attack leaves us breathless.
“Defenceless people, brutally murdered in cold blood on the streets. We stand strong with Israel and its people. Today the EU and Israeli flags fly side by side.”
The full scale of the brutality of the Hamas terror attack leaves us breathless.Defenseless people, brutally murdered in cold blood on the streets. We stand strong with Israel and its people.Today the EU and Israeli flags fly side by side. pic.twitter.com/fHJYVOM19k
China
“China is deeply concerned about the current escalation of tension and violence between Palestine and Israel,” said a foreign ministry statement Sunday.
Beijing “calls on all parties concerned to remain calm and exercise restraint, cease fire immediately, protect civilians and prevent further deterioration of the situation”, it added.
Russia
Russia’s foreign ministry called for an “immediate ceasefire” and negotiations towards “a comprehensive, lasting and long-awaited peace,” spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
Ukraine
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is fending off a Russian invasion, said Sunday he had spoken with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to offer condolences “for the numerous casualties caused by the terrorist attack”.
He said on Saturday that Israel had an “indisputable” right to defend itself, adding that “terror is always a crime”.
South Africa
The ruling African National Congress issued a statement Sunday saying: “It can no longer be disputed that Apartheid South Africa’s history is occupied Palestine’s reality.
“As a result, the decision by Palestinians to respond to the brutality of the settler Israeli apartheid regime is unsurprising.”
The statement added that it was clear that “the degenerating security situation is directly linked to the unlawful Israeli occupation”.
France
French foreign minister Catherine Colonna held talks by telephone with several of her counterparts in the Middle East in a bid to “prevent the conflict degenerating” by spreading to other parts of the region, a ministry statement Sunday.
France’s foreign ministry also called for the immediate release of the hostages taken by Hamas.
Germany
German chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday Israel has the right to defend itself against “barbaric attacks” and “to protect its citizens and to pursue the attackers.”
He called Netanyahu to tell him Germany stands “firmly and unwaveringly by Israel’s side”.
German-Israeli nationals are among the hostages taken by Hamas, a foreign ministry source confirmed.
United Kingdom
British prime minister Rishi Sunak said Sunday he had assured Netanyahu of London’s “steadfast support”.
“We will do everything that we can to help. Terrorism will not prevail,” he added in a statement.
Turkey
Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday urged Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas “to support peace” and refrain from harming civilians.
“There is no good in (attacking) civilians,” Erdogan said. “We are ready to do everything to reduce the tensions.”
Italy
Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni has called Netanyahu to reaffirm “Rome’s full solidarity” following the Hamas offensive.
“Italy stands by the Israeli people at this difficult time,” said a government statement.
Japan
Japan “strongly condemns” the attacks, foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa said Sunday, as well as the taking of hostages by Hamas.
“Meanwhile, we are seriously concerned about the large number of casualties in the Gaza Strip as a result of attacks by the Israel Defence Forces,” her statement continued, calling for restraint.
Vatican City
Pope Francis on Sunday said that “terrorism and war do not lead to any resolutions, but only to the death and suffering of so many innocent people.
“War is a defeat! Every war is a defeat! Let us pray that there be peace in Israel and in Palestine.”
India
Prime minister Narendra Modi said India stood “in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour”.
“Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel,” Modi said.
Venezuela
Venezuela’s government expressed its “deep concern” over the clashes.
In a statement on X, it said the fighting was “the result of the impossibility of the Palestinian people to find in multilateral international legality a space to assert their historic rights”.
Yemen
In Yemen, Huthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa expressed their support for “the heroic jihadist operation”.
In a statement on the website of the Huthi-controlled SABA news agency, the Iran-aligned militant group said the attack “revealed the weakness, fragility and impotence” of Israel.
AFP
Agence France-Presse reports…
Major airlines cancelled dozens of flights to Tel Aviv this weekend after the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack against Israel.
American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair are among those pulling flights to Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport.
However, airport authorities did not stop commercial air links with Israel’s second international airport at Eilat, a tourist destination on the Red Sea.
And Israeli flag carrier El Al said Sunday that it was maintaining its Tel Aviv flights for now, though some flights operated by foreign partners had been cancelled.
El Al said it was operating “in accordance with the instructions of the Israeli security forces”, with all flights now departing only from Terminal Three at Ben Gurion.
Like most other airlines, it said clients could change their tickets without charge.
In Athens, the foreign ministry said it was working to repatriate 149 Greek tourists from Israel, and 81 of them were due to arrive back late Sunday on an El Al flight.
After Saturday saw a list of major carriers cancelling flights, Spain’s AENA airports operator told AFP four of nine flights scheduled to Tel Aviv on Sunday had been cancelled, two from Madrid and two from Barcelona.
Another nine flights, from Tel Aviv to airports in Spain, have so far been unaffected, the operator said.
Spain’s Air Europa said it had cancelled its two flights scheduled between Madrid and Tel Aviv, while Iberia Express, the low-cost arm of national carrier Iberia, went ahead with a Madrid-Tel Aviv flight after suspending two on Saturday.
Vueling, the Barcelona-based low-cost airline, said given the situation in Israel, “flights to/from Tel Aviv are affected and experiencing delays”.
A spokesman for Germany’s Lufthansa on Saturday cited “the current security situation” to say it was cancelling all flights to and from Tel Aviv “up until and including Monday”.
Air France said it had halted Tel Aviv flights “until further notice”, and the Air France-KLM group’s low-cost carrier Transavia said it was cancelling all flights from Paris and Lyon to Tel Aviv up to and including Monday.
Italy’s flag-carrier ITA airways cancelled its flight until Sunday morning at the earliest “to protect the safety of passengers and crew”, while Polish carrier LOT scrapped its flights from the Polish capital on Saturday.
US-based United Airlines told AFP its Tel Aviv flights “will remain suspended until conditions allow them to resume.”
It said it had “operated two scheduled flights out of Tel Aviv late Saturday and early Sunday and accommodated our customers, crews and employee travellers who were at the airport.”
Other airlines suspending flights included Aegean, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Wizz Air and Air Canada.

"Israel identifies most of the hostages abducted by Hamas, reports suggest",2023-10-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/israel-identifies-most-of-the-hostages-abducted-by-hamas-reports-suggest,"About 100 families to be told that their loved ones are in Gaza as Israel plans a possible ground offensive
Israel is believed to have identified most of the hostages abducted by the militant group Hamas and has started notifying their families.
Officers from the Israel Defence Forces were to tell about 100 families on Tuesday that their loved ones were in Gaza, the Times of Israel reported, citing Israeli army radio.
For some, the notifications will merely confirm what they already know from recognising relatives in harrowing footage of people – some bleeding and visibly terrified – being dragged into the Palestinian enclave after Hamas’s lightning attacks last weekend. The videos were filmed by Hamas and shared on social media and through WhatsApp groups.
Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the total number of hostages seized was between 100 and 150.
The hostages’ fate is unclear. Israeli airstrikes have pounded Gaza in intensive waves every four hours, reducing apartment blocks to rubble. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 770 Palestinians had died and 4,000 were wounded. On Monday Hamas said airstrikes had killed four hostages and their captors.
The Qassam brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, have threatened to execute one hostage for each new Israeli airstrike on civilian targets without warning.
Israel said on Monday it would cut off electricity, food, fuel and water in a “complete siege” of the tightly packed strip of 2.3 million people. Authorities said more than 1,000 Israelis died in the Hamas attacks.
Uncertainty over the hostages is an acute dilemma for the Israeli military as it plans a possible ground offensive in Gaza and is an agonising ordeal for the hostages’ relatives.
Yossi Sneider told the BBC of his horror after seeing a picture of his cousin Shiri Bib and her two children, four-year-old Ariel and nine-month-old Kfir, surrounded by militants. Later in a video he said he saw Bib crying and holding her children.
Bib, a kindergarten teacher who had been living in a kibbutz, was gentle and kind, said Sneider. “She doesn’t deserve this experience; nobody does. I have no words to describe this.” Bib’s parents, Margit and Yossi Silverman, and her husband, Yarden, were also missing, he said. Margit has Parkinson’s and diabetes.
Uncertainty is tormenting relatives. Jennifer Damti said she had not slept since learning that her daughter Kim Damti, 22, an Irish-Israeli citizen who attended the Supernova festival, was missing. “All I can think about is where she is, if she’s suffering, if she’s still alive, I just want her back,” Damti told ABC News.
Qatar is reportedly attempting to broker an agreement for Hamas to release Israeli women and children in exchange for Israel freeing 36 Palestinian women and children from Israeli prisons.
Several foreign nationals are feared to have been taken hostage, including at least two Mexicans, three Brazilians and an unknown number of US citizens.
The Israeli military said it had set up a situation room to collate and track information about the hostages, who include soldiers. Police and the army’s Home Front Command have also established a situation room to identify those killed in Hamas attacks. People with missing relatives queued outside a police station to supply DNA samples and other means to facilitate identification, the Times of Israel reported.

"More than 900 dead in Gaza since Saturday as shelling hits school, hospitals and homes",2023-10-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/830-dead-in-gaza-since-saturday-as-shelling-hits-school-hospitals-and-homes,"‘There is no safe place in Gaza right now’ say humanitarian workers, as Israel bombs sole border crossing with Egypt, preventing refugees’ escape
Frightened residents of Gaza have described bombardments striking residential buildings, hospitals and schools across the enclave amid growing concern over destruction of civilian infrastructure as Israel pledges to enforce a full siege.
Palestinian health officials said more than 900 people have been killed, with 4,250 wounded since Saturday.
Nidal Hamdouna, a humanitarian worker with Norwegian-Danish organisation Church Aid, said: “I believe this is the most serious escalation I will face. I was born here in Gaza, I witnessed the previous escalations.
“The situation we are facing involves intensive airstrikes and shelling targeting different locations across the Gaza Strip, including my neighbourhood,” he said, speaking from the northern edge of Gaza City. “The issue is that there is no safe place to go to in Gaza right now.”
“I witnessed the wars of 2008, 2014 and 2021, but this is something unique in terms of the intensity … entire families have been killed. The concern is to what extent civilians are protected, but also how to find a safe place, even though there is no safe place to go to.”
Gaza’s sole border crossing with Egypt, the only entry point not controlled by Israel, was hit by an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday for the third time in 24 hours, an Egyptian NGO said.
The UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) has said that more than 200,000 people have been displaced in Gaza, with that number expected to rise. Airstrikes levelled 790 housing units, it said, and severely damaged 5,330.
The rising number of wounded risks overwhelming what remains of Gaza’s fragile healthcare system after a 16-year blockade from the Israeli authorities curtailing inflows of people, fuel, construction materials and food.
Mahmoud Shalabi of the aid organisation Medical Aid for Palestinians said: “Beit Hanoun hospital in the north of Gaza has been out of service due to the collateral damage it received from bombardments around it. Also, roads around it were destroyed so now it’s not possible to access it.”
Shalabi also described damage to Gaza’s largest hospital, Al Shifa in Gaza city, which has long acted as the central point of care for the enclave’s residents, particularly during moments of crisis.
“The neonatal unit at Shifa hospital, the central trauma hospital and the largest in Gaza, was partly damaged due to bombardments around the facility,” he said.
“The roads around Al Shifa have been severely impacted, which is limiting movement to it, while all hospitals are suffering greatly from the lack of supplies and personnel,” he said. “Yesterday, the ministry of health called for all nurses in Gaza to begin volunteer work in the nearest hospital.”
UN secretary general António Guterres expressed his concern at increasing reports that Israeli airstrikes and shelling had hit civilian infrastructure. “While I recognise Israel’s legitimate security concerns, I also remind Israel that military operations must be conducted in strict accordance with international humanitarian law,” he said.
“Civilians must be respected and protected at all times. Civilian infrastructure must never be a target.”
Guterres previously said he was “deeply distressed” by Israeli pledges to enforce a “complete siege” of Gaza. Earlier this week, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said that “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed to enter the densely populated territory after an unprecedented incursion by Hamas militants into Israel, leaving more than 1,000 dead – the greatest loss of life from a militant attack in Israel’s history.
Fighters from Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad also took at least 130 Israelis hostage, with a Hamas spokesperson declaring that the group would begin killing captives if the Israeli military struck civilian homes in Gaza “without prior warning”.
IDF spokesperson Lt Col Richard Hecht advised Palestinians to “get out” and escape the airstrikes through the southern border crossing with Egypt, before his office issued a clarifying statement that the crossing is now closed.
“This time it really is a catastrophe for the entire Gaza population – more than 2 million people are under fire and affected by this war and the escalation because of a full siege,” said Hamdouna, predicting a sharp rise in the number of internally displaced people, despite a lack of shelter.
“There is real concern about the availability of water. I have water for one day, maximum – I don’t know if I can get more. I don’t know about the availability of food. But there are also restrictions on movement, whether I can safely get to the supermarket, to what extent trucks can reach my home to carry drinking water. All these things made the situation far worse, in addition to these intensive airstrikes targeting everything,” he said.
“I believe this is a collective punishment for the entire Gaza population. Civilians are not safe, they can’t access to their basic needs – water, food. The health sector is deteriorating under the number of injured people,” he said.
“Every aspect of our lives has been affected. Electricity is a major concern, we have at most three hours per day now and the electricity plant in Gaza announced that in a few days it will have no power at all. This will impact access to sanitation, but also food security, in addition to more problems with communications.”
He added: “I can’t even open my laptop to take notes – I’m trying to conserve electricity at home to charge my phone. As a humanitarian worker I can’t even work from my home in response to the crisis.”
The Israeli military said that it had called up 300,000 reservists and begun installing what a spokesperson described as “an iron wall” of tanks and helicopters around the Gaza border ahead of an expected large-scale ground invasion of the besieged enclave.
“It is terrifying,” said Hamdouna. “The concern is what comes next – a further catastrophe in the coming few days.”

"Israeli troops mass on Gaza border as death toll from Hamas attack passes 1,000",2023-10-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/israeli-troops-mass-on-gaza-border-as-death-toll-from-hamas-attack-passes-1000,"Hundreds of thousands of reservists head for units amid mounting expectation of large-scale ground invasion
A massive Israeli military buildup was continuing along Gaza’s border on Tuesday, as the country’s military confirmed the death toll from Saturday’s Hamas attack – the deadliest militant assault in its history – had passed 1,000 and wave after wave of airstrikes hit the territory.
Amid mounting expectations that Israel would launch a ground invasion of Gaza within days, Israeli soldiers were still collecting bodies of the dead four days after Hamas rampaged through southern Israeli towns in the deadliest terrorist attack in the country’s history.
The Israeli military said it had mostly secured its border with Gaza after a night of intensified airstrikes across the enclave that destroyed infrastructure and displaced thousands of people. The Gaza health authority has put the death toll in the enclave at 900 since Saturday.
In a sign of the rapidly escalating crisis, a salvo of rockets from Hezbollah-controlled southern Lebanon was fired at northern Israel, leading Israeli forces to return fire in the third consecutive day of violence along the Lebanese-Israeli border. The Israeli military also shelled Syria from the Golan Heights after mortar rounds were fired into the territory. Two Palestinians were shot dead by police in East Jerusalem.
Evidence of the scale of Saturday’s horror has continued to emerge, including in the southern kibbutz of Be’eri, where more than 100 bodies have been retrieved, about 10% of the community’s population.
In Kfar Aza kibbutz, bodies of Israeli residents and Hamas militants lay on the ground beside strewn furniture and torched cars as Israeli soldiers went from house to house to take away the dead.
“You see the babies, the mothers, the fathers, in their bedrooms … It’s not a war, it’s not a battlefield. It’s a massacre,” said Israeli Maj Gen Itai Veruv, escorting journalists at the scene. “It’s something that we used to imagine from our grandfathers, grandmothers in the pogrom in Europe and other places.”
In Washington, Joe Biden condemned Hamas, denouncing its attack as an “act of sheer evil” and expressing his horror at “sickening” reports of torture inflicted on innocent civilians.
“Our hearts may be broken but our resolve is clear,” the US president said. He added: “Let there be no doubt. The United States has Israel’s back. We’ll make sure the Jewish and democratic state of Israel can defend itself today, tomorrow as we always have.”
As hundreds of Israeli tanks and other military vehicles converged on muster points around Gaza, hundreds of thousands of reservists were travelling to join their units, with an Israeli military spokesperson saying its forces were installing “an iron wall” along the border of the besieged coastal enclave.
The huge scale of the mobilisation suggests Israel is preparing for a far more substantial military attack against Hamas in Gaza than in the previous rounds of fighting, which claimed thousands of Palestinian lives.
Mairav Zonszein of the International Crisis Group said: “This is clearly preparation for a major ground invasion. I don’t think there’s any basis in understanding how that will either bring back the captives or get rid of Hamas.”
About 150 people are believed to be being held captive by militants in Gaza, with Hamas threatening to start executing its hostages if Israel carried out airstrikes without warning.
The country’s military said on Tuesday that it had recovered the bodies of more than 1,500 Hamas fighters inside Israel, giving the clearest indication yet of the scale of the weekend’s assault.
A Guardian journalist who drove down Israel’s 234 highway to Re’im, close to the border with Gaza, described hearing rocket fire and seeing the bodies of five Hamas militants, who had been stripped to check for explosives, lying in the open.
Israeli warplanes hammered the Gaza Strip neighbourhood on Tuesday, reducing buildings to rubble as people scrambled to find safety. It followed what the military said were hundreds of targets struck overnight in the wealthy al-Rimal district of Gaza City, home to ministries of the Hamas-run government, as well as universities, media organisations and the offices of aid organisations.
Residents left their homes to find buildings torn in half by airstrikes or reduced to mounds of concrete. Cars were flattened and trees burned out on residential streets.
Radwan Abu al-Kass, a boxing instructor, said he had been one of the last to evacuate his five-storey building in al-Rimal after the area came under attack. He finally left when a missile hit the building, which was destroyed by a bigger strike after he got out. “The whole district was just erased,” he said.
Three Gaza journalists were killed when an Israeli missile hit a building while they were outside reporting, bringing the number of journalists killed to six.
Amid warnings from UN agencies of looming humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, home to 2.3 million people, Lt-Col Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesperson, advised Palestinians to “get out” of Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt on its southern border, before clarifying that the crossing remained closed.
Gaza’s sole border crossing with Egypt, the only entry point not controlled by Israel, was hit by an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday for the third time in 24 hours, an Egyptian NGO said.
Aid organisations have pleaded for the creation of humanitarian corridors to get aid into Gaza, saying hospitals overwhelmed with wounded people were running out of supplies. Israel has stopped all food, fuel and medicines to Gaza.
The World Health Organization said there had been 11 attacks on healthcare sites, which included medical facilities, ambulances and care providers, in the first 36 hours of the new conflict in Gaza. “There is an urgent need to establish a humanitarian corridor for unimpeded, life-saving patient referrals and movement of humanitarian personnel and essential health supplies,” the WHO said.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said that more than 187,000 people had been displaced across the Gaza Strip, with that number expected to increase.
Ali Barakeh, a member of Hamas’s exiled leadership in Beirut, said the group was prepared for a prolonged war. “We have prepared well for this war and to deal with all scenarios, even the scenario of the long war,” he said, adding that Hamas intended to exchange Israeli hostages held in Gaza for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, and even some in the US.
Barakeh’s comments came after statements by another senior Hamas official, Moussa Abu Marzouk, who told the broadcaster Al Jazeera that the group was open to discussing a possible truce with Israel after having “achieved its targets”.
The escalating conflict on Israel’s borders is increasing concern that the violence could spread.
The Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, said on Tuesday that the escalation of hostilities between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza was “very serious”, warning of repercussions on the region’s “security and stability”.
Sisi, whose government maintains ties with Israel and Hamas, said Egypt had intensified its efforts to reach a ceasefire, according to the state-run Mena news agency. “We are communicating with all international and regional parties in order to reach an immediate cessation of violence and achieve de-escalation,” he was quoted as saying.

How should the US respond to the Israel-Palestine crisis? Our panel weighs in | Panelists,2023-10-10,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/10/how-should-the-us-respond-to-the-israel-palestine-crisis-our-panel-weighs-in,"Joe Biden said on Monday that ‘the American people stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Israelis’
It now seems that the Middle East is poised on the edge of a broader regional war. Whether or not this was the goal of the Hamas invasion of towns and cities deep inside Israel, it is the result. Israel has suffered its deadliest day since the state’s founding, and the gruesome, unspeakable images of whole families shot in their homes and kidnapped Israeli children, women, youth and the elderly have galvanized almost the entire country in support of an overwhelming use of force against the Gaza Strip.
Israeli leaders have promised that the ongoing bombardment of Gaza is just the beginning; this is, I fear, the precipice of a major atrocity in Gaza, perhaps on a scale that has not been seen this century. Contrary to those on the left who were quick to hail the Hamas attack as the opening act of putative uprising, it is more likely to be remembered as an act of will-to-suicide that will all but certainly result in immeasurable Palestinian suffering. Though it is unlikely to do so, the US has the power to stop the bloodshed. It must exert maximum pressure on Israel and Hamas to do what basic human decency dictates: free the Israeli hostages immediately, end the bombing and end the blockade of Gaza. But there can be no return to the status-quo ante of indefinite occupation in the West Bank and siege of Gaza, the underlying conditions against which Palestinians have long struggled. There is only one viable alternative to endless bloodshed: to reach a just, long-term resolution to this conflict that enables Palestinians and Israelis alike to live in peace and dignity. Failure to reach such an accord will result in something too terrible to contemplate.

On Saturday, shortly after fighters from Gaza launched a brazen surprise attack on Israeli soldiers and civilians, the US state department’s office of Palestinian affairs condemned the attack, before urging “all sides” to refrain from retaliation. Then the office deleted the tweet. In doing so, the Biden administration appeared to be sending a message: Israel’s response to the deadly attacks would have the full backing of the US government, and there would be no immediate calls for Israeli restraint. President Biden’s first statement on the attacks underscored this approach. “We stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel,” said Biden. “Israel has a right to defend itself and its people.”
In doing so, the Biden administration is throwing its full weight behind an Israeli government dominated by extremist ministers bent on annexing the West Bank and expelling and killing as many Palestinians as it can. The Biden administration reportedly plans to send additional military aid to Israel in the coming weeks, on top of the $3.8bn in weapons it already gives Israel every year. Gone, for now at least, is the White House’s typical response to the Netanyahu government’s provocations toward Palestinians: mild criticism and calls to refrain from escalation. In its place is unequivocal support for Israel, even as Israel’s defense minister announces his intention to impose a total siege of Gaza in which no electricity, food or water would get in, and as Israeli warplanes fire US-made missiles that collapse residential buildings and kill entire Palestinian families.
Israel’s punishing response will likely go on for weeks and include a ground invasion, which promises a high number of civilian casualties and widespread destruction of homes, roads and infrastructure. With the US refusing to restrain Israel, the consequences for Palestinians will be nothing short of catastrophic. Instead of urging immediate ceasefire and negotiations, Biden is giving the green light to an extremist coalition to do what it wants with Gaza.

There are two paths before the United States at this critical moment. The path it seems to be walking down now is backing Israel to the hilt as the country carries out yet another massive military campaign in the Gaza Strip, where it will inevitably kill masses of civilians who have been living under a brutal military occupation and siege for years. This would be done with no prospect of resolving the core issues and a certainty of engendering much more hatred.
The other path is one the US has generally failed to take, and that is to make an immediate and genuine effort to resolve the root causes of political violence in Palestine by addressing the long-standing grievances of the Palestinian people, who have been denied their basic rights to freedom and dignity by the US’s ally, Israel.
The easiest and laziest thing the US can do is condemn Palestinian violence yet ignore the causes of that violence. Worse yet, the US can continue to support those causes through its unchecked backing of Israeli military occupation. Doing so, however, will only consign more people, Palestinian and Israeli alike, to be victims of future episodes of political violence.

We are witnessing unprecedented events in Israel-Palestine. Insecurity is everywhere. There has been a total breakdown of the systems and structures that Israelis depend on to protect them and provide the services and information they need. Insecurity is also present for the people of Gaza, which has been under siege for 16 years, as well as the West Bank, where military occupation creates untenably insecure lives for Palestinians.
Americans should contribute to any efforts that ensure that Israelis are not left helpless with an extremist government that has shown not only how little it values Palestinian lives, but also how incompetent it is at caring for its own citizens. There are groups of people living in Israel who are extremely vulnerable – Bedouins in the south who have no access to bomb shelters; asylum seekers and migrants stranded with little access to Israel’s welfare infrastructure; and kibbutz communities that have lost everything. There are extremists inside and outside this Israeli government who are inciting violence against Arab Palestinian citizens and calling for revenge in cities where Jews and Arabs live side by side.
Right now, people around the world must retain a sense of humanity for all innocent and suffering people. We must voice that compassion, contribute to relief efforts and do everything in our power to deescalate. In the longer term, Americans must raise our voices to ensure that the future is not only one where this can never happen again, but one in which all people – Israelis and Palestinians – are free from oppression, occupation and terrorism.

The United States continues to be a central part of the problem fomenting instability and violence afflicting Palestinians and Israelis, as evidenced by the US’s response to Hamas’s attack. The White House described the attack as “unprovoked”, thus deliberately eliding decades of structural violence against Palestinians. Israel has subjected Palestinians to settler-colonial removal for 75 years, to the longest occupation in history for 56 years, and to a debilitating siege of Gaza holding 2.2 million Palestinians in an open-air prison for 16 years. In 2020, several Israeli and legacy international human rights organizations confirmed that Israel oversees an apartheid regime against Palestinians.
Despite this, the US has continued to provide Israel with $3.6bn annually without conditions and made Israeli normalization with Arab states a top priority, thus normalizing apartheid. Worse, the US recently designated Israel as part of its visa waiver program, seemingly rewarding that apartheid rather than sanctioning it. This is part of a legacy of US complicity with Israeli aggression. Since 1967, the US has issued 43 vetoes on the UN security council to protect Israel from accountability or to prevent international resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The pathway to a durable peace is lifting the siege, ending the occupation and dismantling Israeli apartheid. The US continues to obstruct this pathway by providing Israel unequivocal financial, military and diplomatic support, and sustaining these structures of violence.

Since the United States’ announcement of unconditional support and emergency military and other assistance to Israel, Israeli officials declared Palestinians “human animals” and proclaimed their intention to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity, if not an act of genocide. Israeli forces proceeded with bombing dozens of buildings – annihilating entire families – in an isolated territory where Palestinians have no safe place to go.
The US government bears significant responsibility for the current situation and, as a signatory to both the Geneva conventions and Genocide Convention, has obligations under international law to prevent – not further – the commission of international crimes. Israeli government officials have spent the last year openly inciting to war crimes and encouraging settler pogroms. The Israeli military has imposed a 16-year siege on Gaza – during which it conducted six deadly military assaults against a population living in one of the most densely populated places on earth. The Biden administration has not simply been silent, it has rewarded such crimes at every turn.
Now, rather than deescalate a situation to prevent further loss of life, the most powerful countries in the world, led by the US, have communicated a carte blanche to Israelis.
This international abandonment has come regardless of which avenues Palestinians pursued: Palestinians have appealed to every international institution available, holding weekly nonviolent marches despite being met with snipers and tear gas, and leading campaigns to boycott Israeli apartheid. They have pushed every possible lever, and the US has dismissed them, impeded their efforts or restricted their protest.
Recognizing the root causes of the current violence doesn’t require condoning attacks on civilians. Offering context is not offering an excuse. On the contrary: the only way to honor the loss of life – Palestinian and Israeli – is to address its source. The US must end its complicity in Israeli apartheid, systemic oppression, military occupation and collective punishment – not double down on its support.

EU aid to Palestinians will ‘not be cancelled’ as decision reversed,2023-10-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/eu-aid-to-palestinians-will-not-be-cancelled-as-decision-reversed,"EU foreign ministers back continued support after European commissioner declared suspension of payments
EU foreign ministers have reversed the decision by the European Commission to suspend payments to the Palestinian Authority, after an emergency meeting in Oman.
Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief diplomat, said the “overwhelming majority” of EU states were in favour of continued support, adding the funds would “not be cancelled”.
He also said some of Israel’s actions in response to the Hamas attack at the weekend breached international law. Israel has launched airstrikes from land and sea on the Gaza Strip and pledged to enforce a total siege on the densely populated territory.
“Israel has the right to defend [itself] but it has to be done accordingly with international law, humanitarian law, and some decisions are contrary to international law,” Borrell said after a meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers in Muscat.
“Some of the actions – and the United Nations has already said that – [such] as cutting water, cutting electricity, cutting food to a mass of civilian people is against international law,” Borrell said.
Tuesday’s decision to maintain funding came after the EU was forced to backpedal after the commissioner for neighbourhood and enlargement, Olivér Várhelyi, unexpectedly declared that the 27-nation bloc was immediately suspending “all payments” to the Palestinians. The Hungarian commissioner has long been a critic of aspects of EU aid to Palestine, but it appears he acted without any legal authority or sufficient political support.
The episode is understood to have infuriated Borrell, who said on Tuesday that the EU would be able to review donations to ensure there was no “leakage” of money to Hamas.
But some EU states have decided to suspend their national contributions pending an investigation. Denmark and Sweden announced they were suspending Palestinian development aid but maintaining humanitarian assistance following the Hamas militant group’s attack on Israel.
The government in Copenhagen said in a statement it had “decided to put Danish development assistance to Palestine on hold”.
“A thorough review will be conducted to ensure that no Danish funding is misused to indirectly support terrorist organisations that attack Israel,” it said. The review will be conducted “in close dialogue with Denmark’s partners in the EU and the Nordic countries”.
For 2023, Denmark had earmarked humanitarian and development aid totalling 235.5m kroner ($33.5m) for the Palestinian territories. About 72m kroner of development aid has yet to be disbursed. “It is this assistance that is now being put on hold,” the statement said.
Sweden also said it was suspending development aid but did not provide any immediate details on the amount.
The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that like the European Commission, Germany regularly reviewed its assistance for the Palestinian territories.
“In this emergency situation we are once again scrutinising not only our development cooperation but also our humanitarian assistance, in close consultation with the United Nations,” she said. “We agree, however, that it would be quite wrong at this point in time to halt vital humanitarian assistance for the civilian population. Millions of people, including many children, in the Palestinian territories depend on us for the provision of food, water and medicines.”
The EU decision came after Gulf leaders issued a joint statement with the EU after a meeting in Muscat calling for aid not to be suspended. The statement “stressed the importance of sustained financial support for UNRWA (the UN agency for Palestinians) , the Palestinian Authority, and for the humanitarian and development needs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.
The UN humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, said humanitarian relief and vital services and supplies to Gaza must not be blocked.
Speaking from New York, he added: “The whole region is at a tipping point. The violence must stop. My message to all sides is unequivocal: the laws of war must be upheld.
“Those held captive must be treated humanely. Hostages must be released without delay. Throughout hostilities, civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected. Civilians must be allowed to leave for safer areas.”

‘We’re focused on maximum damage’: ground offensive into Gaza seems imminent,2023-10-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/right-now-it-is-one-day-at-a-time-life-on-israels-frontline-with-gaza,"Surrounded by evidence of heavy fighting and with air raid sirens still sounding, Road 232 is the new frontline between Israel and the enclave
Road 232, an Israeli highway, runs parallel to the blockaded Gaza Strip. It is surrounded by flat agricultural land in every direction, and from it the higher floors of the overcrowded enclave’s high rise buildings are clearly visible, about 3 miles (5km) away.
Now, the route appears to have become the new de facto boundary between territory controlled by Israel and Hamas, the Islamist movement that launched a devastating surprise sea, land and air offensive on 20 neighbouring kibbutzim and Israeli towns last weekend. They slaughtered more than 1,000 people, and abducted dozens more to be used as bargaining chips. More than 900 people in Gaza have been killed in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes.
It is not just a new border: it is a new frontline. Early on Tuesday, four days into the fifth round of war since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that Israel’s perimeter with the strip had finally been secured – but by midmorning, that was no longer the case.
The boom and crump of airstrikes and artillery, along with the rattle of automatic gunfire, echoed across the empty fields; a convoy of Israeli tanks roared past, sending soil and dust metres up into the air. Two military helicopters hovered overhead and jumpy soldiers at checkpoints bristled at every distant movement. Huge plumes of black smoke rose above Gaza.
Kibbutz Re’im, off Road 232, is where 260 partygoers at an all-night rave were massacred at daybreak on Saturday. Survivors have told of playing dead next to bodies of their friends and watching women being raped before they were shot in the head, or tied up and burned. On the outskirts of the kibbutz, the bodies of Israelis have now all been removed. Those of the men who murdered them remain.
On the sides of the road were the rotting corpses of five men, stripped to their underwear, after being checked for explosives. All were surrounded by piles of clothing and military equipment bearing the green insignia of Hamas, and the white of Palestinian Islamic Jihad. One was missing his head. Shot-up and abandoned cars bearing both Israeli and Palestinian licence plates were scattered up and down the highway.
In Sderot, a working class town on the north-east corner of Gaza, the situation was not much better. Katry Kamenetski, 48, who moved to Israel from Moldova six years ago, never really liked the place. But after hiding in her apartment with her 23-year-old daughter for four days, watching the battle between Israeli forces and gunmen who seized the police station over the road, she was happy to get outside on Tuesday, even if air raid sirens meant ducking into public bomb shelters every so often.
“There were Israeli snipers on our roof, we could hear them. The electricity and water kept going off. We sat in the dark with absolutely no idea what was going on … I am only learning the full picture today,” she said.
“We got very contradictory messages. Sometimes, the municipality WhatsApp or social media said it was OK to go out, everything was over, even though it wasn’t. They were still finding terrorists in searches of houses.
“On Monday, my boss actually asked if I was going to be coming into the office.”
As she spoke, the sound of bulldozers demolishing the police station could be heard over the road. The IDF regained control over it on Sunday after an intense firefight. Ten militants were killed in what Israel’s armed forces call a “pressure cooker” operation – steadily increasing fire on a building in which armed Palestinians are holed up, and using increasingly heavy weaponry, from more and more angles, until either they surrender or the building caves in on them. In almost all cases, it is the latter.
Elsewhere in the centre of Sderot, a town of 28,000 people, there was evidence of heavy fighting on a main street; a playground on one side of the road, a library on the other, and burnt-out, bullet-riddled vehicles in between. A missile thudded into a building a few streets over and the air defence system began to blare constantly as a car carrying two volunteers showed up.
Netan El, 19, from central Israel, shrugged off questions about the danger he faced in delivering food and supplies to families in the town. “It’s what we do,” he said.
On Monday night, Israelis were told by the Home Front to prepare a safe place to shelter and enough food, water and other supplies to last 72 hours – a clear sign that a ground offensive into Gaza is imminent. The move will undoubtedly claim many more Palestinian and Israeli lives. Speaking on Tuesday morning, IDF spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari made the startling admission that “thousands of tonnes of munitions” had already been dropped on the tiny strip, adding that “while balancing accuracy with the scope of damage, right now we’re focused on what causes maximum damage”.
The question now is whether the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will continue with his promise to “flatten” the enclave, home to 2.3 million trapped civilians, or re-occupy it. Israel pulled out occupying ground forces from Gaza in 2005. The strip was taken over by Hamas during the Palestinian civil war with the secular Fatah party two years after that, leading Israel and Egypt to besiege it, and there have now been five wars and several smaller escalations between Israel and Gaza’s fighting factions since.
There are also growing signs that the fighting on the Gaza front will drag in other actors and theatres. Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said on Tuesday that his ministry would be providing 10,000 rifles to civilian security teams in border towns, as well as mixed Jewish-Arab cities and Israeli settlements in the West Bank, where over the last 18 months tensions have reached their highest levels for 20 years.
To Israel’s north, the Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah, has threatened to join the fray if a ground invasion of Gaza is launched. The group has already claimed responsibility for rocket fire into Israel, and deadly clashes have erupted on the border.
“When I moved here, I thought: ‘This is awful. How do the families and the babies cope with all of this?’” said Kamenetski, the survivor from Sderot.
“You do kind of get used to it. But I am not thinking about the possibility of a bigger war. Right now it is one day at a time.”
 The headline and text of this article were amended on 5 December 2023. An earlier version used a mistranslated quote of R Adm Daniel Hagari saying “hundreds of tonnes of bombs” had already been dropped on Gaza and that “the emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy”. In fact, he said “thousands of tonnes of munitions” had been dropped and “while balancing accuracy with the scope of damage, right now we’re focused on what causes maximum damage”.

‘Murdered in cold blood’: stories emerge of Israelis killed at Gaza border,2023-10-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/murdered-in-cold-blood-stories-emerge-of-israelis-killed-at-gaza-border-hamas-israel,"Friends and relatives say Hamas killed a grandmother, parents protecting their children, and an entire family during raids
A little after 11pm on Sunday, the Israeli government posted a photograph of a family on one of its social media accounts. There were five people in the selfie: a mother, a father and their three young children, all of them smiling.
“Tamar, Yonatan and their children Shachar, Arbel, Omer,” the caption read. “An entire family wiped out by Hamas terrorists. There are no words. May their memory be a blessing.”
Moments later, the former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett reposted the photo.
“An entire family murdered in cold blood,” he wrote. “Look at their happy faces. Their love. All of them murdered by Palestinian terrorists at Nir Oz kibbutz. Just because they’re Jews.”
Although it remains unclear exactly what happened to the Kedem family on their kibbutz, which lies a mile and a half from the border with Gaza, their picture – and the story of their murders – has been widely shared to illustrate the utter pitilessness and ferocity of Hamas’s attack on Israel.
According to friends in Australia, the family rushed to their safe room when the assaults began, from where they sent a WhatsApp message.
“Hi guys, we got into the shelter in our house, we’re all going okay,” the text read.
An hour later, however, Tamar had stopped responding to messages from Yishai and Mor Lacob, her friends in Sydney.
“It started to get really scary,” Mor Lacob told the Sydney Morning Herald. “We’re trying to call her, message her. We were trying to speak with people there … people we might know in this area, we were harassing everyone.”
The Lacobs said they had later been told that the safe room had been breached and that Tamar, Yonatan, Shachar, Arbel and Omer had been murdered.
Mor Lacob said her friend Tamar, a women’s rights activist and community leader, would be remembered for her kindness and sense of social justice.
“She was such a special woman,” Mor Lacob told the paper. “She always cared about the poor people, always made sure that people less fortunate will have the same opportunities. She was a living example to these values.”
On Sunday morning, a volunteer at Nir Oz, a community of about 400 people, said residents had woken to “a kibbutz in flames” and were “still passing around checking damages and trying to figure out who is where”.
As the hours passed, another horrific account emerged from the same kibbutz. Relatives of an as-yet-unnamed woman said their grandmother had been murdered by the militants, who then filmed her dying moments and posted them on her Facebook page.
“My grandmother, a resident of kibbutz Nir Oz all her life, was murdered yesterday in a brutal murder by a terrorist in her home,” her granddaughter, Mor Bayder wrote on Facebook on Sunday.
“A terrorist came home to her, killed her, took her phone, filmed the horror and published it on her Facebook wall. This is how we found out.”
Another of the woman’s grandchildren, Yoav Shimoni, who had visited her on the kibbutz two weeks earlier to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, said the family believed she had been targeted because of her house’s proximity to the border fence.
“I assume she was the first point of contact for one of the terrorists that infiltrated,” Shimoni told CNN. “They then came into her house, shot her down, took her phone and then put her dying video on Facebook.”
He described his grandmother as a “super happy, super confident” and optimistic person who was always in high spirits and always thinking of her family.
Another atrocity on the nearby Re’im kibbutz was reported on Facebook by Reut Karp, who said her children’s father, Dvir Karp, had been murdered.
At 8.20am on Sunday, “terrorists entered Dvir’s house. He threw an axe at them,” she said. Dvir Karp had tried to protect the children, she wrote, but he was killed in front of them. His girlfriend “also tried, but they killed her too”.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Hannah Ben-Artzi, a 69-year-old woman from Kfar Aviv, central Israel, had been killed by a rocket while trying to open a public shelter for those who did not have shelters in their own homes.
The international dimension of the attacks was underscored by the number of dual nationals, Israelis of foreign descent and foreigners caught up in the bloodshed. The Chilean government offered its condolences to the family of Itay Berdichevsky, an Israeli citizen with a Chilean grandfather who was murdered along with his wife, Hadar. The couple, both 30, are believed to have placed their 10-month-old twins in a hidden shelter when they heard the militants at the door.
“Itay and Hadar were brutally murdered after fighting bravely against the terrorists,” according to Gali Dagan, Israel’s ambassador to Colombia. “The babies, who had been on their own for more than 12 hours, were rescued. Imagine the horror. Two terrified parents doing everything they could to save their children, who are now orphans. Blessed be the memory of these heroes.”

Humza Yousaf calls for UK to push for Gaza humanitarian corridor,2023-10-10,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/10/humza-yousaf-calls-for-uk-to-push-for-gaza-humanitarian-corridor,"Scottish first minister says he has made contact with his wife’s parents who are trapped in besieged enclave after Hamas attack
Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, has called on the UK foreign secretary to push for the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians from Gaza.
Yousaf revealed on Monday that his wife Nadia’s parents, who live in Dundee, are trapped in Gaza and struggling to find safe passage.
In a letter to James Cleverly on Tuesday, Yousaf reiterated his condemnation of the “abhorrent terrorist actions of Hamas”.
“Too many innocent people have already lost their lives as a consequence of these completely unjustifiable and illegitimate attacks by Hamas,” Yousaf wrote. He added: “Innocent men, women and children cannot, and should not, pay the price for the actions of a terrorist group.
“Collective punishment of innocent civilians cannot be justified and will do nothing to set the conditions for peace in the region.”
Yousaf continued: “As a close friend and ally of Israel, I therefore ask the UK government to call on the government of Israel to ensure innocent civilians are protected and to put in place an immediate ceasefire to allow the safe passage of civilians through the Rafah border.
“Furthermore, it should open a humanitarian corridor into Gaza to allow supplies, including food, fuel, water and medical supplies, for those civilians who are trapped, helpless and cannot leave.”
Yousaf’s in-laws, Maged and Elizabeth El-Nakla, had been visiting his father-in-law’s 92-year-old mother when the first Hamas attack took place at the weekend.
On Tuesday evening, Yousaf said he had made contact with his in-laws and that they were safe “for now” but also “terrified”.
He told the BBC: “I think the worst thing is that they feel literally trapped. They’re being told to leave … but they have nowhere to go.
“The Rafah border [with Egypt] had been bombed and even if it was open, there’s no guarantee of safe passage travelling between where they live and the Rafah border.”
He added that his brother-in-law, who is a doctor in Gaza, had said medical supplies “are at the lowest he’s ever seen, to the point where they’re having to use bits of their own clothes to try to bandage and tourniquet wounds where they can”.
Yousaf had told the corporation on Monday that “despite the best efforts of the British Foreign Office, nobody can guarantee them safe passage anywhere”.
“So I’m in a situation where we don’t know whether or not my mother-in-law and father-in-law, who have nothing to do – as most Gazans don’t – with Hamas or with any terror attack, will make it through the night or not.”
Yousaf ended his letter to Cleverly: “Finally, I call on the international community to be proactive and work towards an immediate ceasefire and a long-lasting peace that sees Israelis and Palestinians treated as equals.”
He said the Scottish government stood ready to assist with relief efforts.
Earlier on Tuesday, tributes were paid to Bernard Cowan, a grandfather who grew up in Glasgow before settling in Israel and who was confirmed as the first Scottish victim of Saturday’s assault by Hamas on Israel.
In a statement, his family said: “We are grieving the loss of our son and brother, Bernard Cowan, who was horrifically murdered on Saturday during the surprise terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas.
“We ask for privacy at this time while we process this huge loss to our family, both at home and in Israel, and to the Jewish community in Glasgow where he will be sorely missed.”

Russia and Saudi Arabia to continue oil price pact despite Middle East crisis,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/11/russia-and-saudi-arabia-discuss-effect-on-oil-price-of-hamas-israel-crisis,"Vladimir Putin says withholding oil will ‘most likely’ continue despite Israel-Hamas war pushing crude towards $100 a barrel
Russia and Saudi Arabia look set to extend their pact to keep oil prices higher by withholding 1% of world demand from the market, Vladimir Putin has indicated.
The Russian president announced on Wednesday that the cuts to oil supplies imposed by Saudi Arabia and Russia would “most likely” continue despite market concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could drive crude prices to $100 a barrel.
Higher global oil prices would provide a windfall for Russia, which has seen sales of gas to Europe plummet after its invasion of Ukraine last year. The rise in crude prices is also expected to frustrate western leaders struggling to contain inflation.
Putin told an industry conference in Moscow that Russia’s deal with Saudi Arabia to hold back oil supplies was “important for the predictability of the oil market, and ultimately for the wellbeing of all mankind.”
The world’s top two oil exporters met in Moscow on Wednesday to discuss the global market after the surprise attack by Hamas fighters on Israeli civilians over the weekend.
Russia’s deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, the Kremlin’s top oil official, and the Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, met in Moscow in advance of Russia’s energy week conference.
Hamas’s surprise attack last weekend ignited a surge in the global benchmark oil price, which rose by almost $4 a barrel, or more than 4%, to $88 as traders speculated that a wider escalation of the conflict across the Middle East could disrupt supplies.
Magid Shenouda, the deputy CEO of the commodity trading giant Mercuria, told an industry conference in the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday that the oil price could reach $100 a barrel if the situation in the Middle East escalated.
“I don’t think there are that many analysts that believed that it was going to go to $100 in a normal circumstance. I think the events that have happened recently put a great cloud [over] where things could go,” Shenouda said.
Crude prices rose to $90 a barrel last month after the world’s leading producers announced they would extend their coordinated production cuts until December to shore up prices.

Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to withhold a combined 1.3m barrels a day, or more than 1% of global demand, from the market until the end of the year, frustrating world leaders struggling against inflation.
Putin said: “The actions of some of our colleagues, the western elites, have sown confusion on the global energy market, including on the oil market, the negative consequences of such politicised steps affect the entire global economy, now it has to be corrected, and, of course, responsible market participants have to do it.”
Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday it was working with regional and international partners to prevent an escalation of the situation in Gaza and Israel, and reaffirmed that it supported efforts to stabilise oil markets.

‘It was a pogrom’: Be’eri survivors on the horrific attack by Hamas terrorists,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/it-was-a-pogrom-beeri-survivors-horrific-attack-hamas-terrorists,"Once popular with Israelis as a weekend getaway, Be’eri is now indelibly associated with a massacre
The smell of death hits you at the entrance to kibbutz Be’eri. Until Saturday morning Be’eri had a population of 1,200, the largest of the 12 villages that make up the Eshkol regional council that runs along the border with Gaza.
Now it is a place indelibly associated with horror and tragedy, as one of the centres of the massacre undertaken by the militant Islamist group Hamas in southern Israel beginning on Saturday morning.
Be’eri, once popular with Israelis as a weekend getaway with its art gallery and nearby mountain-biking trails, had by Tuesday been turned into a war zone, the bloated bodies of the Hamas terrorists who attacked this place still dotted around the kibbutz, and tanks and armoured cars at the entrance where Hamas smashed in.
Audible in the distance the sound of detonations can be heard coming from the direction of Gaza, outgoing artillery firing close by from the positions now occupied by the army.
Be’eri, founded two years before the state of Israel, was once a pleasant place to live with houses and apartments set apart among the trees, and grassy verges joined by little sandy roads. Now the homes are broken and violated.
In some places the doors of the surviving houses stand open as if the residents had simply left to go for a coffee at the kibbutz cafe, pictures of the families that lived here pinned with magnets to fridges.
In other places it is clear that the Hamas militants who stormed Be’eri set fire to buildings to drive out the occupants who were hiding there: to kill or capture. Mostly to kill.
Building after building has been destroyed, whether in the Hamas assault or in the fighting that followed, nearby trees splintered and walls reduced to concrete rubble from where Israeli tanks blasted the Hamas militants where they were hiding. Floors collapsed on floors. Roof beams were tangled and exposed like rib cages.
Many of the juxtapositions on Wednesday were jarring, describing how very ordinary lives were ripped utterly apart. In the kibbutz’s communal dining hall, where residents once gathered to take meals, there are still menus and posters for the kibbutz’s running club and a personal trainer.
It is also where the bodies of the dead, 108 in all, were brought and laid out to await collection by the emergency services.
Now it is the Hamas dead who are being removed by workers from Zaka, an emergency group, in white overalls and orange helmets and masks.
For the Israeli soldiers who now populate Be’eri, these are scenes promoting conflicting emotions. Moving through the kibbutz journalists shouted questions to a harried Israeli soldier who it transpires had fought there.
“When I arrived I saw soldiers fighting here just to get into the kibbutz,” he said. “We were going from apartment to apartment. We will have difficult questions to ask [in the future]. For now we have to look forwards: to the defence of the people and getting the survivors out.”
“I feel anger. I feel speechless and frustration,” said Richard Hecht an army spokesperson accompanying the international media. “You can still smell the bodies here. It’s overwhelming.”
Itai Veruv, an Israeli major general who led the fighting here, could only describe it in historic terms of the Jewish history of persecution. “What happened here was a pogrom,” he says.
It is a word that has been used repeatedly about Be’eri. “[It’s] what happened in Europe in the old days,” adds Veruv. “This was not a war. They wanted to kill and kidnap to Gaza. Women and children.”
The picture of what happened in Be’eri has been emerging piecemeal over several days. How in the space of the horrifying hours of the murderous rampage on Saturday, at least 100 people were slaughtered here, dragged from their homes and murdered or dragged off at gunpoint as hostages to Gaza.
That terrible experience was chronicled in text messages, and desperate calls to family calling for help, and in the gruesome videos shot by Hamas itself within the kibbutz.
In text messages during the attack with this Guardian reporter, one resident – who survived with their family – had pleaded for help in contacting the army as Hamas stormed neighbouring houses.
Describing sounds of nearby shooting, the resident said: “We need to get the army here. It’s not enough. Please get the army come to save us.”
Amit Man, a 25-year-old paramedic, was one of those who lived here. Her last contact was a text she sent to her sister Haviva from the kibbutz clinic, where she was treating the wounded members.
Then there was Yaffa Adar, an 85-year-old who had lived in Be’eri for most of her life. Among those missing, believed captured, there is video of Yaffa sitting surrounded by young men telling her to “smile” in Arabic.
For those residents of Be’eri still alive, things can never be the same.
“I feel like the state of Israel ceased to exist,” Amit Halevi, the 70-year-old chairman of Be’eri, told the Haaretz newspaper on Monday, echoing Veruv. “What is this, some pogrom in Lithuania?”
Uri Ben Tzvi, another survivor from Be’eri, compared his experience to one of the Holocaust’s most famous victims
“I was like Anne Frank,” said Ben Tzvi, 71, who hid with his wife in a narrow corridor in one of the kibbutz’s structures. “It was a pogrom. Like going back to the Kishinev pogrom,” he said referring to a 1903 series of massacres in what is now Moldova.

‘Pacifist at his core’: Britons missing and feared dead in Hamas attacks ,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/pacifist-at-his-core-britons-missing-and-feared-dead-in-hamas-attacks,"Seventeen British nationals, including children, have died or are missing after atrocities in Israel
Seventeen British nationals, including children, are feared dead or missing in Israel after attacks by Hamas, the Guardian understands. The atrocities have so far claimed at least 2,100 lives.
Nathanel Young, 20, was serving as a corporal in the Israeli army when he was killed in Saturday’s attack.
In a statement to the BBC, his brother, Eliot Young, said: “Nathanel was full of life and the life of the party. He loved his family and friends and was loved by everyone.”
He described him as a talented DJ and music lover who had “strong Jewish pride”. Hundreds of people attended Nathanel’s funeral at Israel’s national cemetery, Mount Herzl, this week. Mourners referred to the former pupil at JFS, a Jewish school in north London, as “the lone soldier”, saying they had come to ensure he was not buried alone.
At the funeral, Young’s family paid tribute to him as someone who loved playing with his four nieces before the service was interrupted by air force sirens.
Jake Marlowe, who went to the same school as Nathanel before moving to Israel, was part of the security team at the Supernova music festival where 260 people were killed.
The 26-year-old Arsenal fan and musician was reported missing after the attack and his parents, Lisa and Michael Marlowe, spoke of their desperate attempts to locate him.
In a Facebook post on Wednesday, his mother said: “We are heartbroken to have to inform you the crushing news that our son Jake has been confirmed dead in southern Israel.
“Repatriation plans are being put in to place, more information will follow. Please respect our privacy at this most devastating time.”
Bernard Cowan, 57, who grew up in Glasgow and lived near the border with Gaza with his wife and three children, was also killed, according to his family.
In a statement, they said: “We are grieving the loss of our son and brother, Bernard Cowan, who was horrifically murdered on Saturday during the surprise terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas.
“We ask for privacy at this time while we process this huge loss to our family, both at home and in Israel, and to the Jewish community in Glasgow where he will be sorely missed.”
Dan Darlington, a 34-year-old photographer, was reported to have been killed on Saturday at Nir Oz, a kibbutz in southern Israel, according to an Instagram post by his sister, Shelley.
In Tuesday’s post she said she was living in a “waking nightmare”, adding: “Only days before he was riding his bike, laughing, taking photos of sunsets and enjoying life’s simple pleasures in our beautiful kibbutz.
“He was meant to leave for Tel Aviv the night before but decided to stay one more day to explore the kibbutz with his friend – a decision that has irrevocably changed all our lives forever, and one that cost him his life.”
She described him as gentle, kind and “a pacifist at his core”.
Dor Shafir, 30, was reported missing by his British mother, Miryam Shafir, after attending the Supernova music festival with his fiancee, Savion Kiper, 31.
Miryam, who described her son as British and Irish, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain on Tuesday that Kiper’s body had been found but that there was no sign of Dor. The 55-year-old urged the UK government to help trace missing Britons and said she was “praying” that her son, who worked in podcasting, was still alive.
But in a Facebook post on Wednesday, which has been translated from Hebrew into English, she said: “The Shafir family announces with great sorrow the murder of their son Dor.”

How Israel-Hamas war disinformation is being spread online,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/11/how-israel-hamas-war-disinformation-is-being-spread-online,"Case of footage from set of Palestinian film being repurposed to make false claims is far from one-off
The video shows a young boy in a black T-shirt apparently lying in a pool of blood on the ground. Above him is a camera, with a man shouting directions near him. Two men in kippahs, the Jewish skull caps, and men in green military fatigues similar to Israel Defence Forces (IDF) uniforms are gathered around him.
The clip has been viewed about 2m times on X, formerly known as Twitter. It was shared by a verified user with the caption: “Video showing Israel attempting to create fake footage of deaths.”
In fact, the clip is a behind-the-scenes shot from a Palestinian short film, Empty Place, which focuses on the vacuum left by Palestinians who fled due to the Israeli occupation. It seems to have originated on TikTok before finding its way to X – but while the original TikTok post now appears to be unavailable, on X it has continued to circulate and gain traction.
The user behind the X post that attracted 2m views later acknowledged the clip may have been used out of context.
It is far from a one-off. Since Hamas launched an attack on Israel on Saturday morning, X has been flooded with disinformation and misinformation that has heightened tensions across the globe. Disinformation refers to the deliberate spread of false information, while misinformation is when someone unwittingly spreads or believes the false information to be true.
Another video, originating from TikTok but now unavailable there, has racked up 2m views on X claiming to show high-profile Israeli generals captured by Hamas fighters. In actuality, the video was originally published by the official YouTube channel of the state security service of Azerbaijan last week, and shows arrested former leaders of the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh government.
A doctored document suggesting that Joe Biden gave $8bn in assistance to Israel appeared on X last week and was viewed 400,000 times. The faked memo was an edited version of the US president’s July memo where he announced $400m in aid to Ukraine. There is no such document on the White House website or social media. The White House confirmed to NBC that the document was fake.
Russia has been a longstanding culprit for spreading disinformation on X, and appears to have been capitalising on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On Monday the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, tweeted: “Well, Nato buddies, you’ve really got it, haven’t you? The weapons handed to the Nazi regime in Ukraine are now being actively used against Israel.”
Another video, apparently showing Hamas thanking Ukraine for the sale of weapons it plans to use against Israel, was posted by an X account linked to the Russian mercenary group Wagner. It has since been viewed more than 300,000 times and amplified by far-right accounts from the US.
In February, the Pentagon’s inspector general reported that there was no evidence to date of weapons and aid to Ukraine being diverted to third parties, while Ukrainian intelligence this week accused Russia of placing “trophy” western weapons seized from battlefields in Ukraine with Hamas to undermine support for Kyiv.
Eliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative outlet Bellingcat, also flagged up a fake video purporting to be from the BBC that claimed to feature a Bellingcat investigation showing Ukraine smuggled weapons to Hamas. He said it was being pushed by Russian social media users but added it was unclear if this was a Russian government disinformation campaign or a grassroots effort.
At the centre of growing concerns over fake news related to the Israel-Hamas conflict is Elon Musk, the owner of X and a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” who has faced serious accusations of disseminating conspiracy theories and antisemitism on the platform, which he denies.
Since his takeover and rebranding of Twitter in 2022, Musk dissolved the platform’s Trust and Safety Council, which was responsible for addressing global content moderation and hate speech and harassment. The company said it had plans to reorganise this team, but they remain unclear.
In the past year, Musk has fired two heads of trust and safety on X, and is locked in a legal dispute with his co-lead of threat disruption at X, whose responsibilities included advising leadership on “vision and strategy for content moderation”.
X has introduced Community Notes, a programme for crowdsourced moderation that largely places the onus on users to correct facts instead of employed content moderators.
In recent weeks, Musk has been criticised over the spread of antisemitic content on the platform. While he said in a post that he was “pro-free speech, but against antisemitism of any kind”, the director of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, accused him of “amplifying” messages from neo-Nazis. The league, said antisemitic posts on X increased sharply after Musk bought the site, prompting him to threaten to sue.
He has also engaged with or posted content targeting the Hungarian-American businessman and philanthropist George Soros, who has been a regular target for conspiracy theorists.
On Tuesday the European Commission issued a letter to Musk warning him over alleged disinformation on X about the Hamas attack on Israel, including fake news and “repurposed old images”. It is understood that X is cooperating with the EU’s request to provide information but it will be some time before Brussels takes any further steps.
Pat de Brún, deputy director at Amnesty Tech, said: “Social media platform companies like Meta and X have clear responsibilities under international human rights standards, such as the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, and these responsibilities are heightened in times of crisis and conflict.
“Social media firms are responsible for identifying and responding effectively to risks and taking effective measures to limit the spread of harmful content – the amplification of which can lead to human rights abuses. However, all too often, big tech companies have failed to step up in the face of such emergencies, enabling hate and misinformation to proliferate.”
X has been contacted for comment.

Netanyahu sets up emergency Israeli unity government and war cabinet ,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/netanyahu-sets-up-emergency-israeli-unity-government-and-war-cabinet,"Troop buildup continues in preparation for expected ground invasion of Gaza as pressure grows for humanitarian corridors
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has announced an emergency wartime government, as pressure mounts for the establishment of corridors to allow aid and medicine into the Gaza Strip and to allow civilians to leave.
Benny Gantz, a senior opposition figure and former defence minister, joined the government for the duration of the conflict.
Netanyahu, Gantz and Yoav Gallant, the defence minister, are forming a “war cabinet” as Israeli troops continued to build in the south of the country in preparation for an expected ground invasion.
In a televised address late on Wednesday, Netanyahu described atrocities that took place during the weekend attack by Hamas militants, who he said shot children in the head, burned people alive, raped women and beheaded soldiers. “Every Hamas member is a dead man,” he said. “We will crush and destroy it.”
Gantz told Israeli citizens that the newly formed government was “united” and ready to “wipe this thing called Hamas off the face of the Earth”.
Netanyahu’s extreme rightwing coalition partners will continue to serve in the government. The country’s chief opposition leader, Yair Lapid, was invited to join the new cabinet but did not immediately respond to the offer.
Inside Gaza, the enclave’s sole power station ran out of fuel, adding to the looming catastrophe particularly for hospitals. “Soon all services vital for the survival of the population, including hospitals, will no longer function,” said the Mezan centre for human rights in Gaza.
Mahmoud Matar, a surgeon in Gaza, said hospitals were “completely overwhelmed with the number of injuries and the number of dead”.
He told the BBC: “The smell of death is all around now in Gaza. There is no water, there will be no electricity, and we have very bad network connection. I am currently looking for water to drink.”
Joe Biden described the assault on Israel by Hamas as “the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust during a round table of Jewish leaders in Washington on Wednesday evning.
The US president said Saturday’s attack was “sheer evil” and a “campaign of pure cruelty against the Jewish people”.
“Silence is complicity,” Biden said. “I refuse to be silent”. He said he had spoken again today with Netanyahu and that the US is “surging” additional military assistance to the Israel Defense Forces.
“This attack was a campaign of pure cruelty, not just hate, but pure cruelty, against the Jewish people,” Biden said, adding: “I never really thought that I would see, have confirmed, pictures of terrorists beheading children.”
A White House spokesperson later confirmed to the Washington Post that neither US officials nor Biden had seen photographs or confirmed such reports independently and that Biden had “based his comments about the alleged atrocities on the claims from Netanyahu’s spokesman”.
The UN humanitarian agency OCHA described a “mass displacement” in the Gaza Strip, with more than 263,000 people fleeing their homes. It said that number was expected to rise further.
The death toll that began in Saturday’s carnage, carried out by Hamas militants and airstrikes on Gaza by Israeli forces, rose again.
Israel said 1,200 people had been killed and more than 2,700 injured as bodies were still being recovered from towns and communities near the Gaza border. Israel believes Hamas is holding about 150 Israeli hostages inside Gaza.
The Gaza health ministry said about 1,100 Palestinians had been killed and 5,339 wounded in airstrikes on the crowded enclave in the past five days.
Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, was due to fly to Israel on Wednesday to show solidarity with its ally and to discuss military support.
The US has been involved in discussions about a safe passage to allow civilians in Gaza to leave to blockaded territory, now under intense bombardment. The border crossing between Gaza and Egypt has been closed since the conflict began.
In comments that are potentially extremely damaging for Netanyahu, a senior Republican said a warning of potential violence came three days before the attack.
“We know that Egypt has warned the Israelis three days prior that an event like this could happen,” Michael McCaul, the chair of the powerful US House foreign affairs committee, told reporters after a closed-door intelligence briefing for lawmakers on the crisis.
“I don’t want to get too much into classified but a warning was given. I think the question was at what level,” he said.
The attack may have been planned as long as a year ago, McCaul said. “We’re not quite sure how we missed it. We’re not quite sure how Israel missed it.”
Sirens sounded across the south and the north of Israel on Wednesday. The Israeli military said hostile aircraft had entered the country from Lebanon, and urged citizens to take shelter. Some reports suggested drones or hang-gliders had been deployed by Hezbollah militants.
Earlier, Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli military position, claiming to have killed and wounded troops. The Israeli military confirmed the attack but did not comment on possible casualties. The Israeli army shelled the area in southern Lebanon where the attack was launched.
António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said a spillover of the conflict in Israel must be avoided and that he was concerned about reported attacks from southern Lebanon.
“I appeal to all parties, and those who have an influence over those parties, to avoid any further escalation and spillover,” he said.
Meanwhile, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic became the latest carriers to announce they were suspending all flights to and from Tel Aviv, citing security concerns.
The BA announcement came after the captain of a flight approaching the airport turned back to Heathrow. A spokesperson for Israel’s airports authority said rockets were flying around Tel Aviv at the time but were not an immediate threat to the flight or to the airport.
James Cleverly, the UK foreign secretary, was forced to take shelter while visiting Ofakim, a community in southern Israel. Cleverly flew to Israel to demonstrate the UK’s “unwavering solidarity”.
Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, a spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces, said on Wednesday morning that 300,000 reservists had been sent south, close to Gaza, and were getting ready “to execute the mission we have been given by the Israeli government … to make sure that Hamas, at the end of this war, won’t have any military capabilities by which they can threaten or kill Israeli civilians”.
Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israel on Saturday morning, firing thousands of rockets and breaching the hi-tech security fence around Gaza to allow hundreds of militants to cross into Israel.
Israelis, including the very old, the very young and at least 260 people at a music festival in the area, were killed in scenes of horror that have shocked the world.
On Wednesday it was confirmed that the dead included Jake Marlowe, a 26-year-old British man who had been working on the festival’s security team. His parents said they were heartbroken.

‘Together we will win’: Israelis fearful but defiant in face of uncertainty,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/together-we-will-win-israelis-fearful-but-defiant-in-face-of-uncertainty,"Overwhelming response to call-up as country prepares for ‘retaliation like never before’ against Hamas
Avi Solomon cannot serve in Israel’s armed forces because he is blind, but he has about 20 close relatives who have been called up to fight. They include four brothers and more than a dozen nephews and cousins, and he accepts that they may not all come back.
“We feel like zombies anyway,” said the 39-year-old, an athlete and supermarket worker. “If we can’t feel safe in our own houses, if we can’t promise a future for our children, if any terrorist can come here and do the same thing to us, there is no point to be some kind of living dead.”
Israelis are suspended between fear, grief and grim preparation for more losses, as details of massacres of families in their homes emerge from southern areas, and the country prepares for a major operation against Hamas in Gaza.
Normal life has been put on hold. Schools have been closed on a rolling basis, so parents are juggling full-time parenting with working from home, while trying to protect their children from both actual attacks and the corrosive trauma of fear.
Ksenia Lvovsky’s son and daughter, who are 10 and six, don’t want to shower because the air raid sirens give only 90 seconds warning to reach a shelter. They fear they might not make it in time, so she stands by as they wash, ready with a robe to throw on for a potential dash for safety.
A Ukrainian who moved to Israel 12 years ago, she still has close friends back home, and is grappling with finding both her countries at war, and her husband called up to serve.
“A year and a half ago, I was asking them how are you doing. Now they are asking me,” she said. It’s not been going on a long time like in Ukraine, but it feels the same, we are fighting for our lives.”
Like many in Israel, her fears are amplified by the sense that the country is facing a threat unprecedented in recent decades. “This is not regular for us, it is new, and if it is new, it isn’t good.”
When Hamas fighters broke out of Gaza and swarmed into Israeli communities, it upended the foundation on which a majority of Israelis had built their lives, the belief the country’s security and intelligence services could protect its citizens.
Solomon’s home town of Modi’in is dozens of kilometres from where Hamas gunmen went on a rampage, but he no longer feels safe there.
“I’m very emotional right now. It could happen to me,” he said. “I go to work and I’m anxious they will come to our house, to my children while I am away.”
Benjamin Rubin, an entrepreneur who lives in a village near Jerusalem, bought a kilometre of barbed wire on Wednesday to bolster his community’s defences.
“It never occurred to us that the army wouldn’t come to rescue us. People were calling for 12 hours before they got there, saying: ‘They are banging on our door and coming in’,” he said. “That’s the fault line”.
Delivery of the barbed wire was delayed because the driver he hired had to attend a funeral of someone killed in the war.
Israel’s relatively small population, and the scale of the losses, mean most people have a connection to grieving families, whose number is expected to rise in the coming days and weeks. With 300,000 reservists called up, there are few families untouched.
Tiferet Brown’s four brothers, her partner and her ex – the father of their three children – are all going to fight. A doctor, now single-parenting the children, she says she has been anxious in part because the country is braced for more violence but unclear what form it might take.
“There are so many theories of what could happen, things escalating or not, you don’t even know what to prepare for, don’t know what you need to organise,” she said in her apartment in the northern city of Paredes Hanna. “You never know what’s happening over the next day or two.
“It is so hard to think about going to work when I have kids that I don’t really want to leave, don’t know where I’m going to leave them, or what could happen while I’m gone. But also to stay here 24/7 with kids in the house all day long is also crazy.”
Despite the fear of what is to come, the response to the call-up has been overwhelming. Brown’s brother was in the US on a holiday meant to last two weeks when he got the call, and was with his unit by Monday. That commitment is because for Israelis the war is an existential fight, she said.
“I think the bottom line is that we do have a right to exist and some people don’t accept that,” she said. “We really don’t have another place.”
The number of reservists reporting for active duty has been so high that families and friends have been scrambling to get supplies – from plates for body armour to battery packs and even weapons – to units that were not fully stocked.
Communities have swung into crisis mode, making free meals and sorting childcare for those with partners now on active service.
The government has told people to prepare for up to 72 hours without electricity, water or medical services. Supermarkets are running out of bottled water and some food, and some ATMs have been emptied of cash.
Roads throughout the country were half empty during what would normally be rush hour, the candidate banners for local elections, scheduled for next week but now postponed, joined by patriotic messages on billboards and homemade signs.
“We have no other country,” read one with a big Israeli flag. “Together we will win,” said another on a main road through Tel Aviv. Others thanked the US president, Joe Biden, for his staunch support.
Asher Dovey fought Hamas militants from his village as his family sheltered in a saferoom. They were from an area that bore the worst of the civilian losses.
“Each one of my kids – my youngest is 10, my oldest is 14 – has lost two or three friends,” he said. He has taken their phones away to stop them seeing or reading more about the atrocities.
Like many people, he expects a political reckoning inside Israel for the security failures with “a lot of questions to be answered”, but not until there has been “a retaliation like never before” against Hamas, that he is determined to be part of.
After moving his family to a safer area, on Wednesday he returned to fight. “No question asked, it is a part of who we are. There is only one Jewish state, we have to protect our own home,” said Dovey, who is 55. “Any and all ages have to contribute.”

Humza Yousaf’s wife talks of parents’ desperate plight trapped in Gaza,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/11/humza-yousafs-wife-talks-of-parents-desperate-plight-trapped-in-gaza,"Nadia El-Nakla says Elizabeth and Maged ‘feel like they’re going to die’ in beseiged city of Deir al-Balah without power or water
Nadia El-Nakla, the wife of Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, has described the fear and desperation experienced by her parents, who are trapped in Gaza with no means of escaping Israeli bombardment.
Speaking to BBC Scotland from Bute House, the first minister’s official residence in Edinburgh, El-Nakla said her parents “continually tell me they feel like they’re going to die”.
Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla, who live in Dundee, travelled to Gaza last week to visit their son and four grandchildren, as well as Maged’s 92-year-old mother, who is unwell.
In a tearful video message shared with the BBC, Elizabeth El-Nakla described the situation in the city of Deir al-Balah, where she and her family remain besieged since Hamas gunmen killed hundreds across the border with Israel over the weekend.
“We have no electricity. We have no water. The food we do have, which is little, will not last because there’s no electricity and it will spoil.”
“I have four grandchildren in this home. A two-month-old baby, a four-year-old and, today, two nine-year-old twins, their birthday. I ask the world to help the Palestinians.”
Nadia El-Nakla continued: “No electricity means no hospital supplies. It means no food: you can’t even preserve the food that you have. Again, I don’t know what it means for them for the long term. I don’t know what’s about to happen to them.”
With no international journalists in Gaza, El-Nakla said she was struggling to get up-to-date information but wanted to preserve her parents’ phone battery life too.
“So we’ve taken numbers of neighbours. They’ve written down all our numbers. If I can’t get in touch with them, can I contact a neighbour to find out if they’re still alive? These are conversations we need to have.”
“I’m very much a planner so it’s like: how do we plan this? But at times my arms just feel like lead and it feels like I’m living in a nightmare.”
On Tuesday Yousaf called on the UK foreign secretary to push for the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians from Gaza. In a letter to James Cleverly, Yousaf reiterated his condemnation of the “abhorrent terrorist actions of Hamas”.
“Too many innocent people have already lost their lives as a consequence of these completely unjustifiable and illegitimate attacks by Hamas,” he wrote, adding: “Innocent men, women and children cannot, and should not, pay the price for the actions of a terrorist group.”

Airlines suspend all flights between UK and Israel,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/ba-suspends-flights-between-uk-and-israel-as-concerns-rise-for-trapped-britons,"BA, Virgin, easyJet and Wizz Air make decision for safety reasons as MPs and families call on UK to evacuate nationals from Gaza
British Airways, easyJet and Virgin Atlantic have suspended all flights between the UK and Tel Aviv in Israel, as countries around the world scramble to evacuate citizens amid the mounting crisis.
BA earlier had to divert a flight to Tel Aviv back to the UK because of security concerns, and said it took the decision after “the latest assessment of the situation”.
The move was influenced by the fact that sirens warning of a potential attack on Tel Aviv were going off as the diverted flight was approaching the Israeli city, which has been targeted by missiles fired from the Gaza Strip.
The development came as Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, was filmed scrambling for cover in a bunker as sirens sounded while he visited southern Israel.
While other countries have been putting on flights to repatriate citizens and dependents, there was an expectation that the UK government would continue to rely on commercial flights for as long as that provided an effective method of providing an air route for those who wanted to leave.
Another airline serving Israel and the UK, Wizz Air, had earlier suspended operations before BA. El Al, the Israeli flag carrier, was still operating services.
A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: “The safety of our customers and our teams is our number one priority, always. After careful consideration, based on latest information, we have taken the decision to pause flying to and from Tel Aviv for the next 72 hours.
“As the dynamic situation evolves, we’ll keep our flying programme under constant review. Our teams will be in contact with any affected customers to discuss their options, which include rebooking to a later date or a full refund. We would advise anyone booked to travel to check their flight status on the website before travelling to the airport.”
Alicia Kearns, the chair of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said UK had tended to rely on commercial flights, where they are possible, in terms of repatriation of citizens in situations such as those wishing to leave Israel.
“It’s not straightforward. What is different is that many people will be dual nationals, some are also in the Israeli Defense Forces and will be staying. I anticipate that as long as there are commercial flights the Foreign Office won’t be putting other flights on.
“I am gravely worried about British nationals in Gaza because of the deeply grave humanitarian situation there and risk of being killed. There are people who cannot get out, there are major challenges in terms of what crossing points could be used and there will be British doctors and others trapped in Gaza under bombardment.”
Cleverly made the trip to “demonstrate the UK’s unwavering solidarity with the Israeli people following Hamas’s terrorist attacks”, said the Foreign Office, after confirming that he had arrived and would be meeting with survivors of the Hamas attack on Israel.
“I’m here in Israel today to show that the UK’s support for the Israeli people is unwavering,” Cleverly said in a tweet, which showed him meeting a tearful Israeli woman.
The Israeli government has stopped the passage of food, water, fuel and medicine into Gaza, with the sole remaining access from Egypt shut down on Tuesday after air strikes near the border crossing.
Families and friends of British citizens and residents currently trapped in Gaza have meanwhile signed an open letter to Cleverly asking the UK government to do everything in its power to orchestrate safe passage for them to return home
“We kindly request that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office take immediate action to arrange with the Egyptian authorities to reopen the border with Gaza and facilitate the safe passage of British Gazans and their families out of the conflict zone. This is a matter of utmost urgency, as innocent lives are at risk,” added the letter, whose signatories included members of the British Jewish community, academics and the MP John McDonnell. It was organised by Keren Weitzberg, a London politics professor, whose friend is stuck in Gaza after making a trip to visit family with her baby.
Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International’s UK’s chief executive, said: “It’s entirely right that James Cleverly is offering his support to Israeli civilians who’ve suffered in these completely appalling attacks.”
He added: “Mr Cleverly should be urging all parties to the conflict, including the Israeli authorities, to respect international humanitarian law.”

‘It’s like a nightmare’: families of Hamas hostages continue agonising wait for news,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/its-like-a-nightmare-families-of-hamas-hostages-continue-agonising-wait-for-news-israel-gaza,"Israel pounds Gaza with retaliatory missile strikes as fate of 150 people thought to have been taken by Hamas remains unclear

The families of the 150 people thought to have been seized by Hamas militants over the weekend and taken to Gaza to be held as hostages are enduring an agonising wait for news of their loved ones as retaliatory Israeli missile strikes continue to pound the enclave.
Four days after Saturday’s atrocities, the fate of the hostages, both Israeli and foreign, remains unclear. Their relatives’ fears are being exacerbated by Hamas’s threats to kill one hostage for each new Israeli airstrike on civilian targets without warning, and by the prospect of a possible ground offensive.
Hamas has said it is seeking the release of all Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails – approximately 4,500 detainees, according to Israeli human rights group B’Tselem – in exchange for the Israeli hostages. On Monday, the group said the airstrikes had killed four hostages and their captors. According to the health ministry in the Gaza Strip, Israeli attacks have so far killed 1,100 Palestinians and wounded 5,339.
On Wednesday, both the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and Pope Francis urged the immediate release of all the hostages held in Gaza. In the meantime, the families of the kidnapped men, women and children are continuing to hope and to hunt for information.
Ahal Besorai was still waiting for news of his sister and her family, who were at home on the Be’eri kibbutz, a few miles from the Gaza border, when Hamas attacked.
“Should I cry because they are dead already? Should I be happy because maybe they are captured but still alive?” said Besorai, a life coach and resort owner who grew up on the kibbutz but lives in the Philippines. “I pray to God every day that she will be found alive with her family and we can all be reunited.”
Eli Elbag was woken on Saturday by messages from his 18-year-old daughter Liri, who had just begun her military training at the Gaza border. She told her father the militants were shooting at her. Then the messages stopped. By Saturday night, a Hamas video was circulating that showed Liri and others crowded on to a stolen Israeli military truck.
“We are watching television, constantly looking for a sign of her,” said Elbag. “We think about her all the time. All the time wondering if they’re taking caring of her, if they’re feeding her, how she’s feeling and what she’s feeling.”
Yosi Shnaider, a real estate agent in the Israeli city of Holon, was desperate for news after seeing a video of his cousin and her two young boys.
“It’s like an unbelievable bad movie, like a nightmare,” Shnaider said on Monday. “I just need information on if they are alive.”
Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, has said the country is committed to bringing the hostages home and has issued a warning to Hamas, which controls Gaza.
“We demand Hamas not to harm any of the hostages,” he said. “This war crime will not be forgiven.”
Locating and reaching the hostages in Gaza will prove difficult. Although the strip is tiny, subject to constant aerial surveillance and surrounded by Israeli ground and naval forces, the territory just over an hour from Tel Aviv remains somewhat opaque to Israeli intelligence agencies.
Some of the families of the missing are also worried by the remarks made over the weekend by Israel’s influential far-right finance minister, the settler leader Bezalel Smotrich. At a cabinet meeting late on Saturday, Smotrich urged the Israeli army to “hit Hamas brutally and not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration”.
Yotam Kipnis, who is searching for 10 members of his family who have disappeared, including his mother and father, said Smotrich did not speak for all Israelis.
“The finance minister said that he didn’t really care about the hostages as far as the war efforts go,” he said. “But I want the Israeli public and the international public to know that we do care about the hostages. They are families and our friends. They are human beings and we have to do what we can to get them released and to cease the bloodshed as quickly as we can.”
The US president, Joe Biden, confirmed on Tuesday that Americans were among the hostages being held by Hamas and said the US authorities had been instructed to “share intelligence and deploy additional experts from across the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage-recovery efforts”.
Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience to thousands of people in St Peter’s Square on Wednesday, Pope Francis called for the release of all the hostages.
“I continue to follow, with pain and apprehension, what is happening in Israel and Palestine,” he said. “So many people killed, and others wounded. I pray for those families who saw a feast day turn into a day of mourning, and I ask that the hostages be immediately released.”
The pontiff added that although “it is the right of those who are attacked to defend themselves”, he was “very worried by the total siege in which Palestinians live in Gaza, where there have also been many innocent victims”.

Palestinians in Gaza fear impact of siege as sole power plant shuts down,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/palestinians-in-gaza-fear-impact-of-siege-as-sole-power-plant-shuts-down,"Main hospital running low of supplies, many people still trapped under rubble and bombardment continues
As Gaza’s sole power station ran out of fuel amid a tightening siege, hundreds of terrified people sought shelter in the entry of the enclave’s largest hospital, huddling together as bombardments rained down.
“The hospital is completely full and things have started to run low. And this is only day four,” said Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a surgeon at Gaza City’s main hospital, al-Shifa.
“The situation continues to deteriorate, the number of patients, especially kids, that are coming in with horrendous injuries …” he said, his voice trailing off. “This morning there was a child, a young girl, with indescribable facial injuries whose mother is a doctor at al-Shifa who was killed when their home was targeted. Last night, another 10-year-old boy with also devastating facial injuries who was taken out from the rubble of his home in Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood.”
A few hours after the Palestinian minister for energy said Gaza’s only power station had enough fuel to last another 12 hours at most, Gaza’s energy authority said the fuel had run out. The generators that many across Gaza have struggled to keep running in order to power homes and hospitals appeared on the brink of sputtering out without fuel, with no deliveries available due to the closure of Gaza’s southern border crossing with Egypt.
“Soon all services vital for the survival of the population, including hospitals, will no longer function,” said Gaza’s Al Mezan Centre for Human Rights.
The Palestinian Civil Defence, responsible for search and rescue in Gaza, said a large number of people remain trapped under the rubble of their destroyed homes. The organisation said on Tuesday that its rescue workers were unable to retrieve corpses from under the wreckage due to Israeli airstrikes as well as a lack of supplies to be able to carry out search and rescue work.
On Monday Israeli officials promised a “complete siege” of Gaza, after an attack by Hamas militants on Saturday that left more than 1,200 Israelis dead.
The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, ordered a cut to all electricity, water, food and fuel supplies to the enclave, home to more than 2.3 million people, almost half of whom are children. At least 1,100 people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli bombardments, and more than 5,000 wounded.
Dror Sadot, a spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, decried the decision to tighten Israel’s 16-year blockade of Gaza, which had already vastly limited the movement of supplies including food, fuel and building materials, into a total siege. “We are talking about war crimes and collective punishment that Israel is implementing,” she said.
The secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, on Wednesday called for lifesaving supplies including food and water to be allowed in Gaza.
The UN office for humanitarian affairs said at least 260,000 people had fled their homes in the territory.
Rama Abu Amra, a student living in the south of Gaza City, said she had spent the night in fear after warnings that a nearby building would be struck.
“I went through terrifying moments. We knew that the building opposite us was about to be bombed, so me and my family had to leave our home quickly without knowing where we should go,” she said. “When this happened, I didn’t have any internet connection to tell my friends or people around me. I just can’t get what happened out of my head.”
Léo Cans, Médecins Sans Frontières’ head of mission for the Palestinian territories, described the situation in Gaza as “catastrophic”. He said doctors there had lived through multiple previous attacks on the territory, and “they say this time it’s different, that they don’t see a way out and wonder how it’s all going to end … there aren’t words to describe what people are going through.”
Cans added: “Now the Israeli government has decided to completely cut off water and electricity supplies, and the phone network has been badly damaged. This morning, we were unable to reach our teams in Gaza by phone. Inevitably, this all makes it extremely difficult to coordinate rescue operations and access the injured.”
He said medical facilities had not been spared by the relentless bombardments and that one hospital MSF supports was damaged after an airstrike, while a second strike destroyed an ambulance carrying wounded people.
“Medical facilities must be respected. This is not something that should have to be negotiated,” Cans said. The Palestinian Red Crescent said at least four paramedics had been killed in Gaza due to Israeli strikes in one day alone.
Bombardments destroyed entire residential areas, with images showing piles of shattered concrete and rubble.
B’Tselem’s Sadot expressed alarm at news that US officials were discussing brokering a humanitarian corridor rather than increasing pressure on Israeli authorities to cease the bombardments and the siege.
“It’s outrageous, you cannot evacuate 2 million people,” he said. “There’s no way, we’re already talking about hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes. There is no way to bomb such a densely populated area without harm to civilians.”
Mohammed Ghalayini, an air-quality scientist living in Manchester who had returned to Gaza City to visit his family, said he was shocked by the suggestion that Palestinians would have to flee the besieged strip.
“We don’t want more dispossession. I don’t mean to detract from the humanitarian need, but we’ve been putting plasters on humanitarian needs for the past 75 years,” he said.

"All Australians ‘hold you in our hearts’, Anthony Albanese tells Jewish community",2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/11/australians-hold-you-in-our-hearts-anthony-albanese-tells-jewish-community,"Amid rising tensions between supporters of Israel and Palestinians, prime minister says Jewish people will be protected from any antisemitic threat
Anthony Albanese has told Australian Jews that his government is committed to keeping them safe amid rising inter-community tensions after the Hamas attack on Israel and the prospect of all-out war in the Middle East.
As thousands of people gathered in Sydney on Wednesday night to commemorate the deaths of civilians and show support for Israel, the prime minister addressed the Jewish community at St Kilda shule in Melbourne.
He said the targeting of civilians and taking of hostages by Hamas was an affront to all Australians and, as Israel responded by pledging to “obliterate” Hamas in its Gaza stronghold, Albanese acknowledged that many Australian Jews would fear “a rise in antisemitism here at home”.
“I want to assure you, that kind of hateful prejudice has no place in Australia. Our country is better than that – and our country is a better place because of you and your community.
“And my government is committed to keeping the community safe.
“All Australians embrace you in this time of trauma. We hold you in our hearts.”
Albanese said earlier on Wednesday that at least two government-backed Qantas flights would help Australians leave Israel “starting Friday” as the death toll in the region mounts.
Australia’s Jewish community has been on high alert after a cluster of anti-Israeli protests and reports of antisemitic threats.

A pro-Palestinian rally on Monday night saw some attendees chant anti-Jewish rhetoric and light flares while police say they are investigating a handful of threats made against Jewish citizens in Sydney and Melbourne.
Security around Jewish schools and synagogues has been tightened due to fears of potential violence.
A spokesperson for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Alex Ryvchin, said the community was in constant contact with police, the government and private security advisers.
“I want to encourage my people to be proud, to identify as Jews and to deepen their Jewishness at a time when it’s under attack,” he said. “But I know that many in my community worry about the safety of their children and their loved ones.”
A security company run by the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies that patrols community facilities across Sydney has raised its threat level to heightened, believing a terrorist attack could be possible.
Community Security Group Victoria similarly raised its threat level to severe and promised to boost its presence at Jewish schools.

The group said it was aware of a heightened level of fear and anxiety in the community but called for calm.
The New South Wales police deputy commissioner Mal Lanyon acknowledged the anxiety within the Jewish community but stressed the force had increased patrols and there was no immediate risk.
“We would be encouraging parents of students getting into those schools to send their children to school, knowing that the police will be supporting them,” he said.
As the NSW premier, Chris Minns, said a pro-Palestinian rally planned for Sydney on Sunday would not be allowed to go ahead, about 5,000 people descended upon Rodney Reserve in Dover Heights on Wednesday night, many clutching Israeli and Australian flags as well as signs reading “safety is a right” and “united with Israel”.
Jillian Segal, the president of the Executive Council of the Australian Jewry, addressed a solemn crowd, describing the attacks by Hamas as a “date that will live in infamy”.
“Our world has changed, the barbarians have breached the gates,” she said.
“The butchery and savagery that has unfolded in Israel beggars description ... we are totally shattered as we stand together this evening.”
The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, praised Israel for being a “resolute nation” and the Jewish people for their “determination [and] ability to always stuck together”.

Social media urged to act on violent content after Hamas attack,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/11/social-media-urged-to-act-on-violent-content-after-hamas-attack,"UK minister calls urgent meeting as EU criticises X over misleading content such as repurposed historical footage
The coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict on social media platforms has come under scrutiny from the UK government and Brussels, as tech firms including X and Meta were urged to deal with a surge in violent and misleading content on their sites.
In the UK, the technology secretary summoned social media executives on Wednesday to demand the removal from their platforms of violent content related to the Hamas attacks on Israel.
Michelle Donelan called the meeting as the EU criticised X, formerly Twitter, about discussion of the conflict on its platform including fake news and the use of repurposed historical footage.
The EU’s intervention was followed by a demand to Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to make sure it is being “vigilant” about illegal content on its platform after the Hamas raids.
Donelan met executives from X, Google, Meta, TikTok and Snapchat to discuss tackling violent and antisemitic content on their platforms following the Hamas attacks. The technology secretary asked the platforms to set out in writing how they would remove any illegal content or posts that breached their terms and conditions.
“I had a practical conversation with platforms on how they can and must do more to stop supporters of Hamas pushing wicked terrorism and antisemitism to the world. I’ve asked them to follow up and detail the plans they have in writing,” she said.
Thierry Breton, the European commissioner responsible for enforcing sweeping new EU laws governing social media, wrote to Meta soon after issuing a warning to X on the same matter. He gave Mark Zuckerberg’s social media platforms 24 hours to inform him of the steps they were taking to comply with the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA).
“I would ask you to be very vigilant to ensure strict compliance with the DSA rules on terms of service, on the requirement of timely, diligent and objective action following notices of illegal content in the EU, and on the need for proportionate and effective mitigation measures,” Breton told Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, in the letter.
Breton publicised the move on the new social media platform Bluesky, which is championed by the former Twitter owner Jack Dorsey. Violations of the DSA carry the threat of a fine of 6% of global turnover and in the most serious cases a temporary suspension of the service.
The coverage on X has come under scrutiny amid evidence of disinformation related to the war on the platform. On Tuesday, Breton told X’s owner, Elon Musk, his platform was “being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU”.
He added: “I therefore invite you to urgently ensure that your systems are effective, and report on the crisis measures taken to my team.” He also hinted that police agencies had been in touch with X over its content, adding he expected Musk “to be in contact with the relevant law enforcement authorities and Europol” and to “ensure that you respond promptly to their requests”.
Musk replied on X, asking Breton to “list the violations you allude to on X, so that the public can see them”.
Breton responded that it was up to Musk to “demonstrate that you walk the talk” and added that his team was standing by to “enforce rigorously” DSA compliance. It is understood that X is cooperating with the EU’s request to provide information but it will be some time before Brussels takes any further steps.
A Meta spokesperson said the company’s teams were “working around the clock” on coverage related to the attacks, including deploying fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers and working with third-party fact checkers.
“We’ll continue this work as this conflict unfolds,” said the spokesperson.
Media Matters, a US media watchdog, said the attacks represented X’s first test amid a global crisis and that it had “failed spectacularly”, with verified accounts among the sources spreading false information.
The online safety bill, which carries provisions on dealing with illegal and harmful online content, is about to become law in the UK but has yet to receive royal assent.

Former PMs pour cold water on claims Anthony Pratt told them Trump’s US submarine secrets,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/12/former-pms-pour-cold-water-on-claims-anthony-pratt-told-them-trumps-us-submarine-secrets,"A US news report claimed Donald Trump discussed secret US naval capabilities with the billionaire Australian businessman
It was a revelation that could have had explosive ramifications.
US news outlet ABC News reported that an “excited” Donald Trump allegedly discussed top-secret details of US nuclear submarines with the Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt, who later allegedly shared the information with at least 45 people, including “three former Australian prime ministers”.
The details included “the supposed exact number of nuclear warheads [US submarines] routinely carry, and exactly how close they supposedly can get to a Russian submarine without being detected”, according to the ABC News report.
But now, almost all of Australia’s living former prime ministers have denied receiving top-secret information.
John Howard, Malcolm Turnbull, Julia Gillard, Kevin Rudd and Paul Keating have all now ruled themselves out as having such a conversation with Pratt.
Tony Abbott did not definitely rule it out, but told Guardian Australia: “I don’t have any recollection of it.”
Similarly, a spokesperson for Scott Morrison said: “Mr Morrison spoke to Mr Pratt on numerous occasions over the years and does not recall any conversation where Mr Pratt relayed what could be considered sensitive information.”
Guardian Australia is not suggesting the former prime ministers have done anything wrong – Trump has flatly denied the original story.
Citing sources with knowledge of Pratt’s account to investigators for the special counsel Jack Smith, ABC News last week reported that Trump spoke to the Australian businessman at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in April 2021.
ABC News reported that Pratt allegedly brought up the American submarine fleet, which the two had discussed before.
“According to Pratt’s account, as described by the sources, Pratt told Trump he believed Australia should start buying its submarines from the United States, to which an excited Trump – ‘leaning’ toward Pratt as if to be discreet – then told Pratt two pieces of information about US submarines: the supposed exact number of nuclear warheads they routinely carry, and exactly how close they supposedly can get to a Russian submarine without being detected.”

Pratt, the report alleged, went on to share the information with at least 45 people, including his own employees, journalists, foreign and Australian officials “and three former Australian prime ministers”.
It is not clear if what Trump told Pratt was accurate, ABC said. Nevertheless, investigators reportedly asked him to stop repeating what he heard.
Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, late last week that the ABC story was “false and ridiculous … other than the fact that I will often state that we make the best submarines and military equipment anywhere in the world – a pretty well known fact!”
A spokesperson for Keating told Guardian Australia that “in quite a number of discussions he has had with Anthony Pratt, over a range of matters, Mr Pratt had never mentioned submarines or nuclear submarine secrets or anything vaguely near it”.

Gillard’s office confirmed that she “has not received any information from Anthony Pratt about US nuclear submarine capabilities”.
Turnbull said Pratt did not speak to him, although he added: “Trump did ask me in early 2017 why we were buying French rather than US subs.”
Similarly, Howard’s office said he did not have such a conversation with Pratt.
Rudd, who is now the Australian ambassador to the US, said: “I have not spoken to Anthony Pratt about any conversations he may have had with former US President Donald J Trump at Mar-a-Lago in April 2021.”
Morrison was the prime minister at the time of Trump’s alleged disclosure, but negotiated the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan with the Biden administration.
Pratt was asked for a response via his company, Visy Industries.
The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, when asked on Saturday whether Pratt’s comments had reached him, said: “I don’t comment on the security arrangements of another country – that is a matter for the United States.”
Albanese, who is due to travel to the White House in late October, told reporters Australia had “a very good relationship with our friends in the United States”.
But the Greens’ defence spokesperson, David Shoebridge, said the episode should prompt a broader rethink of Australia’s reliance on the US.
“Under the Morrison and Albanese governments, Australia has been tying itself closer and closer to the US,” Shoebridge said.
“With the very real prospect of a future President Trump or worse, we should be seriously considering how this impacts on our national interest.”
Simon Birmingham, who was a senior minister in the Morrison government when it negotiated Aukus with the Biden administration, said he and other members of Australia’s national security committee (NSC) were expected to keep operational details secret “for the rest of our lives”.
Birmingham told Sky News on Friday he could not “prejudge exactly what took place in these discussions” between Trump and Pratt, but observed that US nuclear submarine technologies were highly advanced.
“It’s also why I’m sure many in the United States will take very, very seriously the suggestion that these types of technologies and the capabilities associated with them could be subject to discussions outside of those confined spaces, such as, in our case, the Australian NSC,” Birmingham said.

"IMF sees bleaker economic times ahead for Australia, but the picture’s not all bad | Greg Jericho",2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2023/oct/12/imf-sees-bleaker-economic-times-ahead-for-australia-but-the-pictures-not-all-bad,"Global assessment says country’s in better position this year than forecast six months ago, but revises down growth outlook to a historically bad 1.2%
This week the International Monetary Fund released its latest six-monthly world economic outlook and global financial stability report. As you might imagine with reports that have “world” and “global” in their titles, they cover a wide range of issues, so let’s breakdown what you need to know.
The outlook’s title is “Navigating global divergences”, which is economic-speak for saying things are good in some places and bad in others.
For Australia the story is that this year should be better than the IMF expected back in April, but still worse than it expected a year ago. Meanwhile, next year looks to be a shocker – the IMF has revised GDP growth for 2024 from a projected 1.7% in April down to 1.2%:
If the graph does not display click here
But here’s the thing: 1.7% is already terrible; 1.2% is historically bad. From the end of the 1990s recession to the year before the pandemic, median annual GDP growth was 2.9%. The IMF does not expect us to achieve annual growth greater than 2.3% out to 2028:
If the graph does not display click here
The GDP per capita story is even worse – the IMF projects our economy next year to only increase due to population growth.
Back in April, the IMF thought Australia’s unemployment next year would be 4.1% before rising to 4.7% in 2027. Now it estimates unemployment will be up to 4.3% in 2024 and hit 4.9% in 2028:
If the graph does not display click here
The good news is the IMF is more optimistic about unemployment for this year than it was six months ago, but you can’t predict historically low economic growth in 2024 and not expect that to affect jobs.
We know that the Reserve Bank thinks we need unemployment to rise to 4.5% to get inflation back below 3%, so it is a bit concerning that these new estimates of higher unemployment are not accompanied by new estimates of lower inflation. In fact, the opposite:
If the graph does not display click here
In April the IMF thought inflation would be under 3% by 2025; now it projects that occurring in 2027.
The IMF did report that across the advanced economies “there is scant evidence of a ‘wage-price spiral’ and real wages remain below pre-pandemic levels” and that “company profits have increased robustly over the past two years, with wages having risen more slowly than prices”.
This is expected to reverse over the next few years as workers attempt to recover the lost value of their wages.
But the IMF notes that inflation generally comes down faster when firms and employees adopt a “forward-looking” expectation rather than a backwards-looking one.
That highlights just how tough it will be for workers to regain the value of their wages, when the pressure will be for them to pursue wage growth over the next two years that ignores the past two.
The global financial stability report found that over the past year, house prices in many major economies have declined in real terms (ie that house prices have risen by less than inflation), but these declines – sharp as they may be – have not eroded the big surge in prices since 2019:
If the graph does not display click here
It also found that across the major economies, only the US had bigger interest rate raises than here. But because Australia has more mortgages with variable rates, the impact of rate rises here is much bigger.
One other reason the impact is bigger is that the cost of mortgages relative to income is much bigger here than the other nations the IMF examined:
If the graph does not display click here
There have been a few stories around recently about how China’s economy is struggling and that India is about to overtake China’s population.
This will have an impact on Australia, of course, given China is our biggest trade partner. But we need to pump the brakes on the hot takes suggesting that India is the new global economic wunderkind.
China’s economy over the next four years is still expected to grow at around 4% a year, although this is well down on the 10% average growth during the boom. But India is expected to grow at around only 6% a year over the next few years. Fast, yes, but not China-like (nor even like Japan and Korea after the second world war):
If the graph does not display click here
While India will overtake China as the most populous nation, its economy is much smaller. It might become the third-biggest economy in the world by the end of the decade, but that is still much smaller than China or the United States:
If the graph does not display click here
All of which means that until 2029 at least, the US and China will still drive the global economy:
If the graph does not display click here
But as with all things, this assumes that the predictions come true, and as every IMF outlook shows, even six months can drastically change the outlook, let alone six years.

"‘Menopause market’: Australian women being driven to treat symptoms with unnecessary products, study reveals",2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/12/menopause-market-australian-women-being-driven-to-treat-symptoms-with-unnecessary-products-study-reveals,"Exclusive: New report finds coverage in media and public discussion often not based on strong evidence and overemphasises the severity and frequency of symptoms
There are powerful commercial incentives to “catastrophise” menopause in the minds of Australian women to drive them to purchase products to treat it, a major study into its symptoms has found.
Published on Thursday, the report draws on data from 3,570 women aged 18 and over who took part in the 2023 National Women’s Health Survey who said they had reached menopause.
Co-authored by the Australasian Menopause Society, the Women’s Health Research Program at Monash University and Jean Hailes for Women’s Health, it marks the first time a large, nationally representative survey of Australian women has been conducted to ask about menopause experiences.
The report found that while the severity of symptoms that women attribute to menopause are similar to those published in the medical literature, the proportion of Australian women missing days of work, or taking leave or an extended break from work, is lower than some estimates being used to model and address the impact.

The report noted that while “a substantial minority of women need therapeutic interventions to alleviate menopausal symptoms,” menopause coverage in the media and public discussion was often not based on strong evidence and overemphasised the severity and frequency of symptoms, and the impact.
One example cited by the report was widespread coverage of a study that found “nearly one million” women had quit their jobs in the UK due to lack of employer support for menopause symptoms.
However, the study was later found to be flawed, the report said, based on data from a non-representative sample of women that was then extrapolated and applied to the whole UK population. The study also combined other reasons for leaving the workforce, such as pregnancy and fertility issues, with menopause symptoms.
The Jean Hailes report said: “We caution all parties to avoid ‘catastrophising’ menopause in the framing of public discussions, and particularly in the advertising of goods and services, as it could have the unintended consequences of eroding women’s resilience and stigmatising women as they approach midlife.”
The CEO of Jean Hailes, Dr Sarah White said: “What’s been really increasing is discussion about women affected by menopause symptoms that makes them leave or lose their jobs, or which cause great problems with their relationships or their mental and emotional wellbeing.”
“But the problem is that a lot of the studies of menopause have been conducted through convenience sampling, so they ask women who have already self-identified as having an issue with menopause and then ask those women about their experiences.”
White said while these lived experiences are valuable and should be taken seriously, “there has not been a single survey until this one that takes a random sample of women from across Australia and asks – ‘What’s your experience?’ – to get a nationally representative sample.
“And when you do that, what you find is that actually it’s a small but significant proportion of women who have trouble with menopause and in fact, the majority of women have minor or manageable symptoms. And a small minority have no symptoms at all.”
The report found that 8.7% of Australian women have reached menopause due to surgery or treatment, while 34% have reached menopause naturally.

Of women of reproductive age (18-44) experiencing menopause, 5% of those experiencing bothersome symptoms (including hot flushes, difficulty concentrating and night sweats) in the past five years attributed to menopause found it hard to do daily activities, while 3% missed days of work or study.
A higher proportion of midlife women (age 45 to 64) were affected in the last five years by bothersome symptoms – 26% of this group found it hard to do daily activities, 21% found it hard to work or study, and 15% missed exercise. Fewer than one in ten (7%) Australian midlife women missed days of work or study due to menopause. Meanwhile, 5% of women age over 65 found it hard to do daily activities because of symptoms attributed to menopause.
The report said that further well-conducted research and public reporting of data is critical, “… as an increasing number of commercial organisations and health advocates are moving into a global menopause market that, by some estimates, will be worth more than US$24.4bn by 2030”.
“Unfortunately, there are powerful commercial incentives to create a ‘menopause problem’ in the minds of Australian women and Australian employers that can be ‘fixed’ by the purchase of goods and services,” the report said.
Prof Susan Davis, who is the director of Monash University’s women’s health research program, said 70% of women don’t have severe symptoms of menopause.
“It’s a concern that there are influencers on social media and advertisers recommending a whole lot of stuff for menopause that isn’t necessarily effective or safe,” she said.
“Women are spending a lot of money on stuff that is not going to help them. The majority of over-the-counter, non-hormonal preparations have not been shown to be effective.
“Women need to be very cautious about information on TikTok and other social media. There are medical specialists earning a lot of money spruiking particular products.”
The report recommends women see their GP for evidence-based information, and Davis said women could also turn to the Australasian Menopause Society or Jean Hailes when seeking general information online.
The CEO of the Consumers Health Forum, Dr Elizabeth Deveny, said she is concerned about “an increasing number of commercial players stepping into the health space” and selling health products and services.
“When governments disinvest in health care and health literacy, corporate organisations invest in products and services and market them to you,” she said.
“And it means if people feel desperate for a solution, or they can’t afford to see a GP, but a product slides into their news feed, or into their vision at the supermarket that is easy to access, then people will try it.”

Hamas and Israel at war: what we know on day 5,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/hamas-and-israel-at-war-what-we-know-on-day-5,"Israel Defence Forces hit hundreds of targets in Gaza; reports of ‘massacre’ at Kfar Aza kibbutz
There have been reports of a “massacre” at Kfar Aza kibbutz. Journalists were taken by the Israeli military into the kibbutz, an Israeli community on the frontier with Gaza, where people were killed when Hamas broke through the border on Saturday. Children were among the dead, according to the reports.
At least 30 people have been killed and hundreds wounded as Israel pounded the Gaza Strip with hundreds of airstrikes overnight, a Hamas government official has said.
The most recent update from the Gaza health authority has put the Palestinian death toll in the enclave at 1,055 since Saturday. Among the dead were 260 children and 230 women, it said. The number of wounded was said to be 5,184.
The Israel Defence Forces said they had hit hundreds of targets in Gaza, including 80 in the neighbourhood of Beit Hanon, a city on the north-east edge of Gaza, and more than 450 targets in Al-Furqan neighbourhood. The targets included banks and places the IDF says were used by Hamas to direct attacks against Israel.
More than 260,000 people have fled their homes in the Gaza Strip as heavy Israeli bombardments from the air, land and sea continue to hit the Palestinian enclave, the UN has said.
The sole power station in Gaza has stopped working. Israel cut off its own electricity supply to Gaza on Monday as part of what it called a “complete siege” in response to the Hamas attack.
Israel’s military aim is to destroy Hamas’s military capabilities, a spokesperson has said. Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said Israel’s mission was “to make sure that Hamas, at the end of this war, won’t have any military capabilities by which they can threaten or kill Israeli civilians”.
The death toll in Israel rose by 200 to 1,200. An IDF spokesperson said this rise was “not because there is ongoing fighting”.
The Palestinian envoy to the UN on Tuesday described Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip as “nothing less than genocidal”.
The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, told soldiers “we will come from the ground”, in another clear sign that a ground offensive into Gaza is imminent.
Pope Francis called for the release of all hostages held by Hamas. He said he was very worried by the “total siege” imposed by Israel on Gaza.
Hezbollah said it was responsible for firing precision missiles on Israel on Wednesday, saying it was in response to Israeli attacks this week that left three of its fighters dead.
A spokesperson for Germany’s government said it currently had no valid evidence of Iranian direct involvement in the Hamas attack.
The BBC is reporting that after the weekend’s attack by Hamas, there are 17 dead or missing UK nationals, with children among them. The news site cites an “official UK source”. The previous estimate was “more than 10” British nationals dead or missing.
The French interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said 20 arrests had been made in France over antisemitic acts and threats since the weekend. Visiting a Jewish school in Sarcelles, north of Paris, on Wednesday morning, he said: “It’s important that all French Jewish people know they are protected.”
The US was discussing with Israel and Egypt the idea of a safe passage for Gaza civilians, the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Tuesday.
Fourteen Thai nationals have been taken hostage. Thailand said it received reports that three more of its nationals had been taken hostage in the ongoing violence in Gaza.
Two Palestinians were fatally shot in East Jerusalem by Israeli border police, in a sign of increasing violence that is disproportionately targeting young people across the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

US holds talks on Gaza aid corridor as Israel continues airstrikes,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/gaza-attacks-hamas-israel-war-us-holds-talks-on-safe-passage-civilians,"Israel puts death toll from Hamas attack at 1,200, while Palestinians say 974 killed after Israeli retaliation
The US has discussed brokering an aid corridor for civilians in Gaza as Israel’s air force continued to pound the territory.
The Israeli death toll from an attack by Hamas militants, the deadliest in the country’s history, reached 1,200 people. The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said that 974 people were killed and more than 5,000 wounded after Israeli attacks on the area.
The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Tuesday that talks on safe passage for civilians in Gaza were being held with Israel and Egypt. “We are focused on this question. There are consultations going on. But the details of that are something that are being discussed among the operational agencies and I don’t want to share too much of that publicly at this time.”
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was due to arrive in Israel on Thursday to discuss support in the war, in which 14 Americans have been killed and several taken as hostages.
There have been pleas from humanitarian groups and EU officials for the creation of corridors to allow aid into Gaza and warnings that hospitals overwhelmed with wounded people were running out of supplies. The head of the Palestinian energy authority told local radio on Wednesday morning that Gaza’s sole power plant had only another 12 hours of fuel remaining.
Israeli officials declared a “complete siege” of Gaza days after an attack by Hamas militants on towns bordering the territory. The Gaza Strip is a densely populated area housing more than 2.3 million people, with infrastructure already weakened after a 16-year blockade by Israel and a closure of Gaza’s southern border with Egypt.
The Rafah border crossing into Egypt remained closed, after airstrikes on the area on Tuesday. Egypt routinely shuts the crossing, the only way out for millions of civilians.
Cairo has so far declined to reopen the border to allow safe passage for civilians, despite sending a line of aid trucks to the border before the airstrikes.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said there had been 11 attacks on Gaza healthcare sites in the first 36 hours of the conflict. “There is an urgent need to establish a humanitarian corridor for unimpeded, life-saving patient referrals and movement of humanitarian personnel and essential health supplies,” the WHO said.
On Saturday, the morning of a Jewish holiday, the militant organisation Hamas launched a surprise attack from the Gaza Strip, with gunmen crossing the border, raiding Israeli cities and gunning down civilians in their homes, cars and at a desert music festival. As many as 150 hostages are believed to have been taken.
Amid mounting expectations that Israel will launch a ground invasion of Gaza within days, the air force continued to batter the enclave with deadly strikes late on Tuesday, using dozens of fighter jets to hit more than 70 targets, according to Israeli military officials.
Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, a spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), said on Wednesday morning that 300,000 reservists had been sent south, close to Gaza, and were getting ready “to execute the mission we have been given by the Israeli government … to make sure that Hamas, at the end of this war, won’t have any military capabilities by which they can threaten or kill Israeli civilians”.
In Gaza’s al-Rimal neighbourhood, Palestinian civil defence forces pulled Abdullah Musleh out of his basement together with 30 others after their apartment building was flattened. “I sell toys, not missiles,” the 46-year-old said, weeping. “I want to leave Gaza. Why do I have to stay here? I lost my home and my job.”
The Israeli military has issued warnings to civilians to evacuate whole neighbourhoods before inflicting devastation, although Palestinian residents of Gaza say they are forced to flee with no safe place to run to.
The UN humanitarian agency OCHA described a “mass displacement,” in the Gaza Strip, with more than 263,000 people fleeing their homes. It said that number was expected to rise further.
On Tuesday, the military told residents of the al-Daraj neighbourhood to evacuate. New explosions soon rocked it and other areas, continuing into the night.
One blast hit Gaza City’s seaport, setting fishing boats aflame. “There is no safe place in Gaza right now. You see decent people being killed every day,” the Gaza journalist Hasan Jabar said after three Palestinian journalists were killed in the bombardments in Al Rimal. “I am genuinely afraid for my life.”
Sporadic fighting continued in southern Israel on Tuesday night, with a group of militants entering an industrial zone in Ashkelon, sparking a gun battle with Israeli troops, the military said. Three militants were killed, and troops were searching the area for others.
In East Jerusalem, the Israeli police said they shot and killed two Palestinians who had thrown fireworks at security forces in the Silwan neighbourhood.
There is rising concern about an increasing use of live fire by Israeli forces at checkpoints and during clashes with Palestinian young people across the West Bank. The organisation Defense for Children Palestine, which documents harm to children across the occupied Palestinian territories, said before the shooting in East Jerusalem it had recorded at least five separate incidents of children being shot and killed on the West Bank, all with gunshot wounds to their abdomen, chest, or head.
The Israeli military spokesperson Conricus said early on Wednesday that the Israeli death toll since Saturday stood at 1,200, with more than 2,700 wounded. The already “unimaginable” figure would increase, he said, with the overwhelming majority of the dead civilians. The rising numbers were the result of new discoveries of victims rather than fresh fighting, he said.
Conricus added that Israeli forces had regained control in the south and rebuilt the barriers along the border that Hamas breached to launch Saturday’s attack.
About 150 people are believed to be held captive by militants in Gaza, with Hamas threatening to start executing its hostages if Israel carries out airstrikes on civilians without giving “prior warning”.
Israel said on Tuesday that it had recovered the bodies of more than 1,500 Hamas fighters inside Israel, giving the clearest indication yet of the scale of the weekend’s assault.

"Hamas gunmen ‘killed families in their beds’ at Kfar Aza kibbutz, say Israeli forces ",2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/hamas-attack-kfar-aza-kibbutz-massacre-israel,"Grim scene of ‘massacre’ at one of the first Israeli communities reached by militants during assault
In Kfar Aza, no one was too old, too young or too weak for slaughter. It took the Israeli army half a day to reach the kibbutz of 750 people in southern Israel and fighting continued there for three days. In that time Hamas gunmen killed and mutilated dozens of civilian residents.
“Mothers, fathers, babies, young families killed in their beds, in the protection room, in the dining room, in their garden,” Maj Gen Itai Veruv of the Israel Defence Forces told the BBC, as his troops searched homes for bodies of victims. “It’s not a war, it’s not a battlefield. It’s a massacre.”
The kibbutz was one of the first Israeli communities reached by Hamas militants when they launched an assault early on Saturday morning. What happened there has echoes of accounts from the nearby Nahal Oz kibbutz, where entire families are believed to have been gunned down, and Be’eri kibbutz, where Israeli rescue teams say they have found more than 100 bodies.
The community in Kfar Aza had a security team, and houses had safe rooms, but they – like the highest echelons of the Israeli army and government – were not prepared for the wave of attackers racing out of the breached Gaza.
Rampaging fighters armed with assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and hand-grenades gunned down dozens of residents and mutilated some of the bodies, Veruv and other soldiers said, describing a number of atrocities.
“They killed them and cut some of their heads, it’s a dreadful thing to see,” Davidi Ben Zion, the deputy commander of Unit 71, the paratroopers who led the Israeli forces into Kfar Aza, told Reuters.
“Thank God we saved many lives of many parents and children,” he said. “Unfortunately, some were burned by molotov [cocktails]. They are very aggressive, like animals.”
The attack was so rapid that milk and coffee from Saturday’s breakfast still sat on the table of one home visited by a journalist from the Washington Post, beside a kitchen floor smeared with blood.
Outside, rows of once tidy streets lined with palm trees and banana plants were shrouded by the smell of death, and disfigured by the wreckage of war.
Bodies lay in gardens where they had fallen, the victims so numerous that the mortuary teams needed hours to collect them all. Homes were pockmarked with signs of fighting, and some reduced to rubble, and beside them were scattered torched cars and piles of broken furniture.
Israeli soldiers who combed slowly through the village on Tuesday warned visiting journalists to stay out of homes that had not been cleared, warning they could be booby-trapped with explosives.
The wreckage of a paraglider used to fly over Israeli defences lay beside one path, along with motorcycles that carried other militants out of Gaza, the BBC reported.
In a speech on Tuesday evening, the US president, Joe Biden, said the attack by Hamas, which has killed at least 1,000 people, “brings to mind the worst rampages” of Islamic State.
More than 900 people in Gaza have been killed in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes while enforcing a blockade that sealed off the besieged territory of 2.3 million people from food, fuel and other supplies.
 This article’s subheading was amended on 11 October 2023 to remove a reference to Kfar Aza as a “settlement”.

Biden condemns Hamas for ‘act of sheer evil’ and says US citizens taken hostage,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/10/biden-hamas-hostages-israel-gaza,"President in TV speech says Hamas does not represent ‘legitimate aspirations’ of Palestinian people and says US ‘stands with Israel’
Joe Biden on Tuesday pledged unflinching support for Israel, calling the assault by Hamas militants that left nearly 1,000 people dead an “act of sheer evil” and confirming that some US citizens are part of the many currently being held hostage.
In a televised speech from the White House, the US president said at least 14 Americans were killed in last weekend’s attack by Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls Gaza, and a yet unknown number of Americans are being held hostage.
The attack saw gunmen crossing the border from Gaza, raiding Israeli cities and gunning down civilians in their homes, cars and at a desert music festival. As many as 150 hostages are believed to have been taken. More than 900 people in Gaza have been killed in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes while enforcing a “blockade” that sealed off the besieged territory of 2.3 million people from food, fuel and other supplies.
Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, later told reporters that “20 or more Americans” were unaccounted for following the weekend violence, though the number held captive by Hamas remains unclear. He said the US government was in regular contact with the families of the missing, some of whom have made public pleas to US and Israeli authorities for help locating their loved ones.
“In this moment, we must be crystal clear: we stand with Israel,” Biden, flanked by vice-president Kamala Harris and US secretary of state Antony Blinken, said in a forceful speech, repeating: “We stand with Israel.”
In a show of solidarity with Israel, the state department announced on Tuesday that Blinken will travel to Israel in the coming days.
In his remarks from the White House State Dining Room, Biden was unequivocal in his condemnation of Hamas, calling it a terrorist organization whose “state purpose is the annihilation of the state of Israel and the murder of Jewish people”.
“Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self-determination,” he added, echoing the sentiment expressed in a rare joint statement by the leaders of the US, UK, France, Germany and Italy on Monday night.
“All of us recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,” it said. “But make no mistake: Hamas does not represent those aspirations, and it offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed.”
On Tuesday, Biden said the group’s attack “brings to mind the worst rampages of Isis.”
“Parents butchered, using their bodies to try to protect their children. Stomach churning reports of babies being killed … women raped, assaulted, paraded as trophies,” he said. “This is terrorism.”
As Israeli warplanes pounded the Gaza Strip after the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu vowed “mighty vengeance” against Hamas, the Biden made no public appeals for restraint.
Israel, he said, not only had the right to defend itself but a “duty” to do so. But in a phone call prior to his remarks, Biden said he reminded Netanyahu that democracies were more secure when they act “according to the rule of law”.
Biden said the US was committed to supporting its ally and was “surging” additional military assistance to replenish its Iron Dome rocket interceptor system. The US Congress, presently plunged into chaos without a House speaker, may also be asked to take “urgent action” on the matter, Biden said.
In Washington, the attack has largely drawn a similar response from lawmakers across the ideological spectrum, with condemnations of Hamas and expressions of solidarity with Israel.
In a statement, the Senate leader Chuck Schumer, the highest ranking Jewish official in American history, said he spoke on Tuesday with Israel’s president Isaac Herzog and assured him that a bipartisan group in the US Senate “stands ready to do whatever it takes to ensure Israel has the resources it needs”.
Still, there were voices of dissent. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat from Michigan and the first Palestinian American woman elected to serve in Congress said in a statement: “I grieve the Palestinian and Israeli lives lost.”
She also called on Israel to commit to “lifting the blockade, ending the occupation and dismantling the apartheid system that creates the suffocating, dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance”.
She concluded: “As long as our country provides billions in unconditional funding to support the apartheid government, this heartbreaking cycle of violence will continue.”
Speaking to reporters, Sullivan said the US would support Israel “for as long as they need” and additional military assistance, including shipments of ammunition and other weapons, was on its way. “You can expect American planes flying into Israel to deliver military capabilities,” he said.
Asked what the US was doing for Palestinian civilians trying to flee the Israeli bombardment, Sullivan said the US was “focused on this question” and was actively working with Israel and neighboring Egypt to identify a route for residents of Gaza to escape.
Domestically, Biden said in his remarks that state and federal law enforcement agencies were also responding by taking steps to safeguard Jewish centers across the country and “disrupt any domestic threat that could emerge in connection to these horrific attacks”.
Biden is a staunch ally of Israel, stretching back to his first visit to the country as a young US senator in 1973. In his remarks on Tuesday, Biden recalled that visit, 50 years ago, recounting a lengthy conversation he had with then Israeli prime minister Golda Meir in the weeks leading up to the Yom Kippur war.
He said Meir, sensing his concern for the fate of Israel, sought to assure him. “Don’t worry, Senator Biden, we have a secret weapon,” she whispered, according to Biden. “We have no place else to go.”

Over 260,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in the Gaza Strip, as heavy Israeli bombardments from the air, land and sea continue to hit the Palestinian enclave, the United Nations said.
Fierce fighting has left thousands dead on both sides since Hamas launched a surprise assault on Saturday, spurring Israel’s reprisal bombing campaign.
“Over 263,934 people in Gaza are believed to have fled their homes,” said UN humanitarian agency OCHA said in an update Tuesday, warning that “this number is expected to rise further”.
It said that around 3,000 people had been displaced “due to previous escalations”, prior to Saturday.
In a televised speech on Tuesday, US president Joe Biden said Hamas does not represent the “legitimate aspirations” of Palestinian people and says the US “stands with Israel”. Confirming that some US citizens are part of the many currently being held hostage, Joe Biden called the assault by Hamas militants that more than 1,200 people dead an “act of sheer evil”.
Michael Oren, the Israeli ambassador to the US from 2009-2013, told the BBC he had never seen a speech as unequivocal in its support for Israel.
“I have never heard a speech like President Biden just gave at the White House,” he said.

The death toll in Israel now stands at more than 1,200 people, most of whom were civilians, Kan, the public broadcaster, reports.
It is an increase of 200 people since the last toll was confirmed.
The Gaza health authority has put the death toll in the enclave at 900 since Saturday.
A flight carrying 192 South Koreans from Tel Aviv has arrived at Incheon Airport South Korea, Reuters reports.
570 South Koreans are estimated to be staying long-term in Israel while around 230 are staying short-term, according to South Korea’s foreign ministry on Wednesday.The Ben Gurion Airport was “crowded” and “hectic,” said Jang Jeong-yoon, a 62-year-old who was on board the Korean Air flight home after travelling to Israel to take part in the festival of Sukkot.“As flights were cancelled or delayed, there was fear and people were rushing to leave the country,” she said.
Some relatives of those on board the plane were seen waiting at Incheon Airport early Wednesday morning.Around 60 South Koreans who were visiting Israel moved to Jordan on Tuesday, according to the foreign ministry.No South Korean casualties had been reported, foreign minister Park Jin said on Tuesday. Many of the short-term South Koreans travellers were visiting the country for a pilgrimage.Korean Air has cancelled flights departing from Incheon to Tel Aviv on Monday and Wednesday and expects future flights to be irregular.
The US is talking with Israel and Egypt about the idea of a safe passage for Gaza civilians as Israel strikes the enclave after a deadly Hamas attack over the weekend, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday.“We are focused on this question, there are consultations going on,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.“But the details of that are something that are being discussed among the operational agencies and I don’t want to share too much of that publicly at this time,” Sullivan said.
“We do not deliberately target civilians,” Sullivan said of the US and Israel, when asked about civilian casualties in Gaza in the Tuesday press briefing.“We work to make sure that our military operations are conducted consistent with the rule of law and the law of war,” he added.Gaza’s Health Ministry said at least 900 Palestinians were killed and up to 4,600 wounded in Israeli air strikes on the blockaded enclave since Saturday. Gaza is 40km (25 miles) long by 10km (6 miles) wide and is home to 2.3 million people.
More now in Israel’s exchanges of fire with Syria, via AFP:
Israel’s military on Tuesday said it had responded with artillery fire from the Golan Heights after munitions were launched toward territory it has occupied since 1967.
“Soldiers are responding with artillery and mortar shells toward the origin of the launching in Syria,” an Israeli military statement said, on the fourth day of a war with Gaza-based Hamas militants that has sent regional tensions soaring.
The military said there had been “a number of launches from Syria into Israeli territory”.
A military spokesman told AFP it appeared to have been mortar fire.
This was the first exchange of fire between Israel and Syria since Hamas carried out an unprecedented assault on Israeli territory from the blockaded Gaza Strip on Saturday.
Fears of another front opening in the conflict have grown after days of clashes with militants on the northern border with Lebanon.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based NGO with an extensive network of sources in Syria, the shells were fired by “Palestinian factions working with the Lebanese Hezbollah”.
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the Six-Day War of 1967. Its 1981 annexation of the strategic area is not recognised by the United Nations.
The South China Morning Post reports that 28 Hong Kong residents have asked for help getting home from Israel, and that 16 have managed to leave. The rest face uncertainty amid cancelled flights, in particular from Cathay Pacific.
“The news came as flagship carrier Cathay Pacific Airways cancelled flights from Hong Kong to Israel’s Tel Aviv on Tuesday and Thursday and the Immigration Department said it had already handled 28 requests for help as of 5pm,” the SCMP reports, as “Cathay Pacific said it would decide on Friday about flights on Sunday to Tel Aviv”.
There are indirect flights available for now, according to SCMP.
Meanwhile Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US carriers, said on Tuesday it remains in discussions with government agencies about flying between America and Israel, both to repatriate American citizens and to bring Israeli reservists back. “The situation in Israel is rapidly evolving, and our carriers continue to make individual assessments about operations based on security guidance and intelligence reports,” a spokesperson told Reuters.
Israel faces the threat of a multi-front war after clashes with Syria and Lebanon, Agence France-Presse reports.
On Tuesday, for the first time since the Hamas attack, there was an exchange of fire between Israel and forces in Syria, after Israel’s military said munitions were fired towards the Golan Heights it has occupied since 1967.
There have also been three days of clashes with militants on the northern Israeli border with Lebanon.
On Tuesday, mourners in the southern Lebanese village of Khirbet Selm carried two caskets, draped in yellow Hezbollah flags, with the bodies of two fighters it said were killed in Israeli strikes a day earlier. A third fighter was also killed, the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement said.
Israeli officials said a senior Israel Defence Forces officer and two soldiers were killed in a clash with gunmen who entered Israel from Lebanon on Monday afternoon. The Israeli army said no Israeli injuries were reported in Tuesday’s clashes with Hezbollah.
On Tuesday, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades claimed a fresh salvo of rocket fire from south Lebanon towards Israel, the Israeli army said, adding it retaliated with artillery fire.
Two Filipino nationals have been killed following Hamas’ assault on Israel, the Philippines Secretary for Foreign Affairs Enrique A. Manalo has said.
In a statement posted on social media, he said: “The Philippines condemns the killing of two Filipino nationals and all other acts of terrorism and violence as a result of Hamas actions against Israel. The Philippines is ready to work with other countries towards a long-lasting resolution to the conflict, in accordance with pertinent UN Security Council Resolutions and the general principles of international law. The Philippine government will continue to provide all possible assistance to distressed Filipinos nationals in Israel and Palestine.”
Just a note to say that I am not entirely sure, but I as far as I can tell, Darje Tupah, the neighbourhood mentioned by the Israeli Air Force, is a mistranslation of al-Daraj, the name of the Gaza neighbourhood. If you happen to know, please get in touch: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com.
The Israeli Air Force has announced that fighter jets hit 70 targets in “Darje Tupah”, or or al-Daraj, Gaza, on Tuesday night. They said Hamas had directed attacks against Israel from the neighbourhood.
“Dozens of IAF fighter jets attacked more than 70 targets throughout Darje Tupah in Gaza tonight. The Darje Tupah area serves as a terrorist nest for the terrorist organisation Hamas and from where many activities against Israel are carried out,” the Air Force wrote.
Israeli strikes hit homes in Gaza City and the southern city of Khan Younis on Tuesday, Hamas-affiliated media said.
A strike on a home in Gaza City’s Sabra neighbourhood killed five people, according to a medical official who spoke to Reuters.Residents appealing for help on social media said many buildings had collapsed, sometimes trapping as many as 50 people inside with rescue workers unable to reach them.The United Nations said more than 180,000 Gazans had been made homeless, many huddling on streets or in schools.
At the morgue in Gaza’s Khan Younis hospital on Tuesday, bodies lay on the ground on stretchers with names written on their torsoes, Reuters reports. Medics called for relatives to pick up bodies quickly because there was no more space for the dead.A municipal building was hit while being used as an emergency shelter. Survivors there spoke of many dead.“No place is safe in Gaza, as you see they hit everywhere,” Ala Abu Tair, 35, who had sought shelter there with his family after fleeing Abassan Al-Kabira near the border.
Israel’s military said its forces, backed by a helicopter and drones, clashed with militants inside Israeli territory late on Tuesday, Reuters reports. Soldiers killed three militants in the incident in Ashkelon, starting a fire in an industrial area close to an oil terminal located just over 10 km (6 miles) from the Gaza Strip that has been shut in the wake of the attacks, it said.

I thought it would probably have been the easiest text they were assigned and I’ve had a few messages from students saying that was the case ... makes me pleased to know most of the students would’ve read it and gone ‘oh, this is the part where you can get the easiest marks’.
Robertson said she didn’t know how HSC exams were graded in 2023 but wished all students the best, adding: “I’d like to tell them that whatever their interpretation of my piece was, as the author I confirm that it’s valid.”

Woman suing Qatar Airways ‘very disappointed’ with inquiry report
One of the Australian women taking legal action against Qatar Airways has blasted a Senate inquiry report examining the government’s decision to block the airline from launching extra flights to Australia.
Anna, one of the five women who are taking legal action over a 2020 incident at Doha airport where female passengers were forced from planes by gunpoint and subject to non-consensual invasive bodily inspections as authorities searched for the mother of a baby abandoned in a bathroom, said she and the other women “are very disappointed” with the Senate inquiry report released on Monday.
It fails to hold Qatar Airways to account for its handling of the horrific incident that we were subjected to on a Qatar Airways flight in October 2020. We agree with the finding of Labor’s dissenting report that Qatar Airways is not a good corporate citizen and is not entitled to improved landing rights.
Our experience of Qatar Airways and the state of Qatar is that they have ignored our complaints and have aggressively defended the court proceedings we’ve been forced to commence.
The Senate inquiry report recommended the Albanese government should immediately review its decision to block Qatar Airways from launching extra flights to Australia, as it called for a significantly expanded role and powers for the competition and consumer watchdog in the sector.
The report underscored just how politically charged the saga has become. While senators agreed on a range of recommendations aimed at stamping out anti-competitive behaviour by larger airlines, better considering consumers in government decisions and reducing strategic cancellations at Sydney airport, Labor and Greens senators issued dissenting reports.
The Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie, chair of the committee, accused the Albanese government of obstructing the inquiry from accessing evidence and gagging department officials, while transport minister Catherine King called the inquiry a “political stunt”.

Coalition welcomes release and safe return of Cheng Lei
The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, and the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Simon Birmingham, have issued a joint statement welcoming the release and safe return back to Australia of Cheng Lei.
Ms Cheng’s release and return home to her children and partner Nick Coyle will be a moment of great relief and joy to them. We thank all of those who have worked tirelessly over three years to secure this outcome and acknowledge everyone who has advocated for Ms Cheng’s release. Particular acknowledgement is owed to Australia’s ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher, along with many Dfat officers and consular officials.
We also acknowledge the government’s efforts to continue the work of former foreign minister Marise Payne to secure Ms Cheng’s release and their provision of regular confidential briefings to the opposition on the situation. After three years of uncertainty, secrecy and zero transparency we are thankful this painful episode for Ms Cheng and her family has come to a welcome end.
The opposition remains deeply concerned for Australian Dr Yang Hengjun, who continues to be detained in China, and urges the Albanese government to use all available diplomatic means to equally secure his return and to ensure his wellbeing.
Doctors’ group says living wonders judgment sets ‘dangerous’ precedent
Earlier on the blog we brought you the news that the federal court dismissed a legal challenge to decisions made by the environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, in relation to two proposed coalmine expansions.
Known as the living wonders case, the legal action launched by the Environment Council of Central Queensland (ECoCeQ) alleged the minister failed to protect the environment from climate harm when she decided the projects could move to the next stage of the federal assessment process.
Doctors for the Environment says the dismissal of the challenge sets a “dangerous, short-sighted precedent”.
The court has decided that our govt does not have to consider climate in coal and gas approvals. A dangerous short sighted precedent. Let’s be clear, every coal and gas project adds to global heating and climate breakdown @EDOLawyers #Auspol https://t.co/jzLcmMqrZG
Organisers of a pro-Palestine protest say an upcoming rally in Sydney will go ahead despite police and the state’s premier rejecting their plan to take to the streets, AAP reports.
Police launched a task force to co-ordinate responses to protest activity across NSW after a widely condemned rally on the steps of the Sydney Opera House.
The rally on Monday night was held as the NSW government lit the iconic venue in the blue and white of the Israeli flag in solidarity with victims of terrorist attacks by Islamist group Hamas.
Some attendees chanted anti-Jewish rhetoric and lit flares, actions denounced by rally organisers Palestine Action Group.
Organiser Josh Lees told AAP a planned Sunday rally at Town Hall would still go ahead despite police saying it was unauthorised.
We’re very confident Sunday will be a peaceful protest [and] we’ve made it clear those racist views are not welcome.

Protesters scale Sheffield town hall to remove Israeli flag,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/11/protesters-scale-sheffield-town-hall-remove-israeli-flag,"Council begins security review after incident during pro-Palestine rally in city centre
A security review is under way after a protester removed an Israeli flag from Sheffield town hall during a pro-Palestine rally in the city.
Footage posted on social media showed two people scaling the 60-metre (200ft) tall building during a demonstration on Tuesday evening.
The flag is seen to be thrown from the landmark Victorian building and replaced with the Palestinian flag, to cheers from those gathered below.
Reports that the Israeli flag was destroyed were not true, according to a Sheffield city council spokesperson who said it was handed back to officials from the local authority.
The council leader, Tom Hunt, said: “Everyone has the right to safe and peaceful protest but we cannot support the events that took place during the protest outside Sheffield’s town hall.
“Protesters put themselves and others in serious danger. We are a city of sanctuary, and this is not what we stand for.”
Hunt added: “There are strong feelings about the situation in Israel and Palestine but we ask everyone to show respect and tolerance at this time. Our thoughts are with all those affected, including here in the UK.
“Terrorism is never justified. We call for peace and an end to attacks on innocent men, women and children in Israel and Palestine.”
South Yorkshire police have appealed for help identifying the two men involved in the incident, which it said took place shortly after 6pm.
The force said “minor disorder” led to the two suspects fleeing the scene when officers attempted to disperse the crowds.
Sheffield city council said a union flag was hoisted at 8pm, a move it said was planned before the incident.
The spokesperson said the council had displayed the Israeli flag to show solidarity.
She said the decision was taken in accordance with the authority’s flag protocol and in response a request from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities to consider doing it.
The spokesperson said a full review of the incident had begun, including an examination of security measures
South Yorkshire police have been contacted for comment.

England’s Jewish schools heighten security as antisemitic incidents quadruple,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/oct/11/englands-jewish-schools-take-extra-security-precautions,"CST says incidents are up 324% on last year, with schools increasing security patrols after attacks in Israel
Jewish schools across England are taking extra precautions to protect their staff and students after the attack on Israel, as the body that provides security advice to Jewish communities in the UK said it had recorded 89 antisemitic incidents between Saturday and Tuesday.
Extra security patrols have been posted at school gates, and trips and after-school detentions have been cancelled.
Several schools said they had carried out “invacuation” drills, where pupils practise sheltering in safe areas or reinforced rooms in the event of a threat. Pupils have been told to avoid wearing identifying school uniform on public transport.
The Community Security Trust reported that the number of antisemitic incidents in the four days from Saturday morning had increased by 324% compared with the same period last year.
“This is a provisional total that is almost certain to increase further as we receive more delayed reports of incidents covering this period, and while we continue to verify and log all the reports that we have currently received,” the CST said.
“Make no mistake: these are anti-Jewish racist incidents and hate crimes in which Jewish people, property and institutions are singled out for hate, including death threats and abuse.
“In many cases, the perpetrators of these disgraceful incidents are using the symbols and language of pro-Palestinian politics as rhetorical weapons with which to threaten and abuse Jewish people.”
The 89 incidents included six assaults, three cases of damage to Jewish property, 14 direct threats and 66 cases of abusive behaviour, including verbal abuse, graffiti, hate mail and online abuse.
Among the examples given by the CST was an Orthodox Jewish man on a London bus being hit in the face by a man who tried to take his religious hat. A Jewish person walking to a synagogue in London was called “dirty Jew” by a stranger, who said “no wonder you’re all getting raped”.
Graffiti reading “From the river to the sea Palestine will be free” was daubed on the former home of a rabbi in Nottingham. A group of children in a school blamed a Jewish pupil for the killing of Palestinians.
Most of the incidents took place in London and Greater Manchester.
The CST has recorded spikes in the number of antisemitic incidents during previous conflicts involving Israel and Gaza. In May 2021, it recorded 70 incidents in the first four days, and in July 2014, 29 were noted.
John Dalziel, the headteacher of King David high school in Manchester, said there was a drop in attendance on Monday as parents kept their children at home but numbers had since risen.
“We have 800 Jewish students at this school and almost all of them have family and relatives there who have been affected directly or indirectly,” Dalziel said. “Our main priority is that our school is a place of safety where normal life is continuing away from the 24-hour news cycle.”
Dalziel said Greater Manchester police and the CST had increased their patrols around the school, while trained parent volunteers had been in place, especially at the start and end of the day, to reassure parents.
The school has also held assemblies to discuss the attacks, sharing examples of resilience and kindness. Pupils have been given lessons on online safety, stressing the need to be aware of social media disinformation and graphic images.
The highly visible ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Stamford Hill, north-east London, said the aftermath of the atrocities in Israel had “regrettably seen a rise in hate crimes in the UK, which is a cause for extreme concern.
“We commend the police for their increased patrols and reassurances, which play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of our community.”
Edward Daniel, the spokesperson of the Union of Jewish Students (UJS), said the group was working with CST’s security team and assessing university Jewish events “on a case-by-case basis”.
Daniel said: “UJS held a briefing for Jewish student leaders on Monday to advise them how to safely proceed with events during this crisis. While there sadly is a need for Jewish students to be more vigilant of their personal security, UJS maintains that university campuses are safe for them to attend, and our team are available to support them.”
Pupils have been told they can take off blazers and ties while travelling on public transport, as have students attending JFS in north London, Europe’s largest Jewish school, which has about 2,000 pupils.
“The most important thing is to ensure the safe passage of students between home and school and to make sure that this school is set up to care for our children during the school day,” JFS’s headteacher, David Moody, said in an email to parents.
A former JFS pupil, Nathanel Young, who was serving in the Israel Defence Forces, was killed on the Gaza border on Saturday. Another former pupil, Jake Marlowe – who had been missing while providing security at a music festival near the Re’im kibbutz close to the border – has been found dead, his family confirmed on Wednesday.
The Jewish community secondary school in Barnet, north London, has introduced extra checks on people entering its site. Melanie Lee, the headteacher, told parents: “There will be heightened vigilance, an increase in the numbers of our own school security team and also enhanced security checks at entry points into the school.”
Broughton Jewish Cassel Fox primary school in Salford is among those that have cancelled school trips and put extra security in place during the school day.
Suella Braverman has urged chief constables to clamp down on any attempts to use flags, songs or swastikas to harass or intimidate members of the Jewish community. Chanting and the waving of a Palestinian flag could be offences, the home secretary said.
Within hours of the attack, the Metropolitan police said they had increased patrols in London “in order to provide a visible presence and reassurance to our communities”.
On Tuesday evening, two protesters scaled Sheffield town hall to replace an Israeli flag flying at half-mast with a Palestinian flag.

‘I fear the worst’: Israeli man waits for news of 10 relatives caught in kibbutz attack,2023-10-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/israeli-man-waits-for-news-of-10-relatives-caught-in-beeri-kibbutz-attack,"Yotam Kipnis does not know if his parents and other family members were killed or taken hostage in Be’eri kibbutz assault
Yotam Kipnis hasn’t heard from his parents since 8.30am on Saturday, when he rang his mother and she told him they were hiding inside the shelter of their home on the Be’eri kibbutz and could hear gunfire outside.
“I tried to call her again at 10 o’clock and she didn’t answer,” said Kipnis, 29, a human rights worker who grew up on the kibbutz in southern Israel, four miles (6.5km) from the Gaza border.
“But I’ve heard from other relatives and friends of the family that they spoke to her around 9.30am and she told them that someone was entering the shelter. They heard shouting down the phone. I haven’t been able to contact my parents since then.”
Although more than 100 bodies have been recovered from the kibbutz in the aftermath of the murderous attack by Hamas gunmen, Yotam said his mother and father, Lilach, 60, and Eviatar, 65, had yet to be found.
Eight other members of the family are also missing from the kibbutz: Lilach’s sister Shoshan Haran; her husband, Avshalom Haran; their daughter Adi Shoham; her partner, Tal Shoham; their two children, Naveh and Yahel Shoham, who are eight and three; Avshalom’s sister Sharon Avigdori; and her daughter Noam Avigdori. Paul Vincent Castelvi, a carer who looks after Eviatar, who has an auto-immune condition, has also disappeared.
“I fear the worst, but they may still be alive and may be being held hostage,” said Kipnis. “I don’t know where anyone is or whether my father has been separated from his carer. I want people to know about the situation of the hostages in Gaza and I want the situation to end as quickly as possible with the lowest number of casualties and the least damage.”
Kipnis has contacted the Red Cross and human rights groups but has yet to receive any news about his loved ones.
Adding to his uncertainty and worry are comments made over the weekend by Israel’s influential far-right finance minister, the settler leader Bezalel Smotrich. At a cabinet meeting late on Saturday, Smotrich – who has previously said “there is no such thing as a Palestinian nation” – urged the Israeli army to “hit Hamas brutally and not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration”.
Kipnis said Smotrich did not speak for all Israelis. “The finance minister said that he didn’t really care about the hostages as far as the war efforts go,” he said. “But I want the Israeli public and the international public to know that we do care about the hostages. They are families and our friends. They are human beings and we have to do what we can to get them released and to cease the bloodshed as quickly as we can.”
Things were bad enough as they were, Kipnis said. “I’ve already lost many of my friends and loved ones in this war.”
He said he wanted to see an end to the “fundamentalist” Hamas and to the current Israeli government, which he described as a “dysfunctional, far-right [administration] that doesn’t represent its citizens in any way … It feels like we’ve been abandoned by our government in order for them to fulfil some messianic urges.”
Kipnis also said those on the Be’eri kibbutz had long feared an atrocity on Saturday’s scale. “A friend of mine used to say that our lives on the kibbutzim are 95% heaven and 5% hell,” he said. “That was because of the wars and the operations over the years.”
Missile attacks from Gaza had become “a sort of once-a-year situation” that had led the kibbutz’s 1,000 residents to evacuate, he said. And then there was the threat of the tunnels that would allow Hamas to launch cross-border raids.
He said the nagging fear that something big and terrible was on its way had only increased in recent years.
“We felt that this would blow up eventually, especially in the past few years and specifically in the past year, when the army was focused on protecting settlers rather than protecting our part of the state, the Negev, even though defence is actually the mission of the Israeli defence forces.”

US to send more arms to Israel before expected Gaza invasion,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/12/us-to-send-more-arms-to-israel-before-expected-gaza-invasion,"Ground forces are gathering near the border, as UN says that Gaza is dangerously close to running out of food and water
The US pledged to send more arms to Israel on Thursday ahead of an expected ground assault in Gaza against Hamas, as the UN warned food and water supplies were running dangerously low in the blockaded enclave.
As America’s top diplomat flew into Israel following Saturday’s surprise cross-border assault by Hamas, the UK announced it would send two navy ships and would begin surveillance flights in its own show of support.
Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, pledged his country’s support for Israel “today, tomorrow, every day”.He told the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on a visit to the region that Israel “may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself but, as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to. We will always be there by your side”.
The declaration of solidarity came as Israeli troops continued to build close to Gaza before an expected ground invasion. Intense bombing of the narrow territory that is home to 2.3 million Palestinians continued for a sixth consecutive day as concerns mounted about the humanitarian crisis.
Israel declared war on Hamas on Saturday after hundreds of Islamic militants broke through the Gaza security fence to massacre approximately 1,300 people in Israel, including children. Gunmen seized a further 150 people, who are now being held hostage inside Gaza.
The death toll in Gaza rose above 1,400, including 447 children and 248 women, Gaza’s health ministry said, as Israel Defence Forces strikes continued to pound buildings and neighbourhoods.
Although Blinken offered unwavering support to Israel and condemned Hamas’s “reign of terror”, he also spoke of the Palestinian people’s “legitimate aspirations to live with equal measures of security, freedom, justice, opportunity and dignity”.
He told Netanyahu: “I come before you not only as the United States secretary of state but also as a Jew” and “a husband and father of young children …
“It’s impossible for me to look at the photos of families killed, such as the mother, father and three small children murdered as they sheltered in their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, and not think of my own children.”
He added that he had seen photographs and videos in meetings including of a baby riddled with bullets, soldiers beheaded and young people burned alive in their cars or hideaways. “It’s simply depravity in the worst imaginable way,” Blinken said.
One picture was posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, by the official account of the Israeli government on Thursday. “This is the most difficult image we have ever posted but we need each and every one of you to know,” the post read, above a picture of a dead baby whose face had been blurred. “This happened.”
Netanyahu said he appreciated US support, adding that Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, should be treated like Islamic State. “Just as Isis was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed,” he said.
In an indication that the conflict is expected to be protracted, some countries – including the UK, Canada and Belgium – began evacuating their nationals from Israel.
Israel said there would be no humanitarian break to its siege of the Gaza Strip until all hostages held by Hamas were released.
The energy minister, Israel Katz, wrote on social media that no “electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter” until the “abductees” were free.
The UN considers the tightened siege a war crime, and the 16-year-blockade is illegal under international humanitarian law.
“It’s a dire situation in the Gaza Strip that we’re seeing evolve with food and water being in limited supply and quickly running out,” said Brian Lander, the deputy head of emergencies at the UN World for Food Programme.
The World Health Organization warned that the health system in the Gaza Strip is “at breaking point” and “time is running out to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe”.
Residents were sifting through rubble looking for survivors and bodies. Eighteen healthcare facilities and 20 ambulances had been affected by the bombardment, and 11 healthcare workers killed, the World Health Organization said.
The UN said late on Wednesday the number of people displaced by the airstrikes had soared by 30% within 24 hours to 339,000 – two-thirds of them crowding into UN schools. Palestinian media said that bombing had killed the brother of Mohammed Deif, Hamas’s military commander, and a senior commander from Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Hazem Balousha, the Guardian’s reporter in Gaza, reached by phone on Thursday morning, said the strip’s residents had been told that hospitals had stopped admitting all but emergency cases.
Rafah, Gaza’s crossing point with Egypt, remained closed, and the only power station ran out of fuel on Tuesday, leaving the strip powered by scattered private generators. Those will shut off as well if fuel is not allowed in and the Red Cross has pleaded for fuel deliveries in order to prevent overwhelmed hospitals from “turning into morgues”.
In Israel, the reported death toll climbed to 1,300. Lt Col Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesperson, told reporters that forces were preparing for a ground assault but that the political leadership had not yet ordered one. Netanyahu, who now leads a newly formed unity government and war cabinet, including members of the opposition, has vowed to “crush and destroy” Hamas.
Benny Gantz, the leader of the centrist National Unity party, a former defence minister and a strident critic of Netanyahu’s current far-right government, said: “We are all in this together. This is not a political partnership, but rather a unity of fate. This is the time to close ranks and to win.”
Blinken is expected to meet the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Friday before visiting Qatar.
Abbas, whose Fatah movement lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007, said on Thursday: “We reject the practices of killing civilians or abusing them on both sides because they contravene morals, religion and international law,” according to official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
Blinken’s visit coincides with the arrival of a US aircraft carrier in the region, amid fears that the war could escalate, drawing in Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, and Palestinian factions in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem. In the West Bank, clashes in several areas have erupted between Palestinians and IDF troops, as well as Israeli settlers.
A ground offensive in Gaza is likely to bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting. Israel has mobilised an unprecedented 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near the strip, and evacuated tens of thousands of nearby residents.
Strategic planning has been complicated by the presence of Israeli hostages, among them children and elderly people, inside the Gaza Strip.
Israel’s Army Radio, citing a foreign diplomat, said that those kidnapped had been spread out across the enclave, some being held in private houses, and the factions themselves were not sure of the total number of hostages.

‘We escaped from danger into death’: desperation inside Gaza’s hospitals as casualties mount,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/12/israel-hamas-war-gaza-hospitals-casualties,"Palestinian residents of the enclave says the intensity of the recent Israeli attacks is unlike anything they have experienced before in other wars
In previous encounters, says Nebal Farsakh, there would always be some time without airstrikes.
“But now, there is not a single minute. That’s why the casualties keep going up and up,” says Farsakh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent.
At Shifa hospital in Gaza city, reporters from the Associated Press witnessed wounded people streaming through the doors as lifeless bodies arrived under bedsheets. As workers mopped up blood, and relatives rushed children with shrapnel wounds into surgery, explosions continued to thunder around the hospital.
Over five days, Israeli warplanes have pummelled Gaza with an intensity that its war-weary residents had never experienced. The airstrikes have killed more than 1,100 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Officials have not said how many civilians are among the dead, but aid workers warn that Israel’s decision to impose a “complete siege” on the crowded enclave of 2.3 million people is spawning a humanitarian catastrophe that touches nearly every one of them.
There is no clean water, and after the territory’s only power plant ran out of fuel on Wednesday, electricity has become a precious commodity, while the enclave sits in near-total darkness during the night.
“This is an unprecedented scope of destruction,” says Miriam Marmur, a spokesperson for Gisha, an Israeli human rights group. “Israeli decisions to cut electricity, fuel, food and medicine supplies severely compound the risks to Palestinians and threaten to greatly increase the toll in human life.”
The Israeli bombardment has escalated in retaliation for Hamas militants’ unprecedented attack in which the military says more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and dozens more abducted.
Even in ordinary times, Gaza hospitals are poorly supplied, says Richard Brennan, regional emergency director of the World Health Organization. Now, there’s a shortage of everything from bandages to intravenous fluids, beds to essential drugs.
“It’s almost as bad as it gets,” says Brennan. “It’s not just the damage, the destruction. It’s that psychological pressure. The constant shelling … the loss of one’s colleagues.”
In Shifa hospital, Muhammad al-Gharabli told AP how he had witnessed missiles crashing into a mosque in the seaside Shati refugee camp on Monday, decapitating his two-year-old son, Mohammed, and sending shrapnel into the leg of his five-year-old son, Lotfi.
Al-Gharabli says that when he regained consciousness, he saw the bodies of dozens of neighbours strewn over the ruins of their homes.
Israel says it is going after only militant targets and does its utmost to avoid civilian casualties – a claim many Palestinians in Gaza reject.
Eight journalists have been killed, local media organisations said, and six medics, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees reported 11 of its staffers among the dead.
“I lived through all the wars and incursions in the past, but I have never witnessed anything worse than this war,” Yamen Hamad, 35, a father of four, told Reuters after his home in the northern town of Beit Hanoun was destroyed by Israeli strikes.
The settlement, near the frontier with Israel, was among the first places hit hard by retaliatory strikes, with many roads and buildings destroyed and thousands of displaced, according to Hamas and local residents.
Ala al-Kafarneh told Reuters that he fled the town on Saturday with his pregnant wife, his father, brothers, cousins and in-laws. They drove to a refugee camp on the coast, where they hoped they would be safer, but air attacks began targeting that area, too, so they headed to Sheikh Radwan, another district farther east.
On Tuesday night, an airstrike hit the building where he and his family were sheltering, killing all of them except him. “We escaped from danger into death,” Kafarneh said outside Shifa hospital.
Kafarneh spoke on the pavement outside the hospital where hundreds had gathered, some saying they hoped that their proximity to the facility might spare them from the bombardment.
Some had brought blankets or strips of cardboard to sleep on, others had flung themselves straight down on to the bare ground. There were long queues for people to use the few toilets inside the hospital.
Among them was Youssef Dayer, who told Reuters that he was homeless now. “Maybe it’s safe,” he says hopefully. “Maybe. It’s a peaceful civilian place, right? Maybe not. Nowhere seems safe.”

"Hamas attack ‘deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust’, says Biden, as Israeli jets pound Gaza ",2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/12/israel-hamas-war-biden-jews-holocaust-palestine-iran-warning,"US president decries ‘campaign of pure cruelty’ and warns Iran to tread carefully as Israel conducts significant airstrikes on Palestinian enclave
Joe Biden has condemned the attack by Hamas militants on Israel at the weekend as the “deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust”, as Israeli jets continued to strike Gaza, an enclave running desperately low on medical supplies, according to the World Health Organization.
The US president told Jewish leaders gathered at the White House on Wednesday: “This attack was a campaign of pure cruelty – not just hate, but pure cruelty – against the Jewish people.”
“Silence is complicity,” Biden said. “I refuse to be silent”. He said he had spoken again to Benjamin Netanyahu and that the US was “surging” additional military assistance to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
He added that the deployment of US military ships and aircraft closer to Israel should be seen as a signal to Iran, which backs Islamist groups Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. “We made it clear to the Iranians: Be careful,” Biden said.
At around 4.30am on Thursday, Israel’s military said it was conducting a “large-scale strike” on targets belonging to Hamas in Gaza. It did not provide details. Israel is expected to launch a ground offensive in Gaza in the coming days, in response to Saturday’s attacks by Hamas that are known so far to have killed 1,200 Israelis. Israel believes Hamas is holding about 150 Israeli hostages inside Gaza.
Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, said the strikes had been continuous, compared with previous attacks. “But now, there is not a single minute. That’s why the casualties keep going up and up,” he said.
Gaza’s sole power station has run out of fuel amid a tightening siege, sparking particular concerns for the enclave’s hospitals. “Soon all services vital for the survival of the population, including hospitals, will no longer function,” said the Mezan centre for human rights in Gaza.
Even in ordinary times, Gaza hospitals are poorly supplied, said Richard Brennan, regional director of the World Health Organization (WHO). Now, there is a shortage of everything from bandages to intravenous fluids, beds to essential drugs. “It’s almost as bad as it gets,” said Brennan. “It’s not just the damage, the destruction. It’s that psychological pressure. The constant shelling … the loss of one’s colleagues.”
The death toll in Gaza has risen to 1,200, with about 5,600 wounded, Palestinian media reported, citing Gaza’s health ministry.
The number of Gaza residents displaced by the war has risen to 338,000, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said, with around 65% of them seeking safety at shelters or schools. The enclave’s population is 2.3million.
US secretary of state Antony Blinken is heading to the Middle East to show Washington’s enduring support for Israel, seek to secure the release of hostages, including Americans, and prevent a wider war from erupting.
Blinken was expected to arrive in Israel on Thursday and will also visit Jordan. Palestinian officials have said he will meet Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas.
Biden spoke after the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced an emergency wartime government, joined by Benny Gantz, a senior opposition figure and former defence minister.
Netanyahu, Gantz and Yoav Gallant, the defence minister, are forming a “war cabinet” as Israeli troops continued to build in the south of the country in preparation for an expected ground invasion.
In a televised address late on Wednesday, Netanyahu described atrocities that took place during the weekend attack by Hamas militants, who he said shot children in the head, burned people alive, raped women and beheaded soldiers. “Every Hamas member is a dead man,” he said. “We will crush and destroy it.”
Gantz told Israeli citizens that the newly formed government was “united” and ready to “wipe this thing called Hamas off the face of the Earth”.
Biden said he spoke to Netanyahu again on Wednesday, their fourth conversation in recent days, and told him Israel should follow the rules of war in its response against Hamas.
The number of American citizens known to have been killed in the Hamas attack has risen to 22, the State Department said, with at least 17 more Americans unaccounted for.
The attack has raised questions about whether Iran, the main sponsor of Hamas, played a role. But the US has information that suggests senior Iranian government officials were caught off guard by the multipronged assault, according to a US official who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
That piece of intelligence has informed White House officials publicly asserting that it has not yet seen evidence of direct involvement by Iranians in the planning or execution of the Hamas attack. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Wednesday: “We haven’t seen anything that tells they have specifically cut checks to support this set of attacks, or that they were involved in the training. And obviously, this required quite a bit of training by these terrorists,” Kirby said, though he added that the US would continue to look at the intelligence “and see if that leads us to different conclusion”.
The chairman of the powerful US House foreign affairs committee has said Israel received a warning from Egypt of potential violence three days before Hamas caught Israeli forces off-guard in a large-scale attack.
“We know that Egypt has warned the Israelis three days prior that an event like this could happen,” Republican Michael McCaul told reporters on Wednesday, after a closed-door intelligence briefing for lawmakers on the crisis.
“I don’t want to get too much into classified [details], but a warning was given,” he said. “I think the question was at what level.”

"Hamas attacks on Israel had echoes of Nazi massacres, says Antony Blinken",2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/12/hamas-attacks-on-israel-had-echoes-of-nazi-massacres-says-antony-blinken,"At press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, US secretary of state says America will always be by Israel’s side
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said the attacks by Hamas on Israel on Saturday had “harrowing echoes” of Nazi massacres, as he stood alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Jerusalem in an act of public solidarity.
Blinken, who is Jewish, vowed that the US would stand for ever alongside Israel, and said he would use his tour of the region to urge all parties, especially Hezbollah, not to broaden the conflict or open a second front.
Meanwhile, Syria said the runways at its airports in Damascus and Aleppo had been bombed by the Israeli air force, the first time Israel has hit Syria since Saturday’s attacks.
At a press conference in Tel Aviv, Blinken told Israelis: “You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself. But as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to. We will always be there by your side.”
He said at least 25 Americans were killed in the Hamas attacks and he promised there was overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress to supply Israel with whatever weaponry it needed.
Insisting this must be a moment for moral clarity, Blinken said Palestinians had legitimate aspirations but they were not represented by Hamas. He is due to meet the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, in the West Bank on Friday.
“Anyone who wants peace and justice must condemn Hamas’s reign of terror,” he said. “We know Hamas doesn’t represent the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations to live with equal measures of security, freedom, justice, opportunity and dignity.”
Blinken said: “I come before you not only as the United States secretary of state but also as a Jew. I understand on a personal level the harrowing echoes that Hamas’s massacres carry for Israeli Jews and for Jews everywhere.
“It’s impossible for me to look at the photos of families killed, such as the mother, father and three small children murdered as they sheltered in their home in kibbutz Nir Oz, and not think of my own children.”
Joe Biden had initially appeared to give Israel a blank cheque in how it pursued its plan to cleanse Gaza of Hamas, but later US officials stressed that Israel needed to conduct the war in line with international law, including by acting proportionately and protecting civilians. Iran has already accused Israel of committing a genocide.
Israel appears divided over how to pursue the aerial bombardment in Gaza, especially as there are more than 100 hostages being held by Hamas. Qatar and Turkey have been leading talks about a prisoner swap, initially involving women and children.
Blinken will be seeking an Israeli assessment of its planned land invasion designed to degrade and destroy Hamas military leadership. It is widely accepted that Israel intends to go further than the 11-day incursion into Gaza in May 2021, the fourth such incursion since Israel left Gaza in 2005.
Standing beside Blinken, Netanyahu said: “Thank you, America, for standing with Israel, today, tomorrow and always.”
Netanyahu, who has had strained relations with Biden, praised the US president for his remarks on Wednesday calling the Hamas attacks “sheer evil”. Biden also noted that the attacks were “the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust”.
“Just as Isis was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed,” Netanyahu said. “And Hamas should be treated exactly the way Isis was treated.”
Although the chances of diplomacy making much progress in the current climate seem slim, Blinken will be hoping that if Hezbollah and Iran are persuaded to avoid escalating the conflict, and Hamas is severely damaged militarily, it may be possible to persuade Israel that the status quo is not tenable and it must listen to Saudi Arabia’s call for Israel to talk with Palestine about a two-state solution. Netanyahu has shown no interest in such a step.
The US will do nothing to weaken Netanyahu at present but he will be under growing domestic pressure to explain the intelligence failure that led to the Hamas assault being so devastating. The Israeli leader has been forced to form a national unity government and US officials will be watching to see if this means he is willing to become less dependent on the extremist rightwing members of his own government.

"Egypt warned Israel of Hamas attack days earlier, senior US politician says",2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/12/israel-hamas-war-egypt-warned-foreign-affairs-gaza,"Head of US foreign affairs committee says warning was given, but it is unclear ‘at what level’, supporting claims reported from Egyptian sources
A senior US politician said Israel had received an official warning from Egypt of a possible attack from Gaza three days before Hamas launched its deadly cross-border assault on Saturday.
Michael McCaul, the chair of the US House foreign affairs committee, speaking after an intelligence briefing to senior members of Congress, said it was not clear at what level the warning was given.
“We know that Egypt has warned the Israelis three days prior that an event like this could happen,” McCaul, a Republican, told reporters on Wednesday. “I don’t want to get too much into classified [details], but a warning was given. I think the question was at what level.”
Israel was caught off-guard by Saturday’s surprise attack, when more than 1,500 Hamas fighters breached the Gaza border fence in a number of locations, killing over 1,200 Israeli civilians at a music festival, kibbutzim and other sites near the border. It took several hours before Israel’s military was able to respond on the ground.
Earlier this week, the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, denied Israel had received any advance warning from Cairo, when reports first emerged that an alert had been passed on from the country’s intelligence services.
Netanyahu said such claims were “fake news” in an address to the Israeli people on Monday. Earlier that day his office said “no early message came from Egypt” and denied that the prime minister had recently met with the head of Egyptian intelligence to discuss any such warning.
That had followed the first reports of a warning from Egypt. An Egyptian official told the Associated Press that Egypt, which often serves as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, had spoken repeatedly with the Israelis about “something big”.
The unnamed official claimed Israeli officials were focused on the West Bank and had played down the threat from Gaza. “We have warned them an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big. But they underestimated such warnings,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Cairo has not commented officially on suggestions that it may have offered an early warning to Israel. However, Egyptian media with close ties to intelligence services on Wednesday quoted senior security sources denying Israeli press reports that such a warning was issued.
Despite the denials, McCaul appeared confident that some sort of warning was passed on, and indicated he had been told that attack planning may have been going on for as long as year – without Israel or its allies noticing.
“We’re not quite sure how we missed it. We’re not quite sure how Israel missed it,” he told reporters, acknowledging that US and western intelligence had also failed to foresee an attack that has been described as the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.
Sir Alex Younger, a former head of MI6, said Hamas was likely to have been able to achieve surprise by “the complete abandonment of any electronic device or signature”, thereby evading electronic surveillance or signals intelligence.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s The Today podcast, Younger said he believed one issue was a structural problem, Israel’s “overreliance on a set of technology systems” to defend itself, including sensors to detect hostile activity near its border with Gaza. “Technology is good at revealing capabilities and actions, it’s not good at revealing intentions,” he said.
But the former spy chief, who stepped down in 2020, said Israel’s failure to pre-empt the attack also stemmed from a wider “failure of imagination” – and drew a parallel with the misjudgment in the run-up to the 9/11 attacks.
“9/11 classically was that. The assumption was not that we were vulnerable to anything in terms of this type of attack. The assumption was that it essentially wasn’t possible,” Younger said.
“And it is my assumption, therefore … that there will have been data breaking through which probably could have been interpreted differently and certainly would be, with hindsight, but people were just not looking at it in that way.”
That thinking was reflected in the fact that, Younger said, Israel had deployed at least 70% of its military in the West Bank, “including units territorially dedicated to Gaza”. There was “a conscious decision” to switch significant force away from the south, he said.
Israeli retaliatory strikes on Gaza have killed 1,100 Palestinians, including 326 children, with 5,339 people injured. More than 260,000 people have fled their homes in the Gaza Strip as heavy Israeli bombardments from the air, land and sea continued, the UN said.
The former British spy chief also warned that Hamas was “essentially laying a trap for Israel and would be well pleased if Israel commits itself to a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza” – because of the intensity of fighting and the inevitable loss of civilian life that would follow. “You cannot kill all the terrorists without creating more terrorists,” he said.

US CEOs urge Harvard to name students in groups behind letter blaming Israel for Hamas attacks,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/oct/12/harvard-letter-israel-hamas-calls-name-students,"Several chief executives called for names to be made public so that they, and others, could know not to hire the students
A group of US business leaders has demanded that Harvard University release the names of students who were part of organizations that signed a letter blaming Israel for deadly attacks by Hamas that triggered a severe escalation of violence across Israel and Gaza.
Several chief executives called for the names to be made public so that they, and others, could know not to hire the students once they leave Harvard.
Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund manager and chief executive of Pershing Square, tweeted that he and other business leaders believe the “names of the signatories should be made public so their views are publicly known”.
Ackman added: “One should not be able to hide behind a corporate shield when issuing statements supporting the actions of terrorists.”
The letter signed by around 30 Harvard student organizations was released on Sunday, in the wake of the coordinated attacks in which more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of revelers at a music festival and at least 25 Americans, were killed by Hamas militants in what Joe Biden has called the “deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust”.
The letter said the groups “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence”, adding that millions of Palestinians are forced to live in an “open air prison” with no means of escaping retaliatory air strikes that have killed more than 1,000 and displaced many more as entire neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble by the Israeli military.
“We call on the Harvard community to take action to stop the ongoing annihilation of Palestinians,” the letter concluded.
Condemnation of the letter has been strong among political and business leaders.
Seth Moulton, a Democratic congressman and former Harvard student, said he had never been more embarrassed of his alma mater.
“This is outright terrorism, and terrorism is never justified,” Moulton told WBZ-TV. “I think young Americans on college campuses need to live up to American values and be willing to have a really important honest debate, but not censor.”
Jonathan Neman, chief executive of Sweetgreen, the restaurant chain, tweeted that he would like the names of the students behind the letter.
“I would like to know so I know never to hire these people,” he said.

A truck bearing pictures of students and the words “Harvard’s leading antisemites” has been driven around the university, according to a picture posted by Jason Furman, a Harvard professor.
Furman said he had been “horrified” by celebrations over atrocities committed by Hamas but “publishing lists of students and personal information under the headings ‘terrorist’, ‘genocidal murderer’ and ‘antisemite’ is just wrong in any circumstance, and especially when many of the people named have nothing to do with the statement”.
Several groups listed at the bottom of the letter have retracted support, claiming they were unaware of its full content.
On Tuesday, Claudine Gay, the president of Harvard, said that while students have the right to speak for themselves, “no student group, not even 30 student groups, speaks for Harvard University or its leadership”.
“We will all be well served in such a difficult moment by rhetoric that aims to illuminate and not inflame,” Gay said. “And I appeal to all of us in this community of learning to keep this in mind as our conversations continue.”

UK announces repatriation flights from Israel,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/12/uk-announces-repatriation-flights-for-british-nationals-in-israel,"Announcement comes after series of airlines serving UK and Israel suspended services
The UK government is organising repatriation flights from Israel as countries around the world scramble to evacuate citizens amid the mounting crisis.
The first of the flights are due to leave from Tel Aviv on Thursday after a series of airlines serving the UK and Israel suspended services due to the risk from rockets fired from the Gaza Strip by Hamas.
Rishi Sunak earlier offered UK support to Egypt to keep the Rafah border crossing into the Gaza Strip open for humanitarian and consular reasons, including so that British nationals would be able to leave the besieged enclave.
An unknown number of British nationals are in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, while at least 17 UK nationals are reported to be either dead or missing, including children.
“Vulnerable British nationals will be prioritised for these flights. At this stage we will contact those who are eligible for the flights directly and British nationals should not make their way to the airport unless they are called,” the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said in a statement.
The flights are paid commercial flights costing £300 a ticket, which would be charged to the family or individual taking up the seat. The flights are being offered to British nationals as well as dual nationals and dependants if travelling with a British national normally resident in the UK. Families of British diplomats are also being evacuated from Israel as a “precautionary measure”.
The provision of repatriation flights came after British Airways and Virgin Atlantic suspended all services between the UK and Tel Aviv.
EasyJet, which was one of the first airlines to suspend flights at the weekend, said on Thursday that it was extending the pause until at least Monday but was evaluating the situation on a “day by day basis”.
Eastjet’s chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said the airline would like to restore the connections, including daily flights from London Luton and Gatwick airports in the UK, but if it “did not feel 100% confident, we’re not going to do it”.
While Ryanair had earlier said that it would be cutting back routes to Israel as bookings had collapsed, Lundgren said that he expected to keep flying to Tel Aviv once security allowed it, with strong demand.
Ryanair, which does not fly direct from the UK or Ireland to Israel but has numerous European connections to Tel Aviv, earlier indicated it would only restore services with state support. Its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said Ben Gurion airport had asked it to restore some flights later this week “but it’s subject to security”, adding: “Bookings to and from Israel have collapsed so it’s up to governments to decide if we keep flying.”
British Airways suspended services on Wednesday, as did Virgin Atlantic. BA’s owners, IAG, said on Thursday it expected to be pulling out all its airlines, for three weeks.
Meanwhile, at least 100 people are believed to have travelled from the UK to Israel to serve in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) as it mounts a retaliatory campaign against Hamas. The Israeli embassy in the UK said it was understood those who travelled were “reservists and active duty soldiers”.
Separately, the plight of British nationals and others trapped in Gaza was discussed in a telephone conversation on Thursday morning between the Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi and Sunak.
The Rafah crossing between Sinai and Gaza remains open, the Egyptian government said earlier on Thursday but it added that Egypt had asked Israel to avoid targeting the Palestinian side of the crossing.
A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister acknowledged the challenging security situation at the Rafah border crossing. He offered the UK’s support to try to manage this situation and keep the route open for humanitarian and consular reasons, including for British nationals.
Alicia Kearns, the chair of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, tweeted on Thursday that Israeli bombardment of the Rafah crossing must end.
“The crossing needs to be repaired so it can reopen fully for humanitarian aid deliveries from Egypt – which need commitments they won’t be targeted – and for refugees to be able to leave Gaza.”

Scottish first minister Humza Yousaf tells of war’s impact on in-laws in Gaza,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/12/scottish-first-minister-humza-yousaf-tells-of-wars-impact-on-in-laws-in-gaza,"Yousaf renews calls for UK government to urge ceasefire as he describes his family’s fears for trapped relatives
His mother-in-law in besieged Gaza is running out of drinking water. His brother-in-law, a doctor, is dealing with the horror of trying to identify body parts in a hospital nearby. And his four-year-old daughter, at home in Scotland, can only understand that “granny is afraid of the thunder”.
Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has described in brutal detail the impact on trapped family members of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza in response to the shock attacks by Hamas at the weekend.
In an interview, Yousaf renewed his calls for the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, to urge Israel “to agree to a ceasefire, open up a humanitarian corridor, let supplies come in but, importantly, let people come out”.
He said: “The world can’t sit back and witness the obliteration of 2.2 million people. We are all going to have a stain on our conscience if we allow that to happen.”
His wife’s parents, Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla, who live in Dundee, travelled to Gaza last week to visit their son and four grandchildren and Maged’s 92-year-old mother, who is unwell.
The couple have been unable to find safe passage out of Gaza since the first Hamas attack took place on the border with Israel on Saturday. On Wednesday, Yousaf’s wife, Nadia El-Nakla, told the BBC that her parents “continually tell me they feel like they’re going to die”.
Speaking to the Guardian in Bute House, his official residence in Edinburgh, on Thursday, Yousaf said Nadia had earlier received another message from her mother.
“It was another rough night, as you’d expect, and there was a lot of bombing in their neighbourhood,” he said. “The real worry for them is not just the airstrikes but the fact that they’re running really low on supplies. My mother-in-law said this morning they only have a few plastic bottles of clean drinking water left.”
Yousaf’s brother-in-law is a doctor and, he said, one of the “overwhelming majority of people in Gaza [who] have nothing to do with Hamas, and many of them live in fear of Hamas”.
Nadia last spoke to her brother on Wednesday evening. “He’s working constant shifts, manages to get home for a few hours kip and then he’s straight back out the door,” Yousaf said.
“The things he has seen, no person should see. He’s been given the job of identifying the bodies for people. He says, ‘I’m trying to match body parts up, people that are decapitated, trying to match whose head goes with whose body’.”
His parents-in-law’s household includes four children, one of whom is only two months old, cousins to Yousaf’s two daughters. “It feels like almost a hopeless situation and, frankly, I feel utterly helpless,” he said.
“Both my kids are really close to their granny but my 14-year-old is really upset,” he added. He took her out for KFC and Starbucks on Wednesday afternoon in an unsuccessful attempt to distract her.
He and his wife are struggling to explain to four-year-old Amal why her mother is upset. “She’s dead sweet … she’ll come up with a wee tissue and rub Nadia’s back. We’ve told her ‘granny’s scared of the thunder’. It’s only way we can really describe it.”
Yousaf is having regular conversation with the Foreign Office, although Cleverly has yet to respond directly to a letter Yousaf sent on Tuesday urging him to push for a humanitarian corridor.

“I don’t know anyone that suggests Israel doesn’t have the right to protect itself from terror. Those scenes that we witnessed on Saturday morning were horrific and there’s no equivocation about the fact that they are to be condemned in the strongest possible way,” said the SNP leader.
“For me, though, that cannot be a justification for the collective punishment of 2.2 million people. If you cut off electricity, food, fuel, medical supplies, then it doesn’t just harm Hamas, it harms all of those innocent civilians.”
Yousaf pleaded with the international community to remember the “ordinary human beings” caught up in the conflict.
“We can talk for hours about the geopolitical situation, the two-state solution and 1967 borders, but if we strip it back to the most basic humanity we have many people – particularly in our Jewish community – who do not know if their family members are alive or not.
“And we have those in Gaza who do not know if their family is going to survive an hour longer, and they have nothing to do with geopolitics, they are just ordinary human beings”.
A few minutes after speaking to the Guardian, during another interview, Yousaf was interrupted by his wife who entered the room crying and telling him she could not contact her family.
The first minister later explained that his wife had recognised from a TV report that a neighbourhood close to where her family were staying had been hit.
“But … thank God, her mum has got a message through saying: ‘Our neighbourhood is being hit, we haven’t been hit yet,’” he said. “The Israeli government know where our family is, they know the coordinates … so my hope is that they won’t be hit.”

Biden White House condemns Trump’s ‘dangerous’ Israel-Hamas remarks,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/12/biden-trump-comments-dangerous-israel-hamas,"2024 Republican frontrunner called Hezbollah militant group ‘very smart’, prompting a stern reaction from the White House
Joe Biden and Donald Trump continued to clash over the Israel-Hamas war on Thursday as a White House spokesman rebuked the former US president for what he called “dangerous and unhinged” comments about the conflict.
Hamas, an Iran-backed militant group based in Gaza, launched attacks on Israel on Saturday, killing more than 1,000 people and taking more than 100 hostage. Israeli air strikes have subsequently killed more than 1,000 people and significantly worsened the humanitarian situation in Gaza. A ground invasion is thought likely.
Speaking in Florida on Wednesday, Trump, the Republican frontrunner to take on Biden next year, called Hezbollah – a Lebanese group also backed by Iran and supportive of Hamas – “very smart” and the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, “a jerk”.
Around the world, the question of what the Israeli government knew about the attacks in advance continues to be debated and Trump weighed in on the issue and slammed the Israeli government.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had been “hurt very badly”, Trump said, adding: “He was not prepared. He was not prepared and Israel was not prepared. And under Trump, they wouldn’t have had to be prepared. You know, Hezbollah is very smart. They’re all very smart.”
Israel’s enemies, he said, were “vicious and they’re smart and boy, are they vicious”.
Those comments prompted a stern reaction from the White House.
“Statements like this are dangerous and unhinged,” said Andrew Bates, the deputy White House press secretary. “It’s completely lost on us why any American would ever praise an Iran-backed terrorist organisation as ‘smart’ or have any objection to the United States warning terrorists not to attack Israel.”
“This is a time for all of us to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel against unadulterated evil.”
Trump also said Netanyahu “let us down” by choosing not to participate in the US drone killing of Qassem Soleimani, a top Iranian general, in Iraq in January 2020.
“I’ll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down,” Trump said. “That was a very terrible thing.”
Tensions between Trump and Netanyahu have long been reported. In December 2021, for instance, Trump told the Axios reporter Barak Ravid he had not spoken to Netanyahu since leaving office nearly a year before.
“I haven’t spoken to him since,” Trump said.
According to Ravid, “the final straw for Trump was when Netanyahu congratulated President-elect Biden for his election victory while Trump was still disputing the result”.
In Tel Aviv on Friday, Biden’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told Netanyahu: “You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourselves, but as long as America exists you will never have to. We will always be there by your side.”
Trump and Republicans claim Biden bears responsibility for the Hamas attack. But the Biden White House was not alone in criticising Trump’s Wednesday remarks.
Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who is Trump’s closest – if distant – challenger in Republican polling, said: “It is absurd that anyone, much less someone running for president, would choose now to attack our friend and ally, Israel.”
Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, said he “was clearly pointing out how incompetent Biden and his administration were by telegraphing to the terrorists an area that is susceptible to an attack. Smart does not equal good”.
But the Israeli communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, said Trump’s comments showed he could not be relied on.
It is “shameful that a man like that, a former US president, abets propaganda and disseminates things that wound the spirit of Israel’s fighters and its citizens”, Karhi told Channel 13.

‘There are no wreaths left’: Israel begins burial of victims of Hamas attacks,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/12/there-are-no-wreaths-left-israel-begins-burial-of-victims-of-hamas-attacks,"‘All our hearts are broken’ says mourner as families of missing demand information on loved ones and await closure
Jerusalem’s streets have been quiet since Saturday’s devastating Hamas attack that killed at least 1,300 Israelis. But at the entrance to Mount Herzl, Israel’s military cemetery, cars and coaches lined the road outside for 500 metres in both directions as the country begins the long and sorrowful process of burying so many dead.
Thousands of people flowed up the steps to attend the back-to-back funerals of eight fallen soldiers on Thursday. Many were softly crying, the plaza at the top of the hill overflowing with mourners as family members of those killed paid tribute. Several people carried the Israeli flag, or had it draped around their shoulders, and a handful of men were carrying pistols and rifles.
Next to a makeshift flower stand, a hand-written sign on a piece of cardboard read: “You can take bouquets to the grave sites from here.” Most of the flowers were already gone.
At the burial of combat soldier Lt Shilo Cohen, 24, a sound system carried the voices of his family members from the white tent set up over the coffin to the crowds at the back. Not a single one of the bereaved managed to get through their farewells without crying.
“Our Shilo, look around, you can see many people here; instead of accompanying you to the celebration of your wedding, or the construction of a home, we are accompanying you to your eternal rest,” his father said.
“You died on a holy Shabbat five days ago, and your mother told me she could not sleep until you were buried.”
In dozens of towns and villages across Israel, the scene repeated. While in the Jewish tradition burials should take place as soon as possible, in Israel the delay is often limited to two days. In Islam the dead must be buried within three days, and ideally one. In the blockaded Gaza Strip, which has been pounded by Israeli airstrikes since Saturday, almost none of the 1,417 people killed so far have been interred yet because it is still too dangerous. But as with everything else that has rocked the region over the last six days, these are unprecedented circumstances.
Amid worries that the mass gatherings at funerals could pose a target for Hamas rocket fire, the chief rabbis of Israel, David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef, issued a joint public statement on Sunday in which they said: “It is possible to attend funerals remotely by reciting chapters of Psalms in honour of the victims.”
For those killed who have only a handful of family members in the country, members of the public have stepped in to make a minyan, the quorum of 10 adults required for certain religious rites and events. After the mother and sister of 24-year-old Bruna Valeanu, who was killed at the kibbutz rave, put out a request on social media for eight more people to attend the Brazilian-Israeli’s funeral in Petah Tikva on Tuesday, 10,000 people came to pay their respects and share in her family’s grief.
In Zeitan, a town in the centre of the country, flower exporter Lihi Salpeter Danziger has organised 100 volunteers, working in shifts, to make funeral wreaths of roses and chrysanthemums that are then boxed and delivered to grieving families for free.
“You have to understand that there are no wreaths left in Israel any more,” she told Reuters. “People cannot get and cannot find flowers to take to funerals for the size of this event.”
Tirtsa Gil, a 25-year-old from Metula, on the Blue Line boundary with Lebanon, had driven south for the funeral of her friend Aran Cohen, 20, a military conscript who was killed responding to the attack on the kibbutz trance party that left 260 dead. She said she had been to three funerals in the last two days.
“My brain can’t take any of this in. I can’t even speak properly, I don’t have words,” she said. “My heart is broken … All our hearts are broken.”
For Or Baruch, 30, from the same moshav as Lt Dekal Suisa, a 23-year-old platoon commander, his fallen neighbour was a hero. “The whole moshav is here,” he said.
Yet for families of the estimated hundreds still missing, there still cannot be the closure of laying their loved ones to rest. The scale of the massacres in southern Israel’s towns, army bases and kibbutzim has become apparent this week, as reporters have been able to access the sites. More and more bodies are found each day.
Another estimated 100–150 people are believed to be held hostage in Gaza, where Palestinian factions have claimed four have already died in Israeli bombings, and Hamas has threatened to execute one Israeli for every strike on a civilian site in Gaza that is carried out without warning.
Keren Shem, whose daughter, Mia, has been missing since the kibbutz party, told Israel’s army radio on Thursday morning that no government officials had yet been in contact with her.
“I demand that the decision-makers drop everything now and ask for and demand an orderly list of the missing people, with names. Because my daughter may have bled to death – I don’t know. I demand to know,” she said.
There are many funerals still to come in the coming days and weeks across Israel, Gaza and the occupied West Bank. And for some of the bereaved, there may never be answers, or a body to bury.

UK to send navy ships and spy planes to support Israel,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/12/uk-to-send-navy-ships-and-spy-planes-to-support-israel,"British PM says aim is to support efforts to ensure regional stability and prevent further escalation
Britain will send surveillance aircraft, two Royal Navy support ships and about 100 Royal Marines to the eastern Mediterranean from Friday to support Israel and help prevent any sudden escalation of fighting in the Middle East.
Patrol flights of Poseidon P-8 aircraft and other planes will begin on Friday, Downing St announced, tasked partly with monitoring any efforts to transfer of weapons from countries such as Iran or Russia to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Existing UK military units and fighter aircraft, based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, are also on alert as Israel gears up for an expected ground assault on Gaza after last Saturday’s surprise attack by Hamas, which has left more than 1,300 Israeli civilians dead. The death toll in Gaza has risen above 1,400.
Concern remains high that Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, may seek to open a second front from the north with the backing of its ally, Iran. Earlier on Thursday, Syria said that its airports in Damascus and Aleppo were bombed by the Israeli air force, most likely in an effort to disrupt any supplies of weaponry bound for the group.
Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, said the UK’s intention was to “support efforts to ensure regional stability and prevent further escalation”, and to “ensure humanitarian aid reaches the thousands of innocent victims of this barbaric attack from Hamas terrorists”.
Earlier this week, a US aircraft carrier, the Gerald R Ford, arrived in the eastern Mediterranean, with a cruiser and four destroyers in support, aimed also at deterring any actor from “seeking to escalate the situation or widen this war”.
The UK’s naval task group is significantly smaller, consisting of support ships. It is led by the RFA Lyme Bay, a logistics support vessel, and RFA Argus, the Royal Navy’s emergency medical ship, which has a capacity of 100 beds.
The Ministry of Defence said this was “a contingency measure” to support humanitarian efforts, although it was not immediately spelled out who they would be assisting. Gaza is subject to an Israeli blockade.
Britain already has two warships in the region, HMS Duncan, tasked to Nato, in the eastern Mediterranean, and HMS Lancaster, part of the UK’s permanent naval presence in the Persian Gulf.
Downing St also said that Sunak had spoken to Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, earlier on Thursday as part of an effort, No 10 said, to “understand the wider regional picture and underscore the importance of supporting civilians to leave Gaza”.

"No power, water or fuel to Gaza until hostages freed, says Israel minister",2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/12/no-power-water-or-fuel-to-gaza-until-hostages-freed-says-israeli-minister,"US secretary of state lands in Tel Aviv after fifth night of bombardment and preparations for ground invasion
Israel has said there will be no humanitarian break to its siege of the Gaza Strip until all its hostages are freed, amid growing concern over dwindling water, food and fuel supplies after a fifth night of bombardment.
The energy minister, Israel Katz, wrote on social media that no “electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter” until the “abductees” were free. The United Nations experts have condemned the Israeli bombardment as “collective punishment”, which is a war crime.
Israel is preparing to launch a ground invasion in response to bloody massacres carried out in 20 Israeli communities by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas last weekend, during which dozens of hostages were also seized, in the most serious escalation in the region for 50 years.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, landed in Tel Aviv on Thursday as part of a Middle East tour to show Washington’s solidarity with Israel, after a first plane loaded with US munitions arrived in Israel on Wednesday night. “You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself,” Blinken said at a joint press conference with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. “But as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to. We will always be there by your side.”
Israel Defence Forces strikes killed at least 33 people within two hours overnight on Thursday, according to Al Jazeera’s local reporter, bringing the death toll in Gaza to 1,354. The reporter said fighter jets had attacked houses in several areas, and civil defence groups recovered the bodies of the dead. In some areas, residents were sifting through rubble with their bare hands looking for survivors and bodies.
According to the report, since the fighting began, six neighbourhoods in the strip have been destroyed. Eighteen healthcare facilities and 20 ambulances had been affected and 11 healthcare workers killed, the World Health Organization said, in the most intense bombing campaign the strip has suffered in the 16 years since Hamas seized control of the tiny, overcrowded area, home to 2.3 million people.
The UN said late on Wednesday the number of people displaced by the airstrikes had soared 30% within 24 hours to 339,000 – two-thirds of them crowding into UN schools. Palestinian media said that bombing had killed the brother of Mohammed Deif, Hamas’s military commander, and a senior commander from Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Hazem Balousha, the Guardian’s reporter in Gaza, reached by phone on Thursday morning, said the strip’s residents had been told that hospitals had stopped admitting all but emergency cases. Rafah, Gaza’s crossing point with Egypt, remained closed, and the only power station ran out of fuel on Tuesday, leaving the strip powered by scattered private generators. Those will shut off as well if fuel is not allowed in and the Red Cross has pleaded for fuel deliveries in order to prevent overwhelmed hospitals from “turning into morgues”.
In Israel, the reported death toll has climbed to 1,300. Lt Col Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesperson, told reporters on Thursday that forces were preparing for a ground assault but that the political leadership had not yet ordered one. Netanyahu has vowed to “crush and destroy” Hamas and as of Wednesday night, he leads a newly formed unity government and war cabinet, including members of the opposition.
Benny Gantz, the leader of the centrist National Unity party, a former defence minister and a strident critic of Netanyahu’s current far-right government, said: “We are all in this together. We are all enlisting. This is not a political partnership, but rather a unity of fate. This is the time to close ranks and to win.”
Blinken will also visit Jordan, and Palestinian officials have said he will meet the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, who controls parts of the West Bank.
Abbas, whose Fatah movement lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007, has not condemned the attacks on Israel, instead blaming the violence on the neglect of Palestinian grievances and the 56-year-old occupation, and has called for Palestinians outside Gaza to resist the Israeli military.
Blinken’s visit coincides with the arrival of a US aircraft carrier in the region, amid fears that the events of the last week could escalate, drawing in Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, and Palestinian factions in the occupied West Bank and the restive city of Jerusalem. In the West Bank, clashes in several areas have erupted between Palestinians and IDF troops, as well as Israeli settlers living in the territory.
Gen Michael Kurilla, commander of US central command, said: “The arrival of these highly capable forces to the region is a strong signal of deterrence should any actor hostile to Israel consider trying to take advantage of this situation.”
The emergency war cabinet must decide now what the country’s strategic objectives will be in Gaza. A ground offensive, the first since a seven-week war in 2014, is likely to bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting. Israel has mobilised an unprecedented 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near the strip, and evacuated tens of thousands of residents from nearby communities.
Overnight, fighting continued on Israeli soil on the Gaza periphery, as the IDF struggled to secure the breached security fence the country had relied on to contain Hamas. Eleven Palestinian militants were reported killed by the Israeli media.
Strategic planning has been complicated by the presence of Israeli hostages, among them children and elderly people, inside the Gaza Strip.
Israel’s Army Radio, citing a foreign diplomat, said that those kidnapped had been spread out across the enclave, some being held in private houses, and the factions themselves were not sure of the total number of hostages. Israeli media has put the figure at between 100 and 150.
As reporters have gained access to affected towns and kibbutzim this week, the scale of the carnage is becoming clearer. IDF officials said they entered homes strewn with bodies, finding women who had been raped and killed, and children who had been shot and burned.

European leaders pledge crackdown on antisemitism as incidents rise,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/12/scholz-pledges-zero-tolerance-as-antisemitic-incidents-rise-in-europe,"Bans on pro-Hamas celebrations and pro-Palestinian protests announced in several countries amid tensions
Officials across Europe are scrambling to curtail any spillover of tensions from the Israel-Hamas war, with Germany pledging a “zero tolerance” approach to antisemitism and France banning pro-Palestinian protests amid concerns for public order.
The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, told parliament on Thursday that while thousands of people had rallied in support of Israel, the country had also seen “disgraceful images on our streets in which the most brutal acts of terror have been celebrated in broad daylight”.
The remarks came after demonstrations in Berlin and Duisburg in which sweets and cakes were handed out to participants as some danced and cheered in apparent joy at the atrocities carried out in Israel.
Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, warned that antisemitic acts and defending terrorism would be dealt with “severely” in France – home to a large Jewish and Muslim populations – in a televised address on the Israel-Hamas crisis on Thursday evening
The French president said the country should not give in to “any form of hate” but must remain united. “Let us not add national divisions to international divisions,” he said.
In recent days 24 people had been arrested after a spate of antisemitic incidents, said the country’s interior minister, Gérald Darmanin.
Scholz announced a ban in Germany on all activity lauding Hamas crimes in Israel, including the use of their symbols, or expressions of praise for murder and manslaughter, and the burning of the Israeli flag. Anyone found to be doing so would be prosecuted, he said.
In announcing the measures, Scholz pointed to Germany’s particular responsibility towards Israel owing to its previous role as the perpetrator of the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were murdered.
“Our law governing associations is a sharp sword. And we, as a strong constitutional state, will draw this sword,” said Scholz. There would be “zero tolerance for antisemitism”, he added.
Three Jewish schools in Amsterdam said they planned to close on Friday in order to protect the safety of pupils and teachers. The decision was reportedly made after a former Hamas chief called for protests across the Muslim world on Friday in support of the Palestinians.
In France, Macron said the conflict was not between Israel and Palestine but between “terrorists and a country with democratic values”. He offered his “firm and complete” support to Israel, which he said had every right to respond, but said that response had to be “strong and fair”.
“Israel has the right to defend itself … but with targeted actions that preserve the civilian populations. That is the duty of democracies,” he said.
Thirteen French citizens were killed in Hamas attacks on Israel at the weekend. Another 17, including children, are reported missing. Several are believed to be being held hostage in Gaza.
“My thoughts are with the families this evening. I want to tell them that France is doing everything possible alongside the Israeli authorities and our partners to bring them back safely to their homes,” Macron said. “France will never abandon its children.”
The president’s address came after Darmanin banned pro-Palestinian demonstrations in the country on the grounds they were a threat to public order.
On Thursday the Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said his country was strengthening the security of its Jewish community, adding in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that there was “an increased vigilance for antisemitic attacks”.
The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, pledged £3m in extra funding to protect Jewish schools and synagogues in the country, after the Community Security Trust, a body that provides security advice to Jewish communities, said reports of antisemitic incidents had increased 324% since the weekend compared with the same period last year.
In Spain and Portugal, there was consternation after two synagogues were vandalised with pro-Palestinian graffiti.
The Jewish Community of Porto said the Kadoorie Mekor Haim synagogue had been daubed with graffiti including the slogans “free Palestine” and “end Israel apartheid” on Wednesday.
A synagogue in Spain was also defaced with the words “free Palestine” over the weekend. The incidents have put members of the Jewish community on high alert. The synagogue of the Jewish community of Barcelona said it had cancelled weeks of upcoming events amid security concerns.
“We’re scared, particularly for our young sons and daughters,” Sara Hasson told the newspaper El Periódico. “Antisemitism is in the air.”

Hamas and Israel at war: what we know on day 6,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/12/hamas-and-israel-at-war-what-we-know-on-day-6,"Hamas attack ‘deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust’, says Biden; Gaza’s only power station runs out of fuel
Israel has begun the long and sorrowful process of burying the victims of the weekend’s attacks by Hamas. The most recent death toll in Israel stands at 1,200. Israel’s military spokesperson said the government has been able to confirm the identities of 97 people taken hostage into Gaza during the attack by Hamas. More than 100 are believed to have been taken.
More than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes since Saturday, Gaza’s health ministry said on Thursday. Among them are 500 children and 276 women, it said. A further 6,612 were wounded in Israeli airstrikes on the Palestinian enclave, the ministry said.
Israeli strikes have killed three journalists so far, and two others died as a result of gunshot wounds, according to Reporters without Borders. Some 12 workers with the UN Palestinian refugee agency have been killed in Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, the organisation has said.
More than 338,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in the Gaza Strip, the UN said on Thursday, as heavy Israeli bombardments continue to hit the Palestinian enclave.
The World Health Organization said it has documented 34 attacks on health care in Gaza since last Saturday that have resulted in the death of 11 health workers, 16 injuries, and damages to 19 health facilities and 20 ambulances. In a statement on Thursday, the WHO warned that the health system in the Gaza Strip is “at breaking point”, and that “time is running out to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe”.
The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) said the situation in the Gaza Strip is “dire” and “devastating” and warned that crucial supplies were running dangerously low after Israel imposed a total blockade on the territory. Israel’s energy minister, Israel Katz, said no power, water or fuel will be allowed into Gaza until Israeli hostages are returned home.
Human Rights Watch said it had concluded Israel used white phosphorus in military operations over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border this week. Israel’s use of white phosphorus in crowded civilian areas “poses a high risk of excruciating burns and lifelong suffering” , the organisation warned.
A ground offensive will be launched on Gaza “when opportune and fit for our purposes”, the IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said in an update early on Thursday.
The Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, said Gazans must “stay steadfast and remain on their land” amid growing calls for Cairo to allow safe passage to civilians fleeing Gaza. The only viable exit for Gazans to flee is through the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, but Egypt has rejected any move to set up safe corridors for refugees fleeing Gaza.
The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, spoke to the king of Jordan, Abdullah II, on Thursday. Abbas stressed “the rejection of … killing civilians or abusing them on both sides” and called for the release of civilians, prisoners and detainees.
Two police officers were wounded after a shooting attack near the Herod’s Gate entrance to the Jerusalem old city, Israeli police said. The gunman used a makeshift submachine gun in the attack, according to police. Officers returned fire and “neutralised” him, police said.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the attacks by Hamas had “harrowing echoes” of Nazi massacres, as he stood alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Jerusalem in an act of public solidarity. Blinken vowed that the US would stand for ever alongside Israel, and said he would use his tour of the region to urge all parties, especially Hezbollah, not to broaden the conflict or open a second front. The death toll of US citizens in Israel now stands at 27, the White House said on Thursday. The number of Americans unaccounted for is 14.
Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, warned that the “continuation of war crimes against Palestine and Gaza” could open a new front of war, and that Israel will be “responsible for the consequences”. Abdollahian arrived in the Lebanese capital Beirut on Thursday, where he was received by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Hamas.
Syria said Israeli forces launched simultaneous missile attacks on the airports in its capital Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo on Thursday. “Bursts of missiles” hit the two airports at the same time, a Syrian military source was cited as saying in what he said was a bid to distract the world’s attention from Israel’s war with Hamas militants in Gaza.
The UK will deploy patrol and surveillance aircraft and two Royal Navy ships to the eastern Mediterranean “to support Israel”, the government said. Maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft will begin flying in the region “to track threats to regional stability”, Downing Street said.
Emmanuel Macron said France is “doing everything possible” for the citizens missing in Israel, in a televised address on Thursday evening. “France will never abandon its children,” the French president said. Thirteen French citizens were killed in Hamas attacks on Israel at the weekend. Another 17, including children, are reported missing. Several are believed to be being held hostage in Gaza.
The US and Qatar have agreed to deny Iran’s access to any of the $6bn (£4.9bn) funds that were part of a prisoner swap deal between the Biden administration and Tehran last month, the US deputy treasury secretary, Wally Adeyemo, reportedly told House Democrats.
The British government is organising flights to repatriate British nationals from Israel, with the first due to leave from Tel Aviv on Thursday. British nationals will be invited to take up seats on the flights along with dual nationals, and dependants if travelling with a British national normally resident in the UK.
The British children of elderly hostages abducted by Hamas pleaded for their return as they described the invasion of Israel as a “second Holocaust”. Seventeen British nationals are feared dead or missing after the weekend’s atrocities.
Officials across Europe scrambled to curtail any spillover of tensions from the Israel-Hamas war, with Germany pledging a “zero tolerance” approach to antisemitism and France banning pro-Palestinian protests amid concerns for public order.
The EU has sent a second missive to Elon Musk, the owner of X, formerly Twitter, over the alleged spread of illegal “terrorist and violent content” on the platform in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel on Saturday.
Two Jewish schools in north-west London are set to close temporarily because of safety fears after the crisis in Israel and Gaza, as ministers announced £3m for a charity that helps protect Jewish community sites.

Melbourne Catholic school’s ban on mullets and dreadlocks criticised by students,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/12/emmanuel-college-melbourne-mullet-dreadlock-ban,"Emmanuel College defends move against ‘excessive hairstyles’ as students say there is little justification for the ban
A Melbourne Catholic college’s strict ban on mullets, dreadlocks and makeup has sparked fierce backlash from students.
The principal of Emmanuel College in Altona North, in Melbourne’s west, wrote to parents and students last month saying “excessive hairstyles”, including deadlocks and mullets, were not acceptable at the school. The note to parents was first reported by the Herald Sun.
The principal, Janine Biggin, had argued holding students to account regarding adhering to the personal grooming and uniform policy was a matter of “equity and fairness”.
Students subsequently penned an open letter to the school community and staff pushing back against the stricter expectations.
“Why is the uniform and the appearance of students’ much more important than their education and wellbeing?” the letter said.
The students argued they were not “intentionally seeking to disregard the college’s expectations”.
“Rather, they may not perceive those expectations as significant due to the lack of impact it has on their education and behaviour in school,” they said.

Biggin told Guardian Australia the uniform policy was developed in consultation with families through the school advisory council.
“As a matter of equity, comfort, and safety, along with pride in the college, we maintain clear expectations for student appearance and grooming,” she said.
“As always, ongoing listening to the voice and views of our young people is also an important consideration.”
Referencing the mullet ban, the students said it was a “popular Australian hairstyle” and it was unclear why it was prohibited.
“Many students have mullet hairstyles already despite the expectations and are often not extreme,” the student’s open letter said.

The letter says dreadlocks are commonly worn by people of colour and deeming them unacceptable “raises questions and concerns of racial bias within the college”.
In the original email to parents, Biggin said students were permitted to wear single, simple stud earrings but were not allowed to wear sleeper-style earrings or have nose or other piercings.
“Clear studs are not permitted. The wearing of other fashion accessories is not appropriate,” the email said.
But the student’s letter argued earrings were a personal choice and had no impact on a student’s learning.
The school also has a ban on tattoos, makeup, fake nails, nail polish, false eyelashes and extensions.
“When students make a choice not to observe these standards, they are choosing to disregard college expectations and staff will be obliged to issue consequences to assist the students to be responsible for their choices,” Biggin wrote.

Asio warns against inflamed language over Middle East amid concern of ‘opportunistic violence’,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/12/israel-hamas-war-conflict-asio-warning-middle-east-violence-australia,"Mike Burgess issues rare public statement asking ‘all parties consider the implications for social cohesion’
An Australian intelligence chief has urged leaders to safeguard social cohesion amid bloodshed in the Middle East, warning that “inflamed language” may fuel community tensions.
The head of Asio, Mike Burgess, issued a rare public statement to say Australia’s terrorism threat level had not increased, but his agency was “concerned about the potential for opportunistic violence with little or no warning”.
The statement also included a plea for community harmony, with Burgess saying that “words matter”. He urged “all parties consider the implications for social cohesion when making public statements”.
The public intervention comes amid an increasingly heated public debate in Australia after antisemitic chants were made by some people attending pro-Palestine rallies this week. The chants have been condemned by politicians from across the political spectrum.
The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, falsely suggested on Wednesday that Anthony Albanese had not recognised or condemned antisemitism – even though the prime minister had done so multiple times since Monday.
On Thursday morning, Dutton told 2GB: “If there were people there [at the rallies] who were on visas, they should be identified and have their visas cancelled. They should be deported.”
Burgess did not name any individuals in his statement on Thursday afternoon, but said tensions in the Middle East were “resonating in the Australian community”.
The Asio chief said protests, rallies and associated activities were “expected to continue” and were “likely to feature strong emotive claims”.
“I remain concerned about the potential for opportunistic violence with little or no warning. However, it is important to distinguish opportunistic violence from planned violence or acts of terrorism,” Burgess said.
“Asio is carefully monitoring the situation for any indications of planned violence and were we to see any, we would respond accordingly, along with our law enforcement partners.”
Burgess added: “In this context, it is important that all parties consider the implications for social cohesion when making public statements. As I have said previously, words matter. Asio has seen direct connections between inflamed language and inflamed community tensions.”
He said that agency was “not interested in those who are engaged in lawful protest, but rather the small subset of protesters who may wish to escalate protest to violence”.
That subset “includes religiously motivated and ideologically motivated extremists, or anyone who believes that violence is a means to further their own interests”.
Albanese said the Asio statement highlighted the need for “moderation in language”.
“We are a great multicultural nation,” the prime minister told reporters in Perth.
“It’s important that people, including people in public life, are non-inflammatory in their language which is used at this difficult time.”
Dutton’s call for visa cancellations for some protesters has concerned some on the grounds it could contribute to the demonisation of Palestinian Australians and interferes with rights to free assembly and freedom of speech.
Neha Madhok, national director of at racial justice organisation Democracy in Colour, said threatening protesters with deportation was “outrageous” and noted that everyone had the right to protest in Australia.
“Right now it is important to de-escalate tensions, not inflame them,” Madhok said.
But Jeremy Leibler, president of the Zionist Federation of Australia, backed the call.
“Of course they should be [cancelled],” he told Guardian Australia.

“Obviously you can’t deport Australian citizens, but if you have people on temporary visas waving Isis flags, yes, they should be deported. Is it even a debate? If they’d robbed a bank, they would be deported.”
Israel is expected to launch a ground offensive in Gaza in the coming days, in response to Saturday’s attacks by Hamas which have killed 1,200 Israelis. Israel believes Hamas is holding about 150 Israeli hostages inside Gaza.
The death toll in Gaza has risen to 1,200, with about 5,600 wounded, amid ongoing Israeli strikes, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Gaza’s sole power station has run out of fuel amid a tightening siege, sparking particular concerns for its hospitals.
The Australian government indicated on Thursday it was planning a third repatriation flight from Israel, anticipating “quite large demand” to flee a conflict with ramifications for “months or years to come”. The Department and Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement it was supporting more than 1,500 registered Australians, although not all wished to leave.
The former Liberal prime minister John Howard has been among the critics of Labor’s response to the unfolding events in the Middle East.
In a front-page article in the Australian newspaper on Wednesday, Howard accused Labor of “pussyfooting and lukewarm condemnation”.
He said: “How can you remain calm when demonstrators are invoking the memory of the Holocaust? People remain calm in that?
“We need leadership from the top; we aren’t getting that at the moment.”
Albanese has repeatedly criticised the Hamas attacks on Israel and asserted the country’s right to defend itself.
On Tuesday, Albanese also condemned the “appalling” chants said at the rally outside the Opera House and repeated that there was “no place for antisemitism in this country or, indeed, anywhere else”.
“We need to fight racism wherever we see it, whether it’s antisemitism, Islamophobia, some of the racially charged comments that have been made against Indigenous Australians during this referendum,” Albanese said on Tuesday.
A planned pro-Palestine march through the streets of Sydney on Sunday has been scrapped in favour of a “static demonstration” at Hyde Park after the premier, Chris Minns, vowed to stop any marches.
Australia’s national terrorism threat level remains at “possible”, where it has been since November last year. At that time the threat level was lowered after eight years as “probable”.

Plus, why are one in seven of us addicted to ultra-processed foods?
Good morning.
Israel will not restore power, water or fuel to Gaza until the hostages taken by Hamas over the weekend are freed, an Israeli minister has said. Israel believes Hamas is holding about 150 Israeli hostages inside Gaza.
Israel Katz, Israel’s energy minister, said: “Humanitarian aid to Gaza? No electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home. Humanitarianism for humanitarianism. And no one will preach us morality.”
In the US, Joe Biden has condemned the attack by Hamas militants on Israel at the weekend as the “deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust”, with Israeli jets continuing to strike Gaza, an enclave running desperately low on medical supplies, according to the World Health Organization.
“Silence is complicity,” Biden said. “I refuse to be silent.” He said he had spoken again to Benjamin Netanyahu and that the US was “surging” additional military assistance to the Israel Defence Forces.
What’s happening on the ground today? At about 4.30am, Israel’s military said it was conducting a “large-scale strike” on targets belonging to Hamas in Gaza. It did not provide details. Israel is expected to launch a ground offensive in Gaza in the coming days.
Donald Trump demanded an apology from Forbes magazine after it dropped him from its list of the 400 wealthiest people in the US for the second time in three years.
“I hereby demand a full apology from the failing Forbes magazine,” the former president wrote on Truth Social yesterday, the reportedly struggling social media platform he set up after being expelled from mainstream platforms over the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
Forbes released its Trump-free list last week, saying his net worth was down $600m from a year before. Trump has been on the list since the 1990s, other than in 2021.
In response, Trump complained about “really dumb writers assigned to hit me hard” and bragged about huge leads in Republican presidential polling he holds despite facing 91 criminal charges and assorted civil threats.
How has Forbes responded? Dan Alexander, a senior editor at Forbes and the author of a 2020 book, White House Inc: How Donald Trump Turned the Presidency Into a Business, tweeted: “Hey Donald Trump, if you want to point out a single false fact in any of the articles I’ve published about you – or in the book I wrote about you – feel free. In the meantime, I’m going to keep reporting – and carefully fact-checking every word I publish.”
What else is going on for Trump? A federal judge is today expected to weigh whether the lawyers for Trump’s two co-defendants, charged with trying to obstruct the US justice department from retrieving classified documents from his Mar-a-Lago club, had conflicts of interest and should be ordered off the case.
Women seeking jobs as domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates allege they are being detained and abused in squalid accommodation, while recruiters sell them over apps and social media platforms to household employers, according to interviews and documents seen by the Guardian.
In a series of interviews conducted over several years, 14 women from east Africa and the Philippines recounted their experiences with recruitment agencies, including alleging they were denied food, held captive and treated violently.
The Guardian has also seen evidence that the women are being marketed in an “exploitative” way reminiscent of slavery, according to one expert, with employers charged less for the services of black domestic workers and being told they did not even need to provide them with proper bedrooms.
The women’s testimony gives a rare insight into what life is like in domestic worker agency accommodation as people wait, in limbo, for an employer to take them on. It is a process that can take months, with women often being returned to the agencies at the whim of an employer.
The former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has pleaded guilty to fraud at Southwark crown court in London after failing to declare more than £400m  ($490m) of overseas assets to the UK government. Ecclestone had pleaded not guilty to the charges in August, but changed his plea at a case management hearing today.
New York Republicans in the US House yesterday moved to expel one of their own: George Santos, the serial fabulist and accused fraudster who faces new charges under a superseding federal indictment. In response, Santos said he was going nowhere, asking his “fellow Americans” to “stay strong”.
In 2013, Brett Hemphill dived more than 40 storeys deep in Texas’s Phantom Springs underwater cave system to set a national record. Last weekend, his diving colleagues pulled his body out of that same treacherous labyrinth, days after the 56-year-old had gone missing during an expedition.

We know ultra-processed foods (UPFs) such as crisps, fizzy drinks and ice-cream can be extremely harmful to health, are designed to be hyper-palatable and are overeaten, writes Rachel Dixon. Now researchers believe they are not just hard to resist – they are actually addictive. An analysis of 281 studies in 36 countries by scientists from the US, Spain and Brazil, published in the BMJ, found that 14% of adults and 12% of children have a food addiction, and the food they are addicted to is ultra-processed.
But surely food cannot be addictive in the same way as alcohol or tobacco, Dixon asks Chris van Tulleken, a doctor and the author of Ultra-Processed People. “I totally agree that food is not addictive,” he says. “But UPF is not really food. The purpose of food is to provide nourishment. UPF’s primary purpose is profit and financial growth.”
Government backtracking on environmental promises is being driven by politicians and vested interests, not the public, the acting UN biodiversity chief has said, as he called for greater support for those experiencing the short-term costs of green policies. David Cooper cited the recent citizens’ assembly on biodiversity in Ireland and the vote in Ecuador against continuing with oil and gas exploration in the Amazon rainforest as moments when the public had pushed for stronger environmental protections.
“We see some backtracking in different parts of the world but a lot of this is political groups trying to find wedge issues to gain a marginal advantage in an upcoming election,” he said. “When the public are allowed to express their views, they come up with good decisions … People are actually ahead of the governments.”

Antisemitic chants to be treated as a hate crime under tough new Queensland laws,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/12/queensland-laws-antisemitic-chants-hate-crime,"Comments heard at a recent pro-Palestine protest in Sydney would come under the laws which aim to crack down on vilification, lawyers say
Antisemitic chants heard in the recent pro-Palestine protest in Sydney would be treated as a hate crime under tough new Queensland laws aimed at cracking down on vilification, lawyers say.
The state passed new legislation on Thursday that moves serious vilification from the anti-discrimination act into the criminal code, makes it easier to prosecute and increases the maximum penalty from six months’ jail to three years.
Under the laws, the public display, distribution or publishing of a hate symbol when used to “menace, harass or offend” will also attract a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment.
At the protest on Monday, protesters were heard chanting “fuck the Jews” and “gas the Jews” on the steps of the Sydney Opera House.
Rita Jabri Markwell, a lawyer and adviser to the Australian Muslim Advocacy Network, said similar antisemitic remarks would now be treated as a hate crime in Queensland.
“Shouting comments that directly attack or express hatred for Jews … in a public place would be treated as a hate crime under this legislation,” she told Guardian Australia.
“Assault, threatening violence, stalking, disturbing religious worship and property damage are other areas of crime that will be treated as a hate crime where there is a whole or partial hate motive.
“Under this bill, the same protection would apply to any group based on race, religion, sexuality, sex characteristics or gender identity of a person.”

The president of the Queensland Jewish Board of Deputies, Jason Steinberg, said his community welcomed the passing of the new hate crime legislation.“In today’s environment we are seeing vicious antisemitic statements in southern states calling for Jews to be killed, and in our own state we’re seeing rightwing extremists display Nazi hate symbols and peddle their rightwing propaganda,” Steinberg told Guardian Australia.
“The new laws should serve as a significant deterrent to anyone in Queensland who thinks it’s OK to be antisemitic, display Nazi hate symbols or threaten anyone who is of a different religion, race or gender.”
Before a symbol – such as a Nazi hooked cross – can be prescribed as a hate symbol, consultation must occur with the Crime and Corruption Commission, the Human Rights Commissioner and the commissioner of the Queensland Police Service.
A spokesperson at the department of justice said where an offender could be charged for chanting antisemitic remarks “would depend upon … whether the elements of the offence under the Criminal Code or the Summary Offences Act and the circumstance of aggravation could be proved”.
The chair of the committee looking into the legislation, Peter Russo, said it was anticipated hate symbols relating to Nazi and Islamic State ideology would ultimately be proscribed.
“This is a very positive step, although I understand there is scope for further improvements to be made,” he said.

Jabri Markwell said the laws balance freedom of speech “while recognising that there are certain lines that should never be crossed”.
The attorney general, Yvette D’Ath, said serious vilification and hate crimes had “no place in our communities”.
“The effects are corrosive, eroding trust and depriving individuals of their safety and sense of belonging,” she said in a statement.
Speaking to parliament on Wednesday, the shadow attorney general, Tim Nicholls, said the opposition supported the bill but did not agree “solely in passing more and more restrictive legislation on the freedom of speech”.
“The danger with that is that the tighter the squeeze, the more slips between the grasp.”
The LNP MP Sam O’Connor said “vilification must be called out” and condemned the antisemitic remarks heard in Sydney.
“Over the last couple of days the antisemitism on display in other parts of our country has been disgraceful,” he told parliament.
“Turning to the bill before us … any step we take towards reducing vilification and hate in our state is a crucial step towards promoting a more inclusive and safe society.”
The Greens MP Michael Berkman said his party supported the laws but called for stronger action to be taken, including giving the human rights commissioner the power to veto decisions regarding hate symbols.

"Flooding of Melbourne retirement village left second world war refugee with PTSD, inquiry hears",2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/12/melbourne-retirement-village-flood-ptsd-war-refugee,"About 70 people were displaced and 47 homes in Maribyrnong inundated last October
An elderly man left homeless after Melbourne’s Maribyrnong flood last year says being displaced sparked memories of fleeing Germany during the second world war and caused him to become a “refugee for a second time”.
Two residents of Rivervue retirement village, where about 70 people were displaced and 47 homes inundated during last October’s floods, appeared before a Victorian parliamentary inquiry investigating the disaster on Thursday.

Stanislaw Korkliniewski, who has lived at the retirement village in Avondale Heights since 2018, said the flooding triggered memories of being displaced after fleeing war-torn Germany in the 1940s.
“The weight of depression, anxiety and panic attacks became my norm,” he told the inquiry.
“Now with medical care I know that the flooding of Rivervue means I have PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder].”
Fellow resident Colin Waters, who has lived at Rivervue with his wife since 2017, said he estimated his home was worth $1.3m prior to the flooding and now was “pretty much worthless”
“It’s built in a swamp,” he told the inquiry.
The Age last year revealed the former head of the Melbourne Water inquiry previously supported planning changes – approved by the state government in 2016 – that covered a portion of the retirement village that sits alongside Maribyrnong river.
The zoning amendment moved the one-in-100 year flood risk closer to the river, which resulted in homes being built on land previously considered unsuitable.
Waters told the inquiry that Melbourne Water’s “business as usual approach cannot be allowed to drag on”.
“Nobody can change God’s laws of physics. Further floods are guaranteed unless protection works are initiated,” he said.
Last Friday a review – commissioned by Melbourne Water into the flooding that affected more than 500 homes – found Rivervue remained a flood risk and that this could increase in the future as a result of climate change.
The review recommended Melbourne Water investigate how it came to be satisfied with the reduction of the flood levels and finished floor levels at the Rivervue retirement village under plans endorsed in 2009.
It also recommended improvements to forecasting and warning systems.
On Thursday, Korkliniewski said he received no emergency warnings on the day of the flood and recounted knocking on the doors of residents to alert them to the risk.

“Our haven was gone and we were left homeless,” he told the inquiry.
“It was the emotional trauma that cut deep. I saw faces filled with anguish, despair, people that lost everything.”
During the hearing, Korkliniewski also accused retirement village operator Tigcorp of under-insuring the site, leading some residents to pay large amounts of money for their own temporary accommodation.
The ABC previously reported Rivervue had a flood insurance limit of $5m, despite having more than $80m in assets. The operator reportedly said it would cover the shortfall for the “extensive reinstatement works” required in the village
Korkliniewski told the inquiry he had asked the retirement village to disclose the insurance policy over “many years” and did not receive it.
“If purchasing I knew what the value of the insurance was I would then say to myself, hold on, $5m against $84m in assets as of October 2022 does not make sense.”
The inquiry on Wednesday heard that many homes along the Maribyrnong river would become uninsurable in the coming years, with premiums in some areas already doubling.
Melbourne Water has confirmed a flood management plan for the retirement village is being developed.

Australia’s information commissioner denies leadership ‘gaslighted’ former FoI chief,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/12/australia-freedom-of-information-commissioner-angelene-falk-former-chief-leo-hardiman-senate-inquiry,"Angelene Falk responds to Leo Hardiman’s extraordinary accusations to a Senate inquiry which he claimed led to his resignation
The information commissioner, Angelene Falk, has described allegations the watchdog’s leadership “gaslighted” the former FoI commissioner and presented a “false narrative” about FoI funding constraints as “disturbing” while dismissing other claims as untrue or misleading.The information watchdog responded to the extraordinary accusations made to a Senate inquiry by the former FoI commissioner Leo Hardiman in August, which he claimed had led to his resignation from the role just one year into a five-year term.Hardiman had made a series of claims about his short time in the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, including that his efforts to resolve the growing backlog of FoI requests were frustrated by leadership and that Falk had “intimidated” and gaslit him into providing more details about his resignation.
Hardiman also claimed the agency’s cultural problems were “entirely a product” of Falk’s leadership. In a 47-page submission responding to the claims, which was released on Thursday, Falk said she did not share Hardiman’s “recollection or characterisation of our working relationship, which I considered to be professional and respectful on my part”.“Mr Hardiman did not raise with me in direct terms, or in any substantive way, the issues and allegations outlined in his statement,” she said.
“Many of these were not raised with me at all. Nor did he convey that they were of such magnitude that he would take the serious step of resigning less than 12 months into a five-year term.“Mr Hardiman’s resignation, and the tone and substance of the evidence he has subsequently provided to this committee, have been disturbing.”

During his explosive evidence to the Senate in August, Hardiman also alleged that OAIC leadership treated its FoI work as of lesser importance than its role as a privacy regulator.
He suggested OAIC leadership ignored major problems causing the backlog in FoI decision reviews, instead promulgating false narratives about its funding constraints and its improvements in FoI work in recent years.
But Falk pushed back, saying the suggestion that FoI work was treated as secondary ignored the context within which the OAIC was operating. She said the government had compelled the agency to expand its remit as a privacy regulator and allocated it funding specifically for that purpose.
“The structure of the OAIC and allocation of resourcing are not the result of an internal ‘cultural bent’ which values privacy over FoI, but rather a necessary consequence of Parliament’s decision to confer expansive privacy regulatory functions on the OAIC, together with the government’s provision of specific funding to carry out these privacy functions,” she said.
She also rejected suggestions that the OAIC ignored the FoI backlog, saying there was a clearly defined strategy for dealing with it.
She also said claims that resources had been inappropriately diverted from FoI to the agency’s corporate area were “incorrect”.

Hardiman’s evidence to the Senate had also raised a serious allegation that the OAIC had allowed a false narrative to be presented to the federal court as it fought a case brought by the former senator Rex Patrick, which alleged delays to its FoI work were unlawful.
Hardiman said the OAIC had allowed the court to believe that it had no control over the resourcing available for its FoI work, despite him raising concerns internally about the accuracy of such a narrative.
Falk said it simply was not true that any “false narrative” existed or that “false or misleading evidence or submissions” were made to the federal court, and said Hardiman had not raised any internal concerns, despite being significantly involved in reviewing the OAIC’s submissions to the court.

She had been in hospital for four weeks prior to her death, Token management confirmed to Guardian Australia.On Wednesday night, friends and colleagues gathered at Melbourne’s Comedy Republic venue to pay tribute to Wilson. Online, many remembered her warm and generous personality – the hallmarks of a three-decade career that spanned 14 Melbourne international comedy festival shows, two children’s books and regular appearances on series including Thank God You’re Here, Whose Line Is it Anyway? and Spicks and Specks.“I was always relieved to see Cal,” fellow host and comedian Rhys Nicholson wrote on Instagram. “At very good gigs, very shit gigs, dinners, parties … You knew whatever was going on, it would at least be more funny, more warm and just more bloody silly because Cal was there.”Rove McManus called her a “shining soul … taken far far too soon from a world that adored her as much as she adored it”.

Cheng Lei: Australia’s foreign minister reveals the promise she made to jailed journalist’s children,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/12/cheng-lei-australian-journalist-children-family-foreign-minister-penny-wong-promise,"The day after Cheng arrived back in Australia after three years’ detention in China, Penny Wong says she had vowed to ‘do everything I could to bring her home’
The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has revealed she promised the children of the formerly jailed journalist Cheng Lei to “do everything I could to bring her home”.
Speaking a day after Cheng returned to Melbourne after three years in detention in China accused of ill-defined security-related allegations, Wong said the Australian journalist was “in extraordinarily good spirits” and was “pretty tough”.
“I think I was more emotional than she was,” Wong said on Thursday, as she described greeting Cheng at Melbourne airport the day before.
“It was really moving to meet Cheng Lei yesterday and to speak to her kids, who are not much older than mine. I made them a promise some time ago we would do everything, I would do everything I could, to bring her home, and it was wonderful to see them together.”
Wong said she hoped Cheng – a former business anchor for the state-owned China Global Television Network (CGTN) – was now “having some downtime with her family”. Cheng’s children are 12 and 14.
The breakthrough came after the Australian government repeatedly raised the case with the Chinese government. That included in all ministerial meetings and also when Anthony Albanese met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, last year and the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, last month.
Wong said she first raised Cheng’s case in her first meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, shortly after the 2022 election, and “made clear at that time that Australians wanted to see a mother reunited with her children”.

She said that advocacy had been “backed in by officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade” including the secretary, Jan Adams, and the Australian ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher, who accompanied Cheng on an Air China flight from Beijing on Wednesday.
“I wish her and her family well,” Wong said. “She asked what she could do for us and I said, ‘you can thrive – thrive and be healthy and happy – and that’s what all Australians want you to be’.”
Cheng posted a short message online on Wednesday evening: “Tight hugs, teary screams, holding my kids in the spring sunshine. Trees shimmy from the breeze. I can see the entirety of the sky now! Thank you Aussies.”
China’s national security body released a statement saying Cheng had been deported “in accordance with the law after serving her sentence” of two years and 11 months in prison.
“In May 2020, Cheng Lei was coaxed by personnel from an overseas agency, violated the confidentiality clause signed with the employing unit, and illegally provided the state secrets she mastered at work to the overseas agency through her mobile phone,” it said.
Cheng’s supporters have long maintained she is innocent, and Canberra had said the case lacked transparency and judicial fairness. Her trial was held in secret and no evidence against her has been publicly released or examined. China’s opaque judicial system has a conviction rate of more than 99.8%, and there is almost no transparency in national security cases.
Wong was reluctant to detail the negotiations that allowed Cheng to be released, but said the government appreciated “the arrangements which were made to bring her home”.
Peter Greste, the Australian journalist who was jailed in Egypt for 400 days until his release in 2015, said he was “more than elated” to hear that Cheng’s ordeal was “finally over”.
“As a former detainee myself, I well understand what she’s been through,” said Greste, now the executive director of the Alliance for Journalists’ Freedom.
Greste said Cheng’s case “was always shrouded in secrecy and the Chinese government never presented any clear evidence of wrongdoing”.

He said Cheng had shown “incredible courage, resilience and dignity – all qualities that I’m sure helped win her support around the world, and ultimately her freedom”.
The minister for home affairs, Clare O’Neil, told ABC TV: “I mean it’s been a week of complete darkness on the international news front, and this is just a moment of sunshine for all Australians.”
The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, gave plaudits to the Australian government for securing the release.
“Well done to the government and [it’s] so lovely to see Cheng Lei come home,” Ley told Nine’s Today program.
“We still remember that letter from her cell, only seeing a small amount of sunlight and she called it a love letter to 25 million Australians.
“So great work by our diplomats working so carefully behind the scenes as well.”
Ley urged the Chinese government to release others in detention, including the Australian writer Yang Hengjun, whose case the Albanese government has promised to continue to raise with Beijing.
The independent MP Sophie Scamps said Cheng’s release was “a big win”.
“I met her partner, Nick Coyle, earlier on in the year, just by chance, and it was such a deeply distressing time for that family and for Cheng to be separated from her children for three years,” Scamps told the Today program.
Elaine Pearson, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the case showed that “political cases need political pressure to be resolved”.
“Cheng Lei’s release is wonderful news for her and her family; she should never have spent one minute in prison let alone more than three years,” she said.
“Foreign governments like Australia should keep up the pressure and use every opportunity to press strongly for the release of all those arbitrarily detained in China.”

"PwC Australia blocked from breaking up business by global management in 2018, Senate inquiry hears",2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/12/pwc-australia-blocked-breaking-up-business-management-2018-senate-inquiry,"Former CEO Luke Sayers says ‘Project Kookaburra’ sought to sell off consultancy business amid concerns about conflicts of interests
PwC Australia recommended the firm be broken up to avoid conflicts of interest and address concerns about declining audit quality in 2018, but was blocked by the global executive, its former chief executive Luke Sayers has told an inquiry.
Sayers told a Senate inquiry that the firm’s Australian leadership had launched “Project Kookaburra”, a process aimed at having its consultancy business sold. Management was also concerned about the then ongoing royal commission into financial services, he said.
“As the chief executive officer of PwC Australia, I had significant concerns about the conflicts of interest inherent in a large professional services firm and said so,” said Sayers, who led the organisation from 2012 to 2020.
“In the final two years of my tenure, I strove to mitigate the risks associated with that and deliver fundamental structural reform. But I was unsuccessful.”
Sayers, who again denied any knowledge of his firm’s misuse of confidential Treasury information during his tenure as chief executive, said he was also “concerned about the audit quality” at the time.
After seeking advice from the inquiry chair about a non-disclosure agreement he signed with PwC Australia, Sayers said the executive team spent about 12 months considering a possible sell off to address their concerns.
“One of the recommendations that came out of that specific project was to divest the consulting business – not just the public sector consulting business, but the entire consulting business,” Sayers said.
Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup
The proposed sell-off would have allowed money from consultancy divisions to be redirected to its audit services. Sayers told the inquiry that he and a team had flown to New York to discuss the proposal with PwC’s global chairman, Robert Moritz.
“The decision was taken by global that, whilst understanding the complexity and the risks and so on and so forth, it was not pragmatic to sell a piece of global consulting here in Australia and not divest that elsewhere in other jurisdictions around the world,” Sayers said.
PwC Australia ultimately divested its government consultancy businesses to the private equity firm Allegro Funds for just $1, after a reputation crisis led to many government departments refusing to give it more work. Its private sector consultancy business has continued.
On Thursday, the federal finance department gave permission for PwC Australia contracts to be transferred over to the new spin-off company, Scyne Advisory.
The revelation is likely to add to calls to break up the big four consultancy firm, as advocated for by the former chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Allan Fels.
The Labor senator Deborah O’Neill told the inquiry that PwC Australia had, in previous submissions to the Senate, argued that “such a breakup was not a good idea and should never occur”.
“That makes me very much question the interactions of PwC with the Senate under your leadership,” O’Neill said.

“This was going on in one part of the business [while] the public documentation to the Senate was a denial that such a thing should ever occur because it would make the business unable to basically operate.”
The culture and practices of PwC Australia during Sayer’s tenure as chief executive have been criticised by senators running the inquiry. On Thursday, Sayers offered another apology.
“The breaches of confidence and the failure to properly identify and address them happened on my watch and I sincerely apologise,” Sayers said.
PwC Australia’s current chief executive, Kevin Burrowes, also apologised to the Senate while confirming six international partners were facing investigations for not raising the alarm when they received confidential government information.
“Six of our partners around the world were found to have not asked the questions they should have done in connection with the confidentiality breaches,” Burrowes said. “The firms in which they reside are taking appropriate action against them.”
The inquiry’s chair, Liberal senator Richard Colbeck, said he was personally offended by PwC Australia’s conduct and expressed alarm about an internal investigation led by former Telstra executive, Ziggy Switkowski.
“It was almost depressing every time I started a new section of the report because it basically reinforced at each level how crap things were inside your business. I mean, it was just terrible,” Colbeck said during the hearing.
Burrowes did not dispute Colbeck’s assessment and said: “The situation is deeply disappointing and Dr Switkowski’s review is very difficult for us to read.”

Australian women suing Qatar Airways after invasive body searches criticise ‘disappointing’ Senate report,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/12/australian-women-suing-qatar-airways-over-invasive-body-searches-criticise-disappointing-senate-report,"Inquiry into rejection of airline’s request for extra flights was too focused on Qantas, complainants say
Australian women suing Qatar Airways after a “horrific” experience at Doha airport have criticised a Senate report into the airline’s blocked push for extra flights, claiming the investigation focused too much on Alan Joyce and Qantas, without holding the Qatari carrier to account.
On Monday the Senate select committee on bilateral air service agreements – set up to examine the rejection of Qatar Airways’ request to almost double its flights into Australia’s major airports – released its report, urging the Albanese government to immediately review its decision.
Through a month of hearings the inquiry examined questions about Qantas’s influence on the transport minister Catherine King’s decision – including grilling the airline’s new boss, Vanessa Hudson, and threatening her predecessor Joyce with jail if he failed to appear at a later date after his return from overseas – as well as broader accusations of anti-competitive behaviour and high airfares.
The inquiry also canvassed the significance of an October 2020 episode at Doha airport, when female passengers were forced from planes at gunpoint and subjected to non-consensual invasive bodily inspections as authorities searched for the mother of a baby abandoned in a bathroom.

Five Australian women are taking legal action against Qatar Airways, its subsidiary that owns Doha airport and the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority. Marque Lawyers, the firm representing the women, have complained of a lack of cooperation from the Qatari parties and criticised their failure to directly apologise to the women.
King revealed her intention to block the airline’s request for more routes in July, when responding to a letter that the women had sent her pleading not to grant the carrier extra rights. In the months of controversy that followed, she stressed their treatment was only one factor that provided context to the decision, amid a range of “national interest” considerations.
Qatar Airways representatives told the inquiry such treatment would not be repeated and in the committee’s report on Monday the recommendations focused on reviewing the decision and better considering consumers, as well as noting that Qatar Airways had helped repatriate Australians during the pandemic and from Afghanistan in 2021.
The inquiry, led by the Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie, became politically charged, with King refusing to appear. Labor and Greens members issued dissenting reports, with the government labelling the Senate report a “political stunt”.
Now the women behind the legal action have criticised the report for failing to hold Qatar Airways to account for its handling “of the horrific incident”. The women have backed Labor’s dissenting report, saying: “Qatar Airways is not a good corporate citizen and is not entitled to improved landing rights.”
Anna*, one of the women behind the legal action, told Guardian Australia that their case had not gained fair attention until it was linked to the government’s decision to knock back Qatar Airways’ request.
“It has just turned into a political storm about Alan Joyce and Qantas and it has been very upsetting for me and the whole group,” she said.
“We’ve never received an apology from the airport or the government, they’ve never reached out to us. There was a public apology issued once, but that’s it.”
At a court hearing in August, lawyers for the airline argued that the searches were actions of police, not of airline or airport staff. Meanwhile, the Qatari regulator was seeking a stay on the basis of sovereign immunity.
Anna said the airline was “aggressively defending” the legal proceedings.
“We were very happy when Minister King refused them extra rights, when she says the national interest, we understood this as she stood by us. The national interest is the citizens of this country … what other interest could they have?”

“We were extremely disappointed to read the [Senate] report. It was very hard to read, there was no proper mention of what they did to us.”
Framing the rejection of the airline’s push for more flights as supporting Qantas and making airfares higher as a result had left them feeling “without support”.
“I am someone who has to travel overseas to see my family, I would like cheaper flights too, I understand this,” Anna said. “But Qatar needs to answer us, and our government is the one who can force them to answer.”
Marque’s Damian Sturzaker, who representing the women, said the political nature of the Senate inquiry and the focus on Qantas “certainly minimised” the women’s ordeal, paying only “lip service” to their plight.
“There was criticism of Alan Joyce not appearing, and yet the CEO of Qatar Airways didn’t appear,” he said.
“A good corporate citizen recognises when a mistake has been made and ensures that the people affected by that mistake are compensated and given an apology. Qatar has done neither of these things,” Sturzaker said.
McKenzie acknowledged the women’s criticism, but defended the committee’s report and inquiry, saying it had “expressed its deep concern at the appalling and unacceptable incident”.
She said government officials “informed the committee that the Qatari Government had prosecuted those responsible, had apologised and ‘repeatedly assured’ such an appalling incident would not happen again”.

"Tesla fined $155,460 by Australian consumer watchdog over button battery safety breaches",2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/12/tesla-fined-accc-button-battery-safety-breaches,"ACCC alleges Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company failed to conduct required safety tests for some key fob and illuminated door sill models
Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company, Tesla, has been fined $155,460 for failing to comply with mandatory safety standards for products using button batteries, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has said.
The fine – just over the cost of two Tesla Model 3 vehicles – was levied by the regulator over Tesla allegedly failing to conduct the required safety tests for three of its key fob models and two of its illuminated door sill models. It was also fined for allegedly failing to provide the mandatory safety warnings on these products, which have been required since June last year.

The button and coin battery standards stipulate that the batteries must be secure in the product they are powering, and if replaceable, they must be in a secure battery compartment that is resistant to being opened by young children.
The ACCC said children can be attracted to button batteries and swallow them or insert them into their nostrils, which can cause chemical burns and potentially injure vital organs. There have been three reported deaths of children in Australia from inserting or ingesting button batteries.
“Button batteries can be lethal for young children, and the Australian mandatory standards are designed to reduce the risk of injury through testing of the safety of products containing them before they are sold, and explicit warnings on the packaging of the products,” the ACCC’s deputy chair, Catriona Lowe, said.

“Any failure to test these products before they are sold poses an unacceptable risk to children. We expect all companies, large and small, to comply with the mandatory button battery standards to ensure children are protected from the dangers of button batteries.”
In the period between 22 June 2022, and 30 May 2023, Tesla sold 952 of the various devices for its cars. Tesla removed the products from sale when the ACCC began investigating, and has since found the Model 3/Y and Model X key fobs to comply with the standards. The ACCC said testing is continuing for the other products, and supply will recommence once the test results are obtained.
The ACCC said some of the fobs were shaped like a car, which would have likely increased their appeal to small children.
Guardian Australia has sought comment from Tesla.
The regulator said Tesla customers concerned about their products should contact the company.

Sydney pro-Palestine march replaced with ‘static demonstration’ at Hyde Park ,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/12/sydney-pro-palestine-march-rally-replaced-static-demonstration-hyde-park,"Organisers say they will still be ‘loud and proud’ on Sunday but have changed plans after premier Chris Minns vowed to stop any protests
A planned pro-Palestine march through the streets of Sydney on Sunday has been scrapped in favour of a “static demonstration” at Hyde Park after the premier, Chris Minns, vowed to stop any marches.
Event co-organiser Amal Naser said the decision had been made to avoid dealing with legal issues related to obtaining police protection for a march.
“We’ll be holding a static demonstration. We’re going to be out, loud and proud and we’re not going to bow down to the pressures that we’ve been experiencing from police and the premier,” she said on Thursday.
“We have full intention to march next week and every week after that as long as we need.”
Naser said New South Wales police had informed organisers they were “very unlikely” to have an application for future rallies approved. She vowed to launch a challenge in the supreme court if needed.
She said the demonstration was being held “in solidarity with the Palestinian people for what’s happening in Gaza right now”. She expected there to be speeches from activists and politicians.
Minns on Wednesday vowed to stop further pro-Palestinian marches after he’d earlier apologised for allowing Monday night’s event that ended with antisemitic slurs being hurled on the steps of the Sydney Opera House.
The globally recognised Sydney venue had been lit up blue and white in support of Israel and the protesters had been allowed to march from town hall to the steps of the venue by police before the chanting and flare-throwing began.

“I really want to make it clear to the Jewish community that I want to apologise to them specifically, on behalf of the government and myself as the premier of NSW,” Minns said.
Video from the protest showed men chanting offensive slogans including “fuck the Jews” and “fuck Israel”. Event organisers claimed the troublemakers were few in number and had not been part of the broader event.
Minns has said he wanted to ensure what unfolded on Monday couldn’t happen again. He said the protesters had already “proven they’re not peaceful” and “the idea that they’re going to commandeer Sydney streets is not going to happen”.
The premier conceded he had not spoken to anyone from the Palestinian community in NSW.
Det Supt Jodi Radmore on Thursday warned that anyone acting illegally would be “dealt with”.
“If you want to come into the city or into any of our parks anywhere in NSW and commit an offence, you will be dealt with,” she said. Radmore refused to comment on the specifics of the Sunday plan.
The energy minister, Penny Sharpe, said the government had made it “very clear” that people should not participate in what she said would be an “unauthorised” rally on Sunday.

She warned that anyone who attended the event and did “the wrong thing” would feel “the full force of the law”.
Asked whether the rally could be “unauthorised” if it involved people gathering in a park, Sharpe said on Thursday: “Let’s not get into semantics here.”
“It’s pretty clear they applied to do a rally. That has been rejected. This gathering is now an unauthorised gathering,” she said.
Anyone planning a protest on public roads or spaces in NSW is generally required to apply to police at least seven days before the event for it to be classified as authorised.
Approval provides organisers and attendees protection from certain laws and a police presence.
Sharpe said the Hamas attack on Israel was “absolutely abhorrent” and she had a message for everyone who supported peace and was dealing with “a very difficult situation”.
“There are very good people across NSW and the actions of a few, particularly terrorists, should not be conflated with the good people of NSW and the Palestinian community in NSW”.
The NSW police deputy commissioner, David Hudson, had said the rally planned for Sunday would be “unauthorised” and announced police had formed Operation Shelter to deal with further protests and safety concerns within the Jewish community.
Hudson said the police “do not have the powers to stop people attending” but people who attended would not have the usual protections from being charged with obstructing traffic and other offences. Those comments were made before the organisers changed their plans on Thursday.

Greens say Melbourne housing towers should be fixed amid claims that would be ‘putting lipstick on a pig’,2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/12/melbourne-public-housing-towers-demolition-refurbishing,"Homes Victoria says maintaining the 44 towers would cost $2.3bn over 20 years but Greens say some estates are already being refurbished
The Greens have questioned why 44 public housing towers slated for demolition in Melbourne could not have been refurbished, after Victoria’s housing agency chief said maintaining them would be akin to “putting lipstick on a pig”.
Homes Victoria has been forced to defend the government’s decision to rebuild the towers, amid fierce opposition from the Victorian Greens, with the agency saying maintaining the towers would cost $2.3bn over 20 years.
The project, announced by the government last month, will lift the number of residents living on the sites from roughly 10,000 to 30,000. The government says it will lift the number of social homes by 10%, though it is unclear exactly how many of the new units will be public, social and market-rate dwellings. The cost of the project has also not been released.
Speaking at the last hearing of the rental affordability inquiry on Tuesday, the Homes Victoria chief executive, Simon Newport, said refurbishing the towers would be like “putting lipstick on a pig”.
“The program is projected to run for 27 to 28 years. Some of the towers could be 80 years of age,” Newport said.
“The construction methodology, ceiling heights that don’t permit services to run between floors, no heating, no cooling, no balconies, it’s difficult to clean windows. All of those factors were taken into account.”

He said just maintaining the apartments to their current state would cost $2.3bn, roughly $55m per tower, over the next 20 years, though the government has not released that modelling.
“In terms of the sites, they’re done in terms of asset condition. I would point out our tenants are overwhelmingly telling us this,” he said. “It’s taking up to 20 offers to get people to come and move to these towers.”
The towers currently house 5,800 families but he said because they are not suitable for many people with disability, they were often offered several times to people on the waiting list before a suitable tenant was found.
Newport said many of them had issues, such as being retrofitted with sprinklers, which flood the elevators when they are triggered, forcing residents to use the stairwell – which could mean descending 22 floors in some cases.
“Heating and cooling are an issue,” he said. “Those properties were designed in the 50s and built in the late 50s. Their time is well past.”
But the Greens state party leader, Samantha Ratnam, has said the plan could herald “the end of public housing in the state”, with public land being sold off to private developers. She questioned why the government could refurbish some apartments, such as the Atherton Gardens estate in Fitzroy, but not others.

“In recent years several towers across Fitzroy and Richmond have been undergoing extensive renovations, with many floors already completed,” Ratnam said. “Yet now Labor appears to be abandoning this so they can kick out residents, demolish the towers and sell off most of the land.
“The government needs to stop this disastrous plan and take responsibility for ensuring Victorians have secure and genuinely affordable housing by building 100,000 new public homes – not destroying the ones we have.”
A spokesperson for the government said the Greens were “fighting against new housing”.
“Over the past 20 years an ongoing upgrade program has refurbished the apartments in the towers – but the age, overall constraints and condition of the buildings mean they no longer meet liveability standards,” the spokesperson said.
Among public housing advocates, there has been mixed response to the proposal, with the Victorian Public Tenants Association saying it was a step in the right direction but calling on the government to be transparent about who will manage the properties.
The Council to Homeless Persons chief executive, Deborah Di Natale, said the government had missed a “critical opportunity” to tackle the housing crisis.
“We need at least 60,000 new public and community homes to be built in Victoria over a decade. Unfortunately there’s nothing like that in these announcements,” Di Natale said.

"Indigenous boy, 16, in critical condition after being found unresponsive at WA youth prison",2023-10-12,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/12/teenage-boy-16-unresponsive-wa-youth-prison-casuarina-perth-hospital,"Boy resuscitated at Casuarina prison before being taken to Perth’s Sir Charles Gairdner hospital
A 16-year-old boy detained at Casuarina prison’s Unit 18 youth detention facility in Western Australia is in a critical condition after he was found unresponsive at the facility.
The 16-year-old, who is Indigenous, contacted officers via intercom, and within a matter of minutesofficers found him unresponsive, according to the state’s minister for corrective services, Paul Papalia.
The officers commenced resuscitation and were able to regain a pulse, Papalia said.

Unit 18 is a separate youth facility within the maximum-security Casuarina men’s prison, converted in July 2022 to hold juvenile detainees after riots at the Banksia Hill youth detention centre.
St John Ambulance said they were called to Casuarina prison’s Unit 18, and the boy was transported to Sir Charles Gairdner hospital under priority one condition.
“I understand [the officers] have conducted themselves exceptionally well in confronting, very confronting circumstances,” Papalia said.
The premier, Roger Cook, said staff commenced resuscitation immediately at 2am on Thursday before three medical teams arrived.
“This is an incredibly regrettable situation. It’s deeply distressing and deeply saddening,” Cook said.
The incident will still be subject to investigation and some family members have not yet been notified of the situation, Papalia said.

He added said: “I’m thinking about the boy and hopeful that his condition will improve. But also thinking about the staff involved in the situation.”
Papalia said the government had made Banksia Hill safer. “Banksia Hill is better … because the most challenging, complex … juvenile detainees are housed in Unit 18.”

Joe Biden addressed a round table of Jewish leaders in Washington on Wednesday, where he described the bloody assault on Israel by Hamas as ""the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust”.
The US president said Saturday’s attack was “sheer evil” and a “campaign of pure cruelty against the Jewish people”.
“Silence is complicity,” Biden said. “I refuse to be silent”. He said he had spoken again today with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and that the US is “surging” additional military assistance to the Israel Defense Forces.
He said the US was “working on every aspect” of the hostage crisis in Israel, but that “the idea that I’m going to stand here before you and tell you what I’m doing is bizarre”.
This blog is closing. We have launched a new blog at the link below with the latest:
If you’re just joining us: US President Joe Biden warned Iran against getting involved in Israel‘s conflict with Hamas amid fears of a wider regional conflict, while ongoing Israeli air strikes around the Gaza Strip drove hundreds of thousands from their homes.
Israeli jets have pounded Gazan targets for days in retribution for a weekend attack by Hamas militants who breached the border fence enclosing the enclave and rampaged through towns and villages, killing 1,200 people, injuring over 2,700, and taking scores of hostages, the Israeli military said.At around 4:30 a.m. on Thursday, Israel’s military said it was conducting a “large-scale strike” on targets belonging to Hamas in Gaza. It did not provide details.The death toll in Gaza has risen to 1,200, with around 5,600 wounded, Palestinian media reported, citing Gaza’s health ministry.Biden despatched his top diplomat, Antony Blinken, to the Middle East to show Washington’s enduring support for Israel, seek to secure the release of captives, including Americans, and prevent a wider war from erupting.Blinken will arrive on Thursday and will also visit Jordan, but will not visit the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where he ordinarily meets Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
The death toll of Thai citizens in Israel has risen to 21, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin posted on social media platform X on Thursday.
China’s special envoy on Middle East issues is expected to have a telephone conversation with Israeli officials on Thursday, Israel’s Ambassador to China, Irit Ben-Abba, told Bloomberg News.China will likely talk about the meeting later in the afternoon, during a regular briefing held by the foreign ministry, the report said.China’s foreign ministry could not immediately be reached for comment.
Here is more detail from the phone call between Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, via Reuters.
The pair discussed the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on Wednesday, in the first telephone call between the two leaders since a China-brokered deal between Tehran and Riyadh to resume ties.The two leaders’ call came as Israel carried out air strikes in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a deadly attack by Palestinian Hamas militants in Israel.Raisi and the Saudi crown prince discussed the “need to end war crimes against Palestine,” Iranian state media said.The Saudi crown prince, for his part, “affirmed that the Kingdom is making all possible efforts in communicating with all international and regional parties to stop the ongoing escalation,” Saudi state news agency SPA said.He also reiterated Saudi Arabia’s rejection of targeting civilians in any way, SPA added.Asked about Raisi’s call with the crown prince, a senior US State Department official said Washington, which staunchly backs Israel in its fight against Hamas, was in “constant contact with Saudi leaders”.The official added that the US was asking its partners with channels or relations with Hamas, Lebanon’s Hezbollah or Iran “to get Hamas to stand down from its attacks, to release hostages, keep Hezbollah out (and) keep Iran out of the fray.”
Israel’s bombing campaign has destroyed or rendered uninhabitable at least 2,540 housing units in Gaza, OCHA said, citing numbers from the Gaza Ministry of Public Works and Housing.
Another 22,850 housing units sustained moderate to minor damage, it said.
The UN agency also voiced alarm at the significant destruction of civilian infrastructure damaged in the shelling.
Among other things, it said sewage facilities serving more than a million people had been hit by air strikes, leaving solid waste accumulating in the streets, posing a health threat.
More than 338,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in the Gaza Strip, the United Nations said, as heavy Israeli bombardments continue to hit the Palestinian enclave.
“Mass displacement across the Gaza Strip continues,” the UN humanitarian agency OCHA said in a statement sent on Thursday.
By late Wednesday, the number of displaced people in Gaza had risen by an additional 75,000 people from the figure given 24 hours earlier, reaching 338,934, it said.
Israeli forces said 1,200 people, most of them civilians, were killed in the onslaught - the worst in the country’s history.
In Gaza, officials reported more than 1,100 people have been killed in Israel’s sustained campaign of air and artillery strikes.
OCHA said nearly 220,000 people, or two-thirds of the displaced people, have sought shelter in schools run by the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
Another nearly 15,000 people fled to schools run by the Palestinian Authority, while more than 100,000 were being sheltered by relatives, neighbours and a church and other facilities in Gaza City.
“We have a long and very, very dangerous road ahead of us,” says Conricus as he ends the briefing.
A ground offensive will be launched on Gaza “when opportune and fit for our purposes”, IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus has just said in a live update.
Ground forces are gathering at Israel’s southern border with Gaza.
IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus is giving a live update. He is discussing the tunnels under the Gaza strip, and says that the Air Force is trying to attack those.
He claims that the IDF is “prioritising striking Hamas commanders”.
Reports from Gaza suggest that hundreds of civilians, including children, have died in IDF strikes.
Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus is speaking now. He says that 100 bodies, including those of children and infants, have been recovered in Kibbutz Be’eri. The total population of the kibbutz before the attack was about 1,200 people.
The IDF has posted to X, saying, “The IDF is now launching an extensive attack on many centers of the terrorist organization Hamas in the Gaza Strip.”
While we wait for that IDF update to begin, here is some analysis on where Saudi Arabi and Iran stand.
Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler and Iran’s president spoke by phone about the war between Israel and Hamas, Saudi state media said early Thursday,
Analysts say the war has dealt a heavy blow to a possible landmark normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia, home to the holiest sites in Islam, and Israel.
That process has been driven by US President Joe Biden’s administration, with Riyadh bargaining hard for benefits from Washington including security guarantees and help developing a civilian nuclear programme.
Iran has long financially and militarily backed Hamas but insists it had no involvement in Saturday’s assault.
Saudi Arabia and Iran announced in March they had agreed to restore ties, ending a seven-year rupture in a deal brokered by China.
Prince Mohammed also spoke by phone on Wednesday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, during which the 38-year-old Saudi leader said he was “exerting unremitting efforts through regional and international communication to achieve coordination that pushes for a halt of the current escalation”.
We are expecting a briefing from Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus to begin shortly and will bring you the key updates as they happen.
More now from the AP report on the hostages being held by Hamas:
The unique nature of the crisis does contain advantages for Israel, said Gershon Baskin, who helped to negotiate the 2011 release of an Israeli sergeant from Hamas, because there are so many captives, information about some of their locations might leak, even though they are likely dispersed around the territory in homes or underground, he said. That could favour rescue operations.
AP:
Israel has historically made big concessions to win freedom for hostages. The fate of prisoners is emotionally charged on the Palestinian side, too most Palestinians have either spent time in an Israeli jail or know someone who did.
But as Israel’s military strikes Gaza with unprecedented ferocity, it’s not clear whether the safety of hostages is playing a role in decision-making. At least one member of the government, the hardline Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also plays a role in the Defense Ministry, was quoted as demanding Saturday that the military “hit Hamas brutally and not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration.”
Reports of Egyptian, Turkish and Qatari mediation efforts don’t appear to be going anywhere. More than 1,200 Israelis were killed in Hamas’s incursion, so Baskin doesn’t expect Israel to engage in a negotiated deal that would reward the militant group.
In Israel, he said, “no one has the appetite to give Hamas any kind of prize.”
As far as we know, Hamas has not made specific demands for the release of hostages, but the release of Palestinian prisoners may be one of the demands.
On 7 October, the day of the Hamas attack on Israel, Al Jazeera spoke to the deputy chief of Hamas’s political bureau, Saleh al-Arouri, who said, “Our detainees in [Israeli] prisons, their freedom is looming large. What we have in our hands will release all our prisoners. The longer fighting continues, the higher the number of prisoners will become.”
By “what we have in our hands”, al-Arouri appeared to be referring to hostages.
Al Jazeera reported that, according to the latest figures by Addameer, a prisoners’ rights NGO, nearly 5,200 Palestinians are in Israeli jails.
The Associated Press has taken a look at the logistics behind any potential rescue of hostages from Gaza.
It reports: The Hamas-run Gaza Strip is a tiny enclave, surveilled continually by Israel, surrounded by its guns. But rescuing — or even locating — more than 150 hostages hustled there by Palestinian militants who overran Israel’s southern border on Saturday will be a daunting task.
Gaza’s densely populated terrain, its network of underground tunnels and the sheer numbers of men, women and children taken captive present Israel with the most complex hostage crisis that the country has ever faced.
Mounting rescue operations in the midst of the massive Israeli bombardment of Gaza that followed the deadly Hamas rampage in southern Israel would only make an already difficult mission even more formidable.
“The situation is unprecedented,” said Gershon Baskin, who helped to negotiate the 2011 release of Staff Sergeant Gilad Schalit after more than five years of Hamas captivity. “I think Hamas was surprised at the ease it was able to take hostages. Israel was completely bewildered by everything that’s happened.”
The White House has clarified US president Joe Biden’s comments earlier, where he said, “I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children.”
In comments reported by the Washington Post, a White House spokesperson said that neither US officials nor Biden had seen photographs or confirmed such reports independently and that Biden had “based his comments about the alleged atrocities on the claims from Netanyahu’s spokesman,” the Washington Post reports.

51 people have died and 281 have been injured in Israeli air strikes on Gaza in the last hour, Al Jazeera reports, citing the Palestinian Health Ministry.
“The ministry said the strikes hit Sabra, Al Zaytoun, Al Nafaq and Tal Al Hawa. A separate report said Gaza’s Khan Younis was also hit by air strikes. Search and rescue operations are reportedly under way,” Al Jazeera reports.

Israel’s darkest day: the 24 hours of terror that shook the country,2023-10-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/13/israel-darkest-day-24-hours-of-terror-hamas-gaza,"
As dawn broke last Saturday over the 40-mile Gaza-Israel barrier, once confidently described as an “iron wall”, Hamas struck at the eyes and ears of Israel’s defence. It was shortly before 6.30am at the end of a Sukkot week of holiday when explosive devices, dropped from above by drones, made a mockery of past claims of impregnability by disabling the wall’s communication towers and its remote-controlled machine gun posts, while snipers picked off sensors and cameras, blinding Israeli defenders, left staring at blank screens, to what was in deadly motion.
Unseen in the weak light of early morning and unheard under the roar of the first of about 2,200 rockets fired towards southern and central Israel, Hamas fighters used wire cutters to make discreet punctures in the 20ft-tall (6 metres) double fence barrier or detonated small explosive loads to create larger openings.
It allowed their best trained men to scramble across on motorbikes and pickup trucks, their wheels churning up dust, as they embarked on a murderous search for the closest Israeli soldiers.
The shock troops from the military wing of Hamas, known as the Qassam brigades, bristling with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, were followed by bulldozers and hundreds more armed men, many on foot, swarming through 30 breaches of the defensive line.
Some of the Hamas militants, showing a taste for the spectacular, flew over on motorised paragliders – terror on wings. A total of 1,500 gunmen are believed to have crossed, under a sky lit by rocket fire.
“We have decided to put an end to all of the occupation’s crimes,” announced Hamas’s military commander, Mohammed Deif. “The time is over for them to act without accountability. Thus, we announce the al-Aqsa deluge.”
Over the last week, hours of footage has been shared on social media, taken from security cameras, car dashcams and the phones of terrorists and victims alike, providing an uncomfortably clear picture of how Israel’s darkest day unfolded.
What has become evident is that those charged with protecting Israel were hopelessly unprepared.
As of Friday, 1,300 residents of Israel have been killed, including 247 soldiers, while the Israeli government claims to have killed about 1,500 Hamas fighters on its territory and more than 1,500 people have died in the Gaza Strip.
A surge of communications activity on militant networks in Gaza had been picked up earlier that Saturday by Israeli intelligence. In combination with a general warning from the Egyptian security services of an impending event, the information could have saved lives.
Two telephone consultations had been held overnight between Israel’s southern security services, the Israel Defence Forces Intelligence Corps, the operations division and southern command with the knowledge of the IDF chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. It was decided that they were just picking up chatter around a paramilitary exercise and that the alert level need not raise.
Three observation balloons used to monitor the Gaza border had broken down in the past few weeks and they had not been replaced. Israel had relaxed its guard.
It was a catastrophic miscalculation. Plans and maps found on the bodies of Hamas fighters show that they knew the numbers of soldiers they might meet, how long it would take for local reinforcements to arrive, and from where.
Their orders were to kill and to take hostages “for negotiations”.
The closest machine gun posts were cleared with grenades within minutes of the wall being breached. At sea, a motorboat carrying Hamas commandos headed at pace to Zikim, an Israeli coastal town just north of the Gaza Strip that hosts the Bahad 4 base, where new IDF recruits were undergoing their basic training.
The Israeli navy managed to cut off at least one of the boats but already by 7am the Zikim base had been overrun by land.
The manning of such bases had been cut down over the years based on a misplaced confidence that the iron wall had their backs.
“I deeply care for all of you,” wrote Cpl Naama Boni, a 19-year-old soldier serving in the 77th Battalion of the Armoured Corps, to friends and family. “I have a head injury, and a terrorist nearby might start shooting at me. I am currently with an injured soldier from the Golani Brigade, and there are no reinforcements available.”
It was 7.30am. Boni would not survive. Zikim was one of 11 military bases to come under attack that morning, four of which were overrun.
Video footage taken by Hamas fighters showed how young men and women were slain as they tried to hide in toilet cubicles, bedrooms and cupboards.
As Boni in Zikim was typing out her last messages, a Hamas paraglider was cruising above the heads of 4,000 people dancing, drinking and laughing at the Supernova festival, south from her and 3.7 miles east of Gaza, close to the Re’im kibbutz.
Small plumes of black smoke had appeared in the sky from defensive missiles used by the Israeli military to intercept rockets fired from Gaza. At first, few of the partygoers – who had been promised a “journey of unity and love” by organisers – were concerned by the smoke or by the man buzzing above them, perhaps reckoning it was all part of the event.
Then the sirens went off. The music stopped. Almost immediately the crack of gunfire was heard. Terror followed.
The local armed security was overwhelmed by fire from all directions. Stalking among the partygoers, Hamas gunmen ran amok, firing with abandon at “anything with a pulse”, one witness said. Some tried to get to their cars to escape but those who made it on to the main road faced armed men farther down the line, guns raised, murder on their minds.
Others attempted to flee in vehicles or by foot across the fields on the other side of the main access road, aiming to reach the woods on the horizon. Sniper fire whistled around them. Some of the Hamas militants took chase, pursuing for miles from the festival site, through orchards and dusty fields, looking for a kill.
Those easy to snatch, such as Noa Argamani, 25, and her boyfriend, Avinatan Or, were hustled away at gunpoint. “Don’t kill me! No, no, no,” Argamani pleaded as she was driven away on the back of a bike. Her boyfriend was marched down a dirt path, destination unknown.
Video footage timed at 9.23am captured just one horrific moment among many during the carnage: a Hamas gunman firing close to one young man before leading him away. A second Israeli, lying by a car, possibly injured and certainly playing dead, lifted his head momentarily. It was the last thing he would do.
A second Hamas fighter casually shot a round into his prostrate body. Others later took his belongings.
An estimated 260 partygoers were murdered. Tens more could be among the 150 Israeli hostages believed to have been taken back to Gaza during the day. A video emerged of Shani Louk, 23, lifeless in the back of a truck, spat upon by Hamas fighters, legs unnaturally bent and her hair matted with blood.
It took minutes for Hamas to reach the closest Israeli settlements to the Gaza Strip, communal gatherings known as kibbutzim.
The timings of the horror can be recounted precisely thanks to video released by a Telegram channel called South First Responders. A camera caught the arrival of two armed men at the Be’eri kibbutz at 6.55am. They attempted to lift the security gate but then hid themselves as a blue Mazda pulled up.
The gate lifted, at which point those inside the car were shot dead. Later footage at 10.06am shows Hamas militants pulling two dead men from the car and looting their bodies. They were two of 118 to die in Be’eri. A mobile phone is taken. One corpse is later thrown into the back of a white SUV and driven away.
Where video footage is missing, gripping testimony fills the gap. In Nirim, another kibbutz, with a population of 400 people, Eldad Hess, a 38-year-old civil engineer, was woken at 6.30am by rockets. He and his wife, Goldi, took their two-year-old son, Uri, to the reinforced concrete shelter where their older children, Avigail, seven, and four-year-old Yotam, were sleeping, and swung the steel door shut.
At first, Hess thought it was just another rocket attack – a “wake-up alarm” from Gaza to mark Sukkot. But the alarm on their phones would not stop vibrating. Then the family heard explosions. “Ten minutes later we heard automatic rifle shots outside the house,” he said. “I understood what was happening but in my heart I couldn’t believe what was happening.”
A barrage of WhatsApp messages arrived from neighbours, confirming that shots – and shouting in Arabic – had been heard all over the kibbutz. Hess realised he needed to lock the door.
The problem was that the door could still be opened from the outside – a precaution the family had taken to stop the children locking themselves in the shelter.
“All I had to keep the door closed was my muscles and my will to live,” Hess said. A few minutes later, the family heard voices and shots inside the house. Multiple attempts were made by the Hamas fighters to get in. They failed – but killed the family’s nextdoor neighbours instead, including a 17-year-old girl.
In Nir Oz kibbutz, a number of people, including Doron Asher Katz, 34, and her young daughters, and 85-year-old Yafa Adar, were taken hostage and paraded and videoed by their captors
In Kfar Aza, the largest kibbutz in the northern area of the Gaza border, where 750 Israelis lived just 800 metres from the iron wall, reports emerged of babies being killed in their cots.
On Friday, the Israeli government published images including one of the corpse of a baby. Its clothes were spattered in blood.
With cellular communications at the wall down, the scale of the assault had not been immediately clear in Tel Aviv, but at 6.29am the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was updated on some worrying movements, and by 8.23am the state of Israel was on a war footing, with reservists called to arms.
In Gaza there too was a dawning realisation. The operation had been kept to a tight circle. Few knew to what it amounted but the potential repercussions swiftly became obvious to the average man and woman on the street.
“We were ecstatic. It’s like a dream that is hard to wake up from,” said Maha, 34, from Gaza City, in a call with Haaretz about the first reports of the incursion into Israel by Palestinian fighters. “But as the picture became clearer and I saw that there were Israeli prisoners, I realised that we were in a nightmare, in hell,” she said.
The first Israeli strikes on Gaza were at 10.34am. It would be the first of thousands on a thin stretch of land containing 2.2 million people. “Citizens of Israel, we are at war. Not an operation, not a round – at war,” Netanyahu announced in a first statement to the nation at 11.35am. “The enemy will pay an unprecedented price.”
Within two hours, 21 buildings said to house Hamas’s military operations had been flattened. Troops were sent to the south of Israel to rescue those in the settlements who had survived the Hamas onslaught.
It would take days more to secure them. “There were burnt cars and broken windows,” Hess said of his family’s escape from their shelter in Nir Oz under Israeli protection late on Saturday. “What we saw was a war zone. There’s no other word for it. And then we had to run for our lives.”
The US president, Joe Biden, gave Netanyahu full backing for his military response in a call at 6.08pm and publicly offered “all appropriate means of support”. The rhetoric from the Israeli government hardened by the hour.
Netanyahu made a second statement to the nation at 10.16pm. Gaza was “the city of evil”, he said. “We will turn all the places where Hamas is organised and hiding into cities of ruins. I say to the residents of Gaza: get out of there now. We will act everywhere and with all our strength.”
At 2.19am on Sunday, the prime minister told his nation that all of the sites used to launch the day’s attacks had been wiped from the earth. But Israel had just begun. The “offensive formation” phase was under way.

"Sunak’s approval rating against Starmer as best PM at record low after conferences, poll suggests –as it happened",2023-10-13,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/oct/13/grant-shapps-israel-gaza-city-government-uk-politics-latest-updates,"This live blog is now closed, you can read more of our UK political coverage here 
YouGov has released polling today that implies Rishi Sunak has failed to gain any electoral benefit from party conference season.
The survey results, published by the Times, suggest that on the question of who would be the best PM, Sunak has his lowest rating against Keir Starmer since he took office. The poll also suggests Labour has had a two-point boost from conference week, with the party on 47%, and the Conservatives on 24%.

As Oliver Wright reports in his Times story, the polling suggests voters are more likely to think Starmer has a plan for the country than Sunak, and more likely to see Labour as the party that would bring change. This is significant because Sunak’s main argument in his conference speech was that he, not Starmer, was the person best qualified to bring change. Wright says:
Asked whether they thought Starmer had a clear plan for the country, 28 per cent of voters said that he did — up six points on last week. This compared with 19 per cent who said that Sunak had a clear plan, down two points.
On the question of whether a Labour government would make a significant change, 47 per cent agreed that it would, compared with 37 per cent who said it would not. Only 25 per cent said that Sunak’s plans would represent a change — down five points in a week.
Labour may be concerned by one finding from the survey, which found that one of its main conference policy announcements, changing planning rules to make it easier for more homes to be built, even if that involves ignoring local opposition, does not have majority support. As Wright reports, the polling results depend on how the question is framed, but more than 40% of people do not seem to be in favour.
Forty per cent backed Labour’s plan to loosen planning laws to build new towns, and 43 per cent were opposed. Forty-seven per cent backed building more homes in their own areas, against 42 per cent who were opposed.
But the poll also found that Labour’s plan to cut hospital waiting lists by paying staff to work more overtime was popular, with 81% in favour and only 12% against.

Scotland Yard has recorded a “massive increase” in the number of suspected antisemitic offences in the capital compared with this time last year, as two more Jewish faith schools in north London close over security concerns.
Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has said he fears a “disproportionate” response by Israel to the attacks by Hamas could lead to “inexplicable” suffering in Gaza. (See 2.25pm.) He spoke out as two councillors in Oxford resigned from Labour today in protest at Keir Starmer defending the seige tactics used by Israel in Gaza. (See 3.32pm.) Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, has said the “collective punishment of the Palestinian people” is unacceptable and that Israel should lift its block on Gaza being able to access water, food, medicine and electricity.

Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has warned that the government will need to take “difficult decisions” in next month’s autumn statement after a sharp worsening of the public finances over the past six months.
The protester who threw glitter over Keir Starmer at the start of his Labour conference speech this week in Liverpool has said he is sorry for his actions.
Almost 40% of people do not have a view as to whether the government has or has not been too supportive of Israel, polling from YouGov suggests. Among those people who do have a view, slightly more (22%) think the government should be more critical than think it should be more supportive (16%).

Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, described the government as looking like “a terrible, tragic joke” during the pandemic and suggested that Boris Johnson’s wife, Carrie, was the person really in charge, according to private WhatsApp messages revealed at the Covid inquiry today.
The comments were made in a WhatsApp group comprising Case, Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s senior policy adviser, and Lee Cain, the director of communications, in an exchange from October 2020.
At the time Boris Johnson was resisting pressure from government scientists, and some advisers and ministers, to order a second lockdown. Case, Cummings and Cain were all frustrated by his dithering – and by the influence of his wife.
As Ruby Lott-Lavinga reports for Open Democracy, at one point, when asked what they were talking about, Case said: “Whatever Carrie cares about”.
He later told his two colleagues:
I was always told that [Dominic Cummings] was the secret PM. How wrong they are. I look forward to telling select cttee tomorrow – ‘oh, fuck no, don’t worry about Dom, the real person in charge is Carrie’.
And, making a wider point, he told them:
This gov’t doesn’t have the credibility needed to be imposing stuff within only days of deciding not too [sic]. We look like a terrible, tragic joke. If we were going hard, that decision was needed weeks ago. I cannot cope with this.

Two Oxford city councillors have resigned their Labour party membership over the Keir Starmer’s stance on Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks last weekend. In a joint statement posted on X, Shaista Aziz and Amar Latif say they were “deeply disappointed and alarmed” to hear the Labour leader appear to condone Israel’s decision to place Gaza under seige, cutting off water and power supplies, in apparent breach of international law.

The councillors may be referring to answers Starmer gave in an LBC interview on Wednesday, although he has made a similar case in other interviews – saying Israel should abide by international law, but refusing to criticse a move widely seen as illegal.
Yesterday, Lubaba Khalid said she had resigned her post as the BAME offfcer on the executive committee for Young Labour, an official party organisation, over the same issue. She said:
As a Palestinian, with direct family in Gaza, I am absolutely appalled by the comments made to LBC by the leader of the Labour party and my local MP, Keir Starmer, who said that Israel “has the right” to withhold water and electricity. Collective punishment is a crime under international law.
Given recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I today announce my resignation from my role as Young Labour BAME officer. @YoungLabourUK @UKLabour pic.twitter.com/sd967fPE4a
The mother-in-law of Scotland’s first minister who is trapped in Gaza has asked where humanity is, as she describes conditions in the Palestinian enclave under Israeli bombardment. Kevin Rawlinson has the story here.
Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said he fears a “disproportionate” response by Israel to the attacks by Hamas could lead to “inexplicable” suffering in Gaza.
Government ministers have supported Israel almost unconditionally, downplaying international concerns about its call for 1.1m people to evacuate Gaza City and not urging “restraint”. Keir Starmer and his shadow ministers have adopted a similar stance.
But Khan said he was worried the Israeli response might be disproportionate. Speaking during a visit to Medical Aid For Palestinians (MAP), a charity based in Islington, he said:
I’ve spoken to Londoners who lost family members in Gaza, and Londoners who’ve lost family as a consequence of the Hamas terrorist attack last weekend, so we’re feeling the pain here.
But we are worried about the response of the Israeli government being disproportionate [and] leading to the sort of suffering which is inexplicable.
We’re talking about human suffering on a scale which this charity, who has worked in that area for decades, hasn’t seen.
He said he was particularly concerned about the threat to Palestinian children.
No child has joined Hamas to my knowledge. Those people who are in hospital aren’t members of Hamas.
Of course, Israel must go after Hamas but what’s happening in Gaza is suffering on a scale which this charity has never seen.
Khan said the British government should be calling for restraint. Referring to Israel telling civilians to evacuate Gaza City before a likely invasion, he said:
I’m hoping the Israeli government will reconsider, understanding the pressure internationally, when you hear what the United Nations are saying, what the World Health Organization are saying, and when you listen to those people on the ground.
We should use our good relationship with the Israeli government to remind them of the importance of responding proportionately, allowing food, water and medicine to reach the people of Gaza, and explain the unreasonableness of expecting over 1m people, a population the size of Birmingham, to leave their homes and go south. Speaking to people here, there’s no way for them to go south.
Keir Starmer has cleared the air with some of his party’s most high-profile mayors after a crunch meeting in London facilitated by his new chief of staff, Sue Gray, Kiran Stacey reports.
Rishi Sunak has announced that the UK will increase its deployment of troops to northern Europe next year, partly in response to the threat posed by Russia to critical infrastructure, such as pipelines.
He made the announcement in Sweden at the meeting of Joint Expeditionary Force leaders, where, according to No 10, the leaders discussed “how they can address Russia’s sabotaging behaviour in the region, both through stronger defence collaboration and increasing industrial cooperation”.
Only last week damage was detected to two pipelines linking Estonia and Finland, No 10 said.
In a news release about the deployment, Downing Street said:
More than 20,000 British troops will be deployed to [northern Europe] next year, which is vital for the protection of critical national infrastructure, as the exploitation of hybrid activities and strategic competition in the area accelerates.
It said the deployment would involve soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen and women, as well as “eight Royal Navy ships, 25 fast jets and an aviation taskforce of Apache, Chinook and Wildcat helicopters. They will take part in large-scale, multi-country exercises, as well as carrying out air policing and cold weather training.”
In a statement, Sunak said:
As the international order continues to be challenged by desperate dictators, rogue states, and terrorist organisations – like Hamas - we must stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our international friends and partners to defend our values, security and prosperity.
Northern Europe is vital to our national security, which is why it’s more important than ever that we work with our Joint Expeditionary Force neighbours to protect our backyard and deter damaging hybrid threats.
London’s Metropolitan police say they have recorded a sixfold increase in suspected antisemitic offences compared with this time last year.
From 30 September to 13 October this year, 75 antisemitic offences occurred, police say, while in the same period last year 12 were recorded.
Antisemitic incidents reported to police, which may include non-crimes, increased sevenfold year to year, from 14 in the same period last year, to 105.
London tends to be the centre for protest and demonstrations in the United Kingdom.
The Met deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said police had asked the attorney general, the government’s top law officer, and the Crown Prosecution Service, which authorises criminal prosecutions in England and Wales, for greater clarity about what may constitute an offence.
He said displays of Palestinian flags were not an automatic offence, with context being key. “A lot of it depends on the circumstances,” Taylor said.
Jewish groups point out that after the massacre in Israel last weekend, displaying a Palestinian flag in central London may be fine, but doing the same in Jewish area may be an act meant to offend, intimidate and show support for the murder of civilians in Israel.
Taylor reiterated that support for the massacre by Hamas, or for the group, would be an offence and that the group was banned under terrorism laws and so displaying its flag or chanting support for it would be a criminal offence.
Rallies and protests are planned this weekend in the British capital including one starting at midday in central London.
Taylor said there was “no specific intelligence” of threats to Jewish schools in London, some of which have decided to close.
Taylor said police were investigating claims that posters put up around Camden, north London, appealing for information about those still missing after last weekend’s massacre were torn down. Other incidents include verbal abuse and the alleged playing of German military music, which was meant to intimidate Jewish people.
While Rishi Sunak has been talking about the rise in antisemitic incidents in Britain in recent days (see 1.12pm), Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has also highlighted the rise in Islamophobic incidents. He posted these messages on X last night.
Since the weekend, both @TellMamaUK and @CST_UK have reported over 300% increases in the reporting of Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents.
Since the weekend, both @TellMamaUK and @CST_UK have reported over 300% increases in the reporting of Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents.
I will always stand with Jewish and Muslim Londoners against those who espouse hate and division in our city. Those found to be committing these acts will face the full force of the law.

In his pooled TV clip this morning Rishi Sunak also said there has been a “disgusting rise in antisemitic incidents” over the last few days. He said:
Yesterday I chaired a meeting of police chiefs in Downing Street, together with the Community Security Trust, to specifically make sure that everybody in our Jewish communities can feel safe.
There’s been a quite frankly disgusting rise in antisemitic incidents over the past few days. That’s not right.
We have provided extra funding to the Community Security Trust to make sure that Jewish institutions – whether that’s synagogue or schools – have all the protection they need and the police have all the support that they need to ensure that our streets are safe for people from all communities.
Because we will absolutely not tolerate people inciting hatred, or violence or racist activity. Intimidating or threatening behaviour will not be tolerated.
It will be met with the full force of the law.
Asked if waving Palestinian flags or saying “free Palestine” in public could constitute a crime, Sunak replied:
There’s very clear guidance for the police about the measures that they can take, but inciting violence, racial hatred, is illegal. People who are acting in an abusive or threatening manner, causing distress, are breaking the law.
The police have the power and the tools that they need to ensure they can stop that from happening and you will see that in full force in the coming days to make sure anyone who breaks the law meets the full force of that law.
Yesterday the Metropolitan police issued a letter making it clear that they did not equate showing support for the Palestinian people with showing support for Hamas, and that waving a Palestinian flag did not by itself constitute a criminal offence.
According to PA Media, at the meeting Sunak chaired yesterday ministers and senior police officers discussed concerns over policing a pro-Palestine protest planned for the weekend in central London. The Met police anticipate more than 10,000 people attending.

“The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.
“The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation,” he said.
Dujarric said the order by the Israeli military also applied to all UN staff and those sheltered in UN facilities, including schools, health centres and clinics.

It is shortly after 7am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here is where things stand:
The United Nations says it has been told by the Israeli military that some 1.1 million Palestinians in Gaza should relocate to the enclave’s south within the next 24 hours, a request it considers to be impossible “without devastating humanitarian consequences.” “The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.
“The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation,” the UN spokesperson said. Dujarric said the order by the Israeli military also applied to all UN staff and those sheltered in UN facilities, including schools, health centres and clinics.
The Israeli air force has dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza since Saturday, it said late on Thursday. “Dozens of fighter jets and helicopters attacked a series of terrorist targets of the Hamas terrorist organisation throughout the Gaza Strip. So far, the IAF has dropped about 6,000 bombs against Hamas targets,” the IAF said on X. The attacks have killed 1,500 Palestinians, a third of them children, according to the Palestinian health ministry. 6,600 have been wounded.
The UN called for $294m for ‘urgent needs’ in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. The United Nations has issued an emergency appeal for $294m to address “the most urgent needs” in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, where more than 400,000 Palestinians have fled their homes in recent days. The funds would be used to help more than 1.2 million people, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said, adding that recent fighting in the region had left aid groups without adequate resources.
Israel’s parliament approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s emergency unity government on Thursday, including a number of centrist opposition lawmakers, to display its determination to fight the war with Hamas in Gaza.
As Israel’s unity government was sworn in, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a speech in which he promised, referring to hostages taken by Hamas, “We will not slacken in the effort to bring them back home.” Referring to Hamas, he called for countries that “maintain their presence” to face sanctions. As he ended the speech, he said, “Difficult days await us”.
More than 1,300 people, including 222 soldiers, have been killed in Israel, according to the military. The majority of the dead were killed in a single day, when Hamas fighters broke through the border and attacked Israeli civilians. Scores of Israeli and foreign hostages were taken back to Gaza. Israel says it has so far identified 97 of them.
Israeli bombing has destroyed eleven mosques, damaged 90 schools, according to the UN. It has also destroyed 752 residential and non-residential buildings, comprising 2,835 housing units, the UN says, citing numbers from the Gaza Ministry of Public Works and Housing. Another nearly 1,800 housing units have been damaged beyond repair and rendered uninhabitable, it said. The UN agency also voiced alarm at the significant destruction of civilian infrastructure damaged in the shelling.
More than 423,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in the Gaza Strip, the United Nations said, following heavy Israeli bombardments in retaliation for Hamas’s attacks. As of late Thursday, the number of displaced in Gaza rose by 84,444 people to reach 423,378, the UN humanitarian agency OCHA said in a statement sent on Friday.
Hundreds of Australians are preparing to get on repatriation flights out of Israel, with two planes to depart Tel Aviv for London in the next 24 hours. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said 1600 people had registered in Israel or the West Bank, including 19 in Gaza, for repatriation in what was an “extraordinary logistical exercise”.
Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, warned that the “continuation of war crimes against Palestine and Gaza” could open a new front of war, and that Israel will be “responsible for the consequences”.
Back now to the IDF warning the UN that 1.1 million people should leave north Gaza in the next 24 hours.
Israel’s military did not immediately provide comment on the warning, which came as it amassed tanks near the Gaza border and pounded the enclave with air strikes.But appearing to confirm a warning took place, Israel’s ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan, told Reuters: “The UN’s response to Israel’s early warning to the residents of Gaza is shameful.”Erdan said the UN should focus on condemning Hamas and supporting Israel’s right to self-defence.
The UN response that he refereed to was a statement from UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, saying, “The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences,” and that, “The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation”.
Kirby also told CNN that the US speaking to the Israeli military hourly about the hostages taken by Hamas.
“I can tell you that we are in literally hourly contact with our Israeli counterparts about the hostage situation, we’ve offered expertise and counsel, of course, they know how to do hostage recovery very, very well,” he said.
“We’re mindful of the delicate nature of this hostage situation, because they’re most likely being held somewhere in Gaza. It’s a war zone, it’s a combat zone that greatly complicates efforts to find them and to and to work on their release.”
White House National Security Spokesperson John Kirby has told CNN that the US is “working very hard hour by hour” to make sure that there is a way for Palestinians to leave Gaza safely.
“Whether or not there’s a ground incursion — and I’ll let the Israelis speak to their operations — we want to make sure that there’s a way for people who live in Gaza who want to get out to do it, and to do it safely and quickly, so we’re working on this very, very hard hour by hour,” Kirby said.
“We believe that there should be an opportunity for civilians in Gaza to leave now, yesterday, I mean, immediately.”
The Israeli military says it is preparing for a possible ground operation in Gaza but that political leadership has not yet decided on one. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht told reporters Thursday that forces “are preparing for a ground maneuver if decided.”
However, the evacuation order, if true, appears to indicate that a ground offensive may be imminent.
The military has invested tremendous resources for such a scenario, the Associated Press reports, even building a training base in its southern desert meant to replicate Gaza’s urban landscape.
Forces operating inside Gaza might have a better chance of killing top Hamas leaders and rescuing hostages, but such an assault all but guarantees far higher casualties on both sides. And it would involve street-by-street battles with Hamas militants who’ve had years to prepare tunnels and traps, AP reports.
IDF Spokesperson Jonathan Conricus will deliver a situational update at 7:40am local time, just under an hour from now.

The New York Times reports, “Israeli military officers conveyed the information to the leaders of the UN Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Safety and Security in Gaza just before midnight local time on Friday, the UN statement said. The UN was told that the marker dividing the north from south was Wadi Gaza, the statement said.”
Meanwhile the President of Brazil, which holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council, has appealed to his Israeli counterpart for the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to enable people in the Gaza Strip to flee to Egypt, he said Thursday.
The comments by Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva add Brazil to the voices of European foreign ministers and the World Health Organization that have called for the establishment of a route to either allow people to flee the Palestinian enclave or let humanitarian aid flow in.
He did not appear to be speaking in response to the IDF order saying 1.1 million people should evacuate in the next 24 hours.
“I recently spoke on the phone with the President of Israel Isaac Herzog,” Lula said on X, formerly Twitter. “I conveyed my call for a humanitarian corridor so that people who want to leave the Gaza Strip through Egypt can be safe.”
A Hamas official has told Reuters that the relocation warning is “fake propaganda” and has urged Gazans “not to fall for it”, the news agency reports.
More now on that news, via Reuters:
Israel’s military informed the United Nations late on Thursday, New York time, that the 1.1 million Palestinians in Gaza should relocate to the enclave’s south within the next 24 hours, a UN spokesman said, in what Palestinians fear could be a precursor to a planned Israeli ground offensive.The Israeli military did not immediately provide comment on the warning, which came as Israel amassed tanks near the Gaza border and pounded the Palestinian enclave with air strikes following a deadly Hamas militant attack in Israel.“The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.“The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation,” he said.Dujarric said the order by the Israeli military also applied to all U.N. staff and those sheltered in UN facilities, including schools, health centres and clinics.Israel’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If you’re just joining us, Reuters is reporting that the United Nations says it has received an order from the Israeli Defence Forces saying that “the entire population of Gaza north of Wadi Gaza should relocate to southern Gaza within the next 24 hours.”
This amounts to 1.1 million people, according to the report.
The UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric has reportedly said in a statement, “The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences.”

Gaza residents told to move south as Israel prepares for expected ground assault,2023-10-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/13/israel-hamas-war-latest-gaza-residents-told-move-ground-assault,"UN says Israeli military has given 1.1m Gaza residents 24 hours to move amid warnings it could cause ‘devastating humanitarian consequences’
Israel’s military has delivered sweeping evacuation orders for almost half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people before an expected ground offensive aiming to eradicate the Hamas militant group after its unprecedented assault on Israel and the seizure of dozens of hostages.
In the blockaded enclave, the evacuation notice issued in the early hours of Friday sent panic through civilians and aid workers already struggling under intense Israeli airstrikes, and a blockade in which no food, fuel or medical supplies is being allowed in. The UN considers the tightened siege a war crime.
In the order, the Israeli military told the hundreds of thousands of civilians of Gaza City to flee further south into the Gaza Strip, a narrow coastal territory. Israel’s directive charged that Hamas militants were hiding in tunnels under the city.
“This evacuation is for your own safety,” the Israeli military said, in a warning it said was sent to civilians. An Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson admitted in a briefing on Friday morning that it would take time for Palestinians to follow its orders to evacuate, but did not confirm a UN report that it had set a 24-hour deadline.
Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN secretary general, told news outlets that UN officials working in Gaza were told by the IDF “that the entire population of Gaza north of Wadi Gaza should relocate to southern Gaza within the next 24 hours”, adding that this amounted to approximately 1.1 million people.
Dujarric said the same order applied to all UN staff and those sheltered in UN facilities – including schools, health centres and clinics. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) is sheltering more than 60% of the 423,000 people displaced in recent days in the Gaza Strip.
It was not immediately clear how many people were located north of Wadi Gaza.
“The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences,” Dujarric said. “The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.”
Meanwhile, in the divided city of Jerusalem, people were bracing for midday prayers at the flashpoint al-Aqsa mosque compound: Israel has barred men under 60 from entering the area, according to the Jordanian Waqf, that administers the complex’s Muslim holy sites, and rightwing Jewish groups have called on Israelis to bar Palestinians from access.
Thousands of worshippers were expected to try to attend Friday prayers at the site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, which is accessed through the Old City’s maze of narrow streets and alleyways. Clashes broke out in the Palestinian East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Wadi Joz shortly after midday, and in neighbouring Jordan, military forces stopped protesters approaching the West Bank and Israeli boundaries for planned protests.
Israel has defended its response to the Hamas massacres that killed more than 1,300 people on Saturday, with backing from Joe Biden. More than 1,500 Palestinians, a third of them children, have been killed in the retaliatory strikes, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The Israeli air force said on Thursday it had dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza since Saturday. Hamas claimed on Friday that 13 captives were killed in Israeli strikes over the last 24 hours.
Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said: “The UN’s response to Israel’s early warning to the residents of Gaza is shameful.” Erdan said the UN should focus on condemning Hamas and supporting Israel’s right to self-defence.
Salama Marouf, the head of the Hamas government media office, said the relocation warning was an attempt by Israel “to broadcast and pass on fake propaganda, aiming to sow confusion among citizens and harm our internal cohesion”.
The warning came after Iran’s foreign minister said the continuation of crimes against Palestinians would spark a response from “the rest of the axis”, as Israel continued bombing Gaza.
Hossein Amir-Abdollahian did not give further details, but the axis of resistance refers to an alliance among Iran, Palestinian militant groups, Syria, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Shia factions in Iraq and Yemen.
Amid concerns about a widening of the conflict, Hamas called on Palestinians to rise up on Friday in protest against Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, urging them to march to al-Aqsa mosque and clash with Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank.
Human Rights Watch on Thursday accused Israel of using white phosphorus munitions in operations in Gaza and Lebanon, saying the use of such weapons puts civilians at risk of serious and long-term injury.Asked for comment on the allegations, Israel’s military said it was “currently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorus in Gaza”. It did not provide comment on the rights watchdog’s allegations of their use in Lebanon.White phosphorus munitions can legally be used on battlefields to make smoke screens, generate illumination, mark targets or burn bunkers and buildings, but it is considered an incendiary weapon under Protocol III of the convention on the prohibition of use of certain conventional weapons. The protocol prohibits using incendiary weapons against military targets located among civilians, although Israel has not signed it and is not bound by it.
A ground offensive in Gaza is likely to bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting. Israel has mobilised an unprecedented 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near the strip, and evacuated tens of thousands of nearby residents.
Scores of Israeli and foreign hostages were taken back to Gaza; Israel said it had identified 97 so far. Israeli ministers has said there will be no humanitarian break to its siege of the Gaza Strip until all its hostages are freed, amid growing concern over dwindling water, food and fuel supplies.
UN experts have condemned the Israeli bombardment as “collective punishment”, which is a war crime.
Late on Thursday, Israel’s parliament approved Benjamin Netanyahu’s emergency unity government, including a number of centrist opposition lawmakers, with the prime minister warning of “difficult days ahead” but determined to achieve “complete victory”.
Lt Col Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesperson, told reporters that forces were preparing for a ground assault in Gaza but that the political leadership had not yet ordered one.
Israel’s bombing campaign has destroyed 752 residential and non-residential buildings, comprising 2,835 housing units, the UN says, citing numbers from the Gaza ministry of public works and housing. Another nearly 1,800 housing units have been damaged beyond repair and rendered uninhabitable, it said.
The US has pledged to send more arms to Israel before the expected ground assault, as Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, arrived in Tel Aviv to offer US backing to Israel “today, tomorrow, every day”.
Blinken is expected to meet the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Friday as well as visit key US allies in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates – some with influence over Hamas, an Islamist group backed by Iran.
Blinken is to be joined in Israel on Friday by the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin,, who also planned to meet Netanyahu. The US military is placing no conditions on its security assistance to Israel, Austin said earlier, adding Washington expected Israel’s military to “do the right things” in its war against Hamas.
The presidents of the European Commission and parliament will visit Israel on Friday to “express solidarity with the victims of the Hamas terrorist attacks, and meet with Israeli leadership”.

Blinken urges Israel to avoid civilian deaths and wants safe zones in Gaza,2023-10-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/13/blinken-urges-israel-to-avoid-civilian-deaths-and-set-up-safe-zones-in-gaza,"Top US diplomat tours Arab states in effort to avoid wider war over expected Israeli invasion of Gaza Strip
The US’s most senior diplomat has urged Israel to take every possible precaution to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza as he called for the establishment in the territory of safe zones where shelter, food, water and medical supplies can be provided.
“We have urged the Israelis to use every possible precaution to avoid harm to civilians,” the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. “We recognise many Palestinian families in Gaza are suffering through no fault of their own and that Palestinian civilians have lost their lives.”
Blinken was on a tour of six Arab nations on Friday to try to forestall a wider war sweeping across the Middle East. There are fears that a conflagration may erupt if Israel’s determination to crush Hamas leads to a slaughter in Gaza or an enforced exit of millions of Palestinians into Egypt.
Blinken has put pressure on the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to open the southern border crossing from Gaza into Egypt or to open a broader humanitarian corridor, after Israel ordered 1.1 million people in Gaza to leave their homes and head further south in the territory.
But speaking in Doha after meeting Qatar’s prime minister, Blinken said he was working with UN agencies, Israel and regional powers on a plan for safe zones in Gaza.
He repeatedly defended Israel’s right to protect itself and added: “What makes this so complicated is that Hamas uses human shields, puts civilians in places where they are used to protect Hamas officials or their equipment or infrastructure.”
He added: “Civilians should not be the target of military operations. They are not the target of Israeli operations. They are very deliberately the target of Hamas operations.”
Qatar’s prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, said he was working on de-escalation, humanitarian corridors and the freeing of hostages.
US officials said Blinken had discussed Israel’s mass evacuation plan when he met the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Jerusalem on Thursday. “One of the things that we did discuss with them was the need to protect civilian lives in Gaza, the need to establish some safe areas, where civilians could relocate to be safe from Israel’s legitimate security operations,” a US official told reporters.
Palestinians and Arab states fear that rightwing members of the Israeli unity government are planning a permanent expulsion – a repeat of what Palestinians call the Nakba of 1948 – and are not just seeking to clear areas to make it easier to destroy the Hamas leadership. Israel has not yet been clear about its plans for the future administration of Gaza other than that Hamas must play no part.
The first indications from the well-armed Iranian-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon – as well as Iran itself – was that they were not going to intervene militarily immediately.
The Hezbollah deputy chief, Naim Qassem, said on Friday that the group was “fully ready” to contribute to the fighting.
He told supporters: “We will contribute to the confrontation within our plan … When the time comes for any action, we will carry it out. The behind-the-scenes calls with us by great powers, Arab countries, envoys of the United Nations – directly and indirectly telling us not to interfere – will have no effect.”
Iran has always avoided direct military conflict with the west, preferring to operate through proxies, and although it has supported Hamas ideologically, the west has produced no evidence that Iran directed the bloody operation by Hamas.
The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, spoke to the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, for 45 minutes this week in a rare direct call, and although both men support the Palestinian cause, neither side will want an all-out war with Israel. The Saudis have been in talks with Israel about normalisation of relations. A full-scale regional conflagration would see oil prices rising above $150 a barrel, tipping the world into a global recession.
The US is caught in the dilemma of defending Israel’s right to defend itself, but urging Israel in private to do so in a way that does not create a backlash across the Middle East and in parts of the west.
On Thursday in Jerusalem, Blinken said: “Israel has the right, indeed the obligation to defend itself and to ensure that this never happens again.
“But how Israel does this matters,” he said. “We as democracies operate to a higher standard.”
In an endorsement of the Israeli plan, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Friday that the Pentagon was ready to deploy more military aid to Israel as its forces prepared for an expected invasion of Gaza.
Blinken spent a morning in the Jordanian capital, Amman, discussing the crisis with the country’s king, Abdullah II, a longtime US partner, and the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas. He urged Abbas to try to restrain reprisals by Palestinians in the West Bank, but Abbas’s authority is limited.
Blinken flew to Qatar on Friday and is due to travel to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, before heading in the coming days to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The Hamas political wing has a base in Doha, so Qatar has been seen as a chief intermediary with the west.
The UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, told BBC radio that the UK was not aware of Israel’s military plans, but accused Hamas of using Palestinians as human shields. He said: “The UK government supports both Israel’s right to defend itself and that Israel is providing advance warning of military action so people can move themselves out of the way. It’s absolutely right that happens.”
The UN security council is due to meet later on Friday, and there were calls from NGOs for UN peacekeepers to be sent to Gaza under the UN doctrine responsibility to protect (R2P), but the idea will be vetoed by the west.

Shelling on south Lebanon border kills one journalist and injures six,2023-10-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/13/shelling-on-south-lebanon-border-kills-one-journalist-and-injures-six,"Shell, reportedly Israeli, struck group of international journalists covering clashes at border
A group of international journalists covering clashes on the border in south Lebanon have been hit by shelling, with one killed and six injured. The Associated Press and Al Jazeera said the weapon was an Israeli shell.
Reuters said: “We are deeply saddened to learn that our videographer Issam Abdallah has been killed. Issam was part of a Reuters crew in southern Lebanon who was providing a live signal. Our thoughts are with their families at this terrible time.”
Al Jazeera said two of its employees, Elie Brakhya and the reporter Carmen Joukhadar, were among the wounded.
Images from the scene showed a charred car. The shelling occurred during an exchange of fire along the Lebanon-Israel border between Israeli troops and members of Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group.
The Lebanon-Israel border has been the scene of sporadic acts of violence since Saturday’s attack by Hamas on southern Israel.
Farther from the border, after three days of attacks and counterattacks between Hezbollah fighters and their Palestinian allies on one side and Israeli forces on the other, an eerie quietness settled over the hills of south Lebanon.
Roads that meandered between olive groves and stony hills were deserted, town squares had emptied of noisy crowds, shops were shuttered and fruit and vegetable stalls abandoned. In Maroun al-Ras, a village atop a hill less than a mile from the border that was the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in a July 2006 war between elite Hezbollah and Israeli commandos, all the houses had their curtains drawn and doors shut.
During that war, other towns and villages scattered along the hills of south Lebanon were pulverised by Israeli aerial bombardment and shelling. Houses crumbled into piles of rubble and roads were turned upside down. About 1,200 people were killed in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and nearly 200 Israelis died, mostly soldiers. In that war, there was also significant destruction in Beirut’s southern suburbs.
In a suburban hardware shop, its owner, who gave his name as Hamdan, was defiant: “We believe in the resistance and nothing will dissuade us or change or beliefs – not the destruction of our property nor the loss of our families. It’s a spiritual matter for us,” he said.
In 2006, he said, he had fled his family house in a small border village in response to warnings from Hezbollah fighters. Israeli jet fighters destroyed his entire street a few days later.
Since Hamas and Israel went to war last weekend, Hezbollah’s engagement in the conflict has been calculated and gradual, allowing Palestinian allies to fire rockets and infiltrate the border to attack Israeli military units. When Israel responded by shelling a Hezbollah post and killing three of its fighters, Hezbollah retaliated by firing and destroying an armoured vehicle, killing one soldier and severely injuring another.
These attacks and counterattacks seem to follow the rules of engagement established between the two sides since their last war in 2006: violent deterrence that is limited in scope and geography while maintaining a general, if tentative, calm along the rest of the border.
So far, that strategy had enabled Hezbollah and its allies to engage in a war of attrition of sorts, keeping the Israeli military in the northern sector occupied without allowing the conflict to spill into Lebanon, with its shattered economy and crumbling infrastructure.
All that could change if Hezbollah and its regional allies decide more active involvement is needed to ease the pressure on Hamas in Gaza.
Along the road towards the eastern edge of the southern border, the tall concrete border wall, topped with metal mesh and mounted with cameras, was painted with murals showing people marching on to Jerusalem. Nearby, a group of four blue-helmeted UN soldiers stood chatting, basking in a deceptive and precarious calm.

Violence hits East Jerusalem and West Bank as Israel orders Gaza evacuation,2023-10-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/13/violence-erupts-across-occupied-east-jerusalem-amid-israel-gaza-evacuation-order,"Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces clash in several areas before expected ground offensive
Violence between Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces has erupted in several areas of occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as the Israeli military ordered nearly half of Gaza’s population to evacuate before an expected ground offensive.
In the West Bank there were calls for marches across several big towns and cities, but in the chaos across the region, details on what under other circumstances would be described as major incidents were hard to follow. Sixteen Palestinians were shot and killed in the West Bank over the course of the day, the Palestinian health ministry said, and the violence continued into the evening.
A total of 46 Palestinians have now been killed in the West Bank in the last six days – higher than the highest ever monthly total since the UN began keeping records in 2005. The number of casualties in the entirety of October 2015, previously the worst month, was 47.
Khaled Mashal, the former leader of Hamas, called for a “global day of rage” in support of Palestinians, demanding that governments and people across the Middle East protest.
“Tribes of Jordan, sons of Jordan, brothers and sisters of Jordan … This is a moment of truth and the borders are close to you, you all know your responsibility,” he said. The Turkish news agency Anadolu reported that thousands gathered in the Jordanian capital, Amman, but did not spread further after a ban on protest near the border areas with the West Bank.
Violent exchanges between Palestinians and Israel Defence Forces (IDF), as well as Israeli settlers living in the West Bank, were reported near Hebron, Nablus and Ramallah by early Friday afternoon.
Jerusalem, often a flashpoint for violence on Fridays, the Muslim holy day, had expected an influx of worshippers for this week’s most important prayer session at the flashpoint al-Aqsa mosque compound after six days of punishing airstrikes on Gaza, a tiny Palestinian enclave home to 2.3 million people.
However, turnout was low after the Jordanian Waqf, which administers the complex’s Muslim holy sites, said that Israel had banned access to Palestinians under the age of 60, and the Beyadenu Temple Mount Movement, an extremist Jewish group, threatened to prevent Muslim worshippers from entering the area. Israeli media reported that more than 2,500 officers and volunteers were patrolling the Old City and its vicinity.
At the entrance to the al-Aqsa compound, Israeli security forces checked Muslim worshippers’ identification cards, preventing anyone under the age of 60 from entering. A small crowd formed as those hoping to pray continued to try to enter.
“I am going to pray at the mosque whatever happens. I am 54 but maybe I will pass as older … I will try. They can kill us but they can’t keep us away from here,” said Abu Jihad, a construction worker from Beit Hanina in East Jerusalem.
Clashes between Palestinians and Israeli border police were also reported inside the Old City’s Muslim quarter, and in Issawiya and Wadi Joz, Palestinian neighbourhoods to the north of the dense 1 sq km maze of narrow streets and alleyways.
In Gaza, more firepower than was used in the entirety of the five-year-long international campaign against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been dropped on the 12km by 41km area in the six days since Israel declared war, in the aftermath of massacres carried out by Hamas across dozens of civilian communities and army bases.
The evacuation notice issued in the early hours of Friday sent panic through civilians and aid workers already struggling under intense Israeli airstrikes and a blockade, under which no food, fuel or medical supplies is being allowed in. The UN considers the tightened siege a war crime.
In the order, the Israeli military told the estimated 1.1 million civilians in northern areas around Gaza City to flee farther south into the enclave, a narrow coastal territory. Israel’s directive charged that Hamas militants were hiding in tunnels under the city.
“This evacuation is for your own safety,” the Israeli military said, in a warning it said was sent to civilians, although some said they received no notification. An IDF spokesperson admitted in a briefing on Friday morning that it would take time for Palestinians to follow its orders to evacuate, but did not confirm a UN report that it had set a 24-hour deadline.
Israel has mobilised 360,000 reservists in what is expected to be the longest and bloodiest war in the region since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. The foes have fought four wars and dozens of smaller escalations in the last 16 years.
On Friday, a trickle of Jewish worshippers made their way to the Western Wall, at the exterior of the al-Aqsa mosque complex, and the holiest accessible site in Judaism.
“I come here to pray every single day, and many people didn’t come today. They didn’t come and it’s a problem,” said Rabbi Eliazer. “I came here today at 6am, down Jaffa Street and Mamilla neighbourhood. There was no one.”
A school headteacher, Dorit Rodan, who came to Jerusalem from the West Bank settlement of Efrat to mark a cousin’s barmitzvah celebration, said she and her family were determined to celebrate the day. They posed for pictures with a photographer near the Western Wall, smiling in silk dresses.
“We debated if they’d let us do it, and if we were capable of hosting,” she said, explaining that some of her family, including her relative undertaking the barmitzvah ceremony, had flown in from Los Angeles for the ceremony. “Not all of our family came, people are afraid.” But, she added: “There are shelters here you can go to, and you have to continue life.”
A ground offensive in Gaza is likely to bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting. Israel has mobilised an unprecedented 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near the strip, and evacuated tens of thousands of nearby residents.
More than 1,300 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attack on Saturday and subsequent fighting on the boundary between Israel and the strip. Israeli airstrikes in response have killed more than 1,800 people in Gaza, authorities said.

 Hamas and Israel at war: what we know on day eight,2023-10-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/hamas-and-israel-at-war-what-we-know-on-day-eight,"Thousands of Palestinians in Gaza begin fleeing their homes after Israel delivered evacuation orders; Benjamin Netanyahu vows to eradicate Hamas
Thousands of Palestinians began fleeing their homes and moving south after Israel’s military delivered sweeping evacuation orders for almost half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people earlier on Friday ahead of an expected ground offensive. The UN said it was told by the Israeli military that about 1.1 million Palestinians in northern Gaza should relocate to the enclave’s south within the next 24 hours. Hamas urged people to stay put and defy the Israeli military order to evacuate homes.
Israeli airstrikes on convoys fleeing Gaza City killed 70 people, mostly women and children, the press office of Hamas said. Hamas said the cars were struck in three places as they headed south from Gaza City on Friday.
Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “eradicate” Hamas and said Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza “is just the beginning”. Netanyahu, in televised remarks on Friday, said Israel was striking at its enemies “with unprecedented might”. “Our enemies have only started paying the price,” he said.
Israeli troops carried out local raids over the past day in the Gaza Strip, searching for hostages and collecting evidence to find people taken by Hamas, the Israel Defence Forces said on Friday.
US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has urged Israel to take every possible precaution to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza as he called for the establishment in the territory of safe zones where shelter, food, water and medical supplies can be provided. “We have urged the Israelis to use every possible precaution to avoid harm to civilians,” he said.
The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said the Israeli military’s evacuation order is “extremely dangerous – and in some cases, simply not possible”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said asking vulnerable patients to evacuate hospitals in Gaza amounted to a “death sentence”. Amnesty International said Israel’s evacuation order “cannot be considered an effective warning” and called for it to be rescinded immediately.
At least 1,900 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza from Israeli strikes, including 614 children and 370 women, according to Gaza’s health ministry on Friday. At least 16 Palestinians were shot and killed in the West Bank over the course of the day, the Palestinian health ministry said.
A journalist has been killed and six others injured after an Israeli shell landed in a gathering of international journalists covering clashes on the border in south Lebanon on Friday. Reuters confirmed that its videographer Issam Abdallah was killed. Meanwhile, the BBC said its journalists were assaulted and held at gunpoint after they were stopped by Israeli police in Tel Aviv.
The US president, Joe Biden, said he had spoken with the families of Americans held by Hamas in Gaza, and that they were “going through agony” not knowing the fate of their loved ones. He also said he was making a priority of urgently addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
The Israel Defence Forces have denied allegations by Human Rights Watch that they have used white phosphorus munitions in their military operations in Gaza and Lebanon. HRW said the use of such weapons put civilians at risk of serious and long-term injury. Palestinian groups have asked for the international criminal court to investigate.
Tens of thousands of protesters rallied across the Middle East and in parts of Asia, Europe and the United States on Friday in support of Palestinians and condemnation of Israel. Elsewhere, Jewish communities in the US, France and other countries held rallies in solidarity with Israel after the Hamas attack from Gaza.
British citizens trying to escape the war zone in Israel are having their repatriation flights repeatedly cancelled by the British government, while emergency flights arranged by US and Australian authorities are landing in the UK. Late on Friday it appeared the government had turned to using military transport to evacuate citizens.

In addition to pro-Palestine protests reported earlier, Jewish communities in the US, France and other countries also held rallies on Friday in solidarity with Israel after the Hamas attack, Reuters reports, while some governments have stepped up security at synagogues and Jewish schools.
In the US, demonstrators have showed solidarity with both sides in the conflict, and major cities from New York City to Los Angeles have reinforced their police presence in Jewish and Muslim neighbourhoods.
In Washington, a rally supporting Israel and the American Jewish community drew about 200 people at the city’s Freedom Plaza, in view of the Capitol complex, where police had erected protective fencing the night before. In New York, thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators took to the streets.
Germany and France had banned pro-Palestinian demonstrations and several western countries said they had stepped up security at synagogues and Jewish schools fearing that protests could lead to violence.
In the Netherlands, Jewish schools were closed for safety reasons, as were two Jewish schools in London.
Police in Britain’s capital said thousands of officers were carrying out extra patrols, visiting schools, synagogues and mosques. At least two Jewish schools closed due to security fears. The boost reflected a significant increase in hate crime, particularly antisemitism, a police statement said.
In Warsaw, the chief rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich, was scheduled to lead a multi-confessional prayer for peace. Members of France’s Jewish community were to gather at the largest synagogue in Paris for the Sabbath.
Tens of thousands of protesters have rallied across the Middle East and in parts of Asia, Europe and the US in support of Palestinians and condemnation of Israel as it intensified its strikes on Gaza in retaliation for Hamas attacks a week ago, according to reports by Reuters.
In Turkey, crowds gathered outside mosques chanting against Israel and saluting Hamas. In the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir, 46-year-old business owner Mikail Bakan said: “All the Muslim world needs to be one against Israel.”
In Baghdad on Friday, tens of thousands of Iraqis rallied in central Tahrir Square, waving Palestinian flags and burning the Israeli flag while chanting anti-US and anti-Israeli slogans.
State-organised rallies were held across Iran – whose government is Hamas’ main backer and one of Israel’s principal foes – in support of the militant group, state TV reported.
Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem told a protest in Lebanon, the group was “fully ready” to contribute to the fighting. The group has already clashed with Israel across the Lebanese border in the past week.
Thousands of Yemeni citizens carried large Palestinian flags and shouted slogans during a demonstration in support of Palestinians in the capital, Sana’a.
In Indonesia, Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, the suspected mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, joined dozens of people in a march against Israel in the Javanese city of Solo.
In the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, activists protested against Israel’s actions after Friday prayers at the main mosque. Members of Japan’s Muslim community demonstrated near the Israeli embassy in Tokyo, holding signs and chanting “Israel, terrorist” and “Free Palestine”.
In Sri Lanka, protesters held up signs saying, “Palestine you will never walk alone”. Protesters also took to the streets in Bulgaria, Yemen, Cape Town, India’s Kashmir region, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Egypt.
Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations called for a “humanitarian cease-fire” in the Gaza Strip and Israel on Friday, while blaming the US for the ongoing conflict, according to a report by AFP news agency.
The Russian draft resolution, presented to the Security Council and seen by AFP, calls for an “immediate” ceasefire and the secure release of all hostages, and “strongly condemns all violence and hostilities directed against civilians and all acts of terrorism.”
The document did not specifically name Hamas.
“We’re convinced that the Security Council must act to put an end to the bloodshed and restart peace negotiations with a view to establishing a Palestinian state as it was supposed to do so long ago,” Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said after the closed-door meeting of the Security Council on Friday.
Nebenzia said there were positive responses to the draft resolution among some member states.
He also blamed the US for bearing “responsibility for the looming war in the Middle East,” and criticized European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen for “turning a blind eye to the Israeli air force attacks on civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.”
The Security Council is regularly divided on Israeli-Palestinian issues. Members spoke cautiously of the resolution after the meeting.
“The draft resolution appeared just two minutes before we went into the council meeting,” said British Ambassador Barbara Woodward. “I think for something that is as important as this, we’ve already seen how much human life has been destroyed. We need time for consultation, serious consultation.”
Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun said that “there is an emerging consensus on the humanitarian concerns,” adding: “We are open to all efforts which will help cease the fire, help de-escalate the tension.”
Brazilian Foreign Affairs Minister Mauro Vieira, whose country chairs the rotating presidency of the Security Council, said that “Brazil will continue to work closely with all delegations aiming for a unified position by the Council on the situation.”
China’s Special Envoy on the Middle East on Friday met with representatives of the Arab League in China for an emergency session on the crisis in Israel and Gaza, according to a statement from China’s Foreign Ministry released on Saturday. China’s special envoy, Zhai Jun, told the meeting that China supports the 22-member strong Arab League in playing an important role on the “Palestinian issue” and will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people. “The international community should earnestly enhance its sense of urgency to return to the correct basis of the Two State Solution to realise the peaceful coexistence of the two states of Palestine and Israel,” Zhai said, according to the statement.
Here is some more detail about the strikes reported earlier. The Israeli military says it intercepted two unidentified targets above the northern city of Haifa.
“Following the initial report, another unidentified UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] crossed into northern Israel. Additionally, an IDF UAV was fired upon. In response, the IDF struck a Hezbollah terrorist target in southern Lebanon,” Israel Defense Forces said on social media.

A 25-year-old Thai man who is among 21 Thai citizens killed following Hamas’ attacks has been named as Pongsathorn Khunsri in local media.
A report in the Bangkok Post says that Pongsathorn had been in Israel for a year, and was working on a farm. He moved so that he could earn more money and hoped to build a new house for his mother. He sent money back home regularly to his mother, hoping she could have a better life.
About 30,000 Thais are living in Israel, including many who work in agricultural jobs that offer better salaries than those back home.
An official from the Thai Embassy in Tel Aviv called his mother, Surangkhana, on Wednesday to inform her of his death.
“I never imagined my son would die like this in a faraway land. Many Thais have worked there, but why did it happen to be my son who was captured and killed?” Surangkhana told the Bangkok Post.
She told the paper that she did not have much detail about what had happened to her son.
The Palestinian United Nations envoy appealed to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday to do more to stop a “crime against humanity” by Israel, which has warned nearly half of the population of the Gaza Strip to relocate as it plans an assault, according to a Reuters report. “He has to do more. Whatever was done is not sufficient. We need all of us to do more to stop this crime against humanity,” Palestinian U.N. envoy Riyad Mansour told reporters before a meeting of Arab Group ambassadors at the United Nations. Countries urged Israel on Friday to hold off attacking northern Gaza, where more than a million civilians largely defied Israel’s order to evacuate before it goes after Hamas militants who slaughtered Israeli civilians last weekend. Israel’s UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan said on Friday that Israel’s warning to residents in northern Gaza was “to temporarily move south ... to mitigate civilian harm.” He was speaking at an event Israel hosted at the UN with families of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas and taken to Gaza in the attack. Guterres briefed the 15-member UN Security Council behind closed doors on Friday. “The situation in Gaza has reached a dangerous new low,” he told reporters on his way to the briefing, adding that he was in constant contact with the leaders across the region to try and “prevent further dangerous escalation in the West Bank or elsewhere in the region, especially in southern Lebanon.” Guterres reminded the parties: “Even wars have rules ... Civilians must be protected and also never used as shields.”
Israel’s military said early on Saturday it had struck a Hezbollah target in southern Lebanon in response to the “infiltration of unidentified aerial objects into Israel” and fire on an Israeli drone. The military intercepted the objects and the fire on its drone, it said, according to a Reuters report.
Nearly 240 Australians have landed in London on the first Australian-government backed repatriation flight from Israel, the foreign minister has confirmed.
Penny Wong said on Saturday that the Qantas-operated flight from Tel Aviv landed earlier on Saturday carrying 238 people. Overall, about 825 Australians had departed Israel and the occupied territories, she said.
“My department continues to assist a number of Australians seeking to leave Gaza, numbering about 20,” Wong said.
A second repatriation flight is due to leave on Saturday from Tel Aviv to Dubai. The government announced on Friday it would arrange an extra two charter flights, taking the total number to four.
Tens of thousands of people in Gaza are believed to have fled their homes and moved south following Israel’s evacuation warning, according to estimates by the UN humanitarian office OCHA. Prior to the evacuation order, more than 400,000 Palestinians were already internally displaced, it said.
Israel’s military has told about 1.1 million people in northern Gaza to evacuate to the south ahead of an expected ground invasion. Hamas urged people to stay put and defy the Israeli military order to evacuate homes.

"Families, festivalgoers, soldiers and foreigners: victims of the Hamas assault on Israel",2023-10-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/families-festivalgoers-soldiers-and-foreigners-victims-of-the-hamas-assault-on-israel,"In the early morning of Saturday 7 October, Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, sending thousands of missiles and hundreds of gunmen across the border from the Gaza Strip. The assault – which targeted military bases and civilians in towns and villages, kibbutzim and at a music festival – killed more more than 1,300 people. Among the dead were Israeli civilians and soldiers, and many people from countries across the world. Below are some of their names and stories
Parents Tamar and Yonatan and their twin daughters Shachar and Arbel, 6, and son Omer, 4. The family – who lived at the Nir Oz kibbutz, near the southern Gaza Strip – fled to their safe room when the attacks began but were murdered by Hamas militants.
Former Israeli football player Lior Asulin was among those killed at the Supernova music festival, his former club Hapoel Tel Aviv said on Twitter. Asulin, who had just turned 43, had been celebrating his birthday at the festival.
Hapoel said its fans Yaron Shai, Idan Raz and Ofir Liebstein (pictured), who was head of the Sha’ar Hanegev regional council, had been killed in the Hamas assault and that its youth football coach Alon Shamli was one of those shot dead in Egypt when a police officer opened fire on Israeli tourists on Sunday.
Osher Vaknin, one of the Supernova festival’s organisers, was killed at the event. His twin brother, Michael, is still missing.
Oriya, 26, was also among those killed at the festival. Her mother, Hannie, described her daughter as a “beautiful, cheerful, amazing girl”.
The 69-year-old was killed in Kfar Aviv by a rocket while trying to open a public shelter for people without access to shelters in their homes, Haaretz reported. She had three children and six grandchildren.
Dvir Karp, 46, is reported to have died while trying to protect his children as the attackers stormed the Re’im kibbutz. His partner, Stav, is also believed to have been murdered in the attack.
Married couple Itay (right) and Hadar Berdichevsky, both 30, are believed to have placed their 10-month-old twins in a hidden shelter when they heard the militants at the door. The couple were killed but the babies survived the attack.
The commanding officer of the Nahal infantry brigade was killed by a Hamas militant while en route to the clashes on the Gaza border on Saturday. The 42-year-old soldier is one of the most senior Israel Defence Forces officers to have been killed in combat in recent memory.
US citizens Deborah and Shlomi Matias were shot dead by Hamas militants as they hid in their safe room, CNN reported. Deborah’s father, Ilan Troen, said his daughter was killed as she tried to shield her son from the bullets.
Another US citizen, Hayim Katsman, 32, was shot as he hid inside a closet in a shelter on the Holit kibbutz, near the Gaza border, with his friend Avital Alajem. She told CNN that militants began firing at the door. “I was saved because he was next to the door and they shot him.”
Danielle Waldman, a 24-year-old American, was killed during the Hamas attack on a music festival. Her father, Eyal, said: “Each and everyone that met her have loved her. She’s done nothing wrong and nothing bad to anyone.”
Two Israeli-American brothers, Igal Wachs, 53, and Amit Wachs, 48, were killed when Hamas gunmen stormed their village ,near the Gaza border, Igal’s ex-wife, Liat Oren-Wachs, told CNN.
Daniel Senior, a 34-year-old Israeli-American who had been working at the Nova music festival near the Gaza-Israel border, was killed, her father told CNN.
Rotem Neumann, a 25-year-old Portuguese-Israeli citizen and student in Tel Aviv, was killed as she tried to flee the Nova festival early on Saturday morning.
A 19-year-old Spanish-Israeli woman who was undertaking military service in Israel was killed near the Gaza border on Saturday. In a tribute, her family said: “It is with great sadness and love that we say goodbye to our beloved Maya. She will always be in our memory as a happy little girl who was full of love, as a teenager who longed to discover the world, and as a young woman who loved Spain and her parents.”
A 56-year-old Argentinian who lived on a co-operative in Ohad, southern Israel, was killed on Saturday morning. “We will always be together,” his son, Yhonatan , wrote on Facebook. “Rest in peace.”
Ronit Rudman Sultan, 55, who lived on the Holit kibbutz near the border with Gaza, was murdered along with her husband, Roland Sultan. “My dear brother and my sister-in-law were murdered,” Roland’s sister, Nathalie, wrote on Facebook. “The head cannot understand, the heart cries and the words won’t come out because of the pain.”
Buenos Aires-born Silvia Mirensky, 80, died when her home on the Ein HaShlosha kibbutz in southern Israel was set ablaze by Hamas early on Saturday.
Abi Korin, who was born in Argentina in 1967 and emigrated to Israel in the late 1980s, was killed on the Jolit kibbutz. “Abi was in charge of security there,” said his mother, Sara. “He died fighting – we don’t know how, but we’re sure it was while defending others in the community.”
Two Brazilians, Ranani Glazer and Bruna Valeanu, both 24, were killed at the music festival after it was attacked at dawn on Saturday. Glazer was from south Brazil but moved to Israel where he served in the IDF and dreamed of becoming a DJ. Valeanu was from Rio de Janeiro but reportedly moved to Israel last year to study at university.
A 22-year-old Irish-Israeli woman, Kim Damti, was also murdered at the festival. Damti had lived in Gedera, in central Israel, and spent summer holidays in Ireland, where her mother is from. “With great sorrow and gloomy grief, I announce the killing of our angel, our flower, Kim, my blood, who was murdered by the cursed terrorists,” her sister, Laura, said.
A nurse from the Philippines was caring for her elderly patient, Nira, on the Kfar Aza kibbutz, according to the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, Fleur Hassan-Nahoum. Despite having a chance to flee the Hamas attacks, Angelyn stayed by Nira’s side. Both were killed, Hassan-Nahoum said.
Although the Thai government has not confirmed the names of the Thais killed, several family members have spoken to the media about the loss of their loved ones. Somkuan Pansa-ard, a 39-year-old Thai man, went to work on a banana farm in Israel last November, hoping to earn a higher salary so that he could take care of his family. His parents told Reuters that co-workers informed them on Sunday that he had been shot by Hamas militants. “Losing my son … is the biggest loss in my life,” said his father, Khraboan Pansa-ard.
Dua Sae-yang, 35, a Thai from the Hmong hill tribe in Chiang Rai, had moved to Israel two years ago, and was employed as an agricultural worker. His wife, Arachaporn Sae-ja, told Thai media that she had last spoken to him on Saturday, and that he had told her there was fighting close to where he was staying. On Monday, his colleagues confirmed that he had been killed.
Somchai Sae-yang, 24, Dua’s cousin, also from Chiang Rai, had been working in Israel for more than a year. He spoke to his wife, Aree Sae-Song, on Sunday at around 2pm, telling her about the violence, and that his Nepali friends had been killed. She was contacted by other workers on Tuesday, she told Thai outlet Thairath. They said her husband had been killed by a bomb while hiding in the bedroom.
Thawatchai Sae-Tao, from Nan province in northern Thailand, was killed during an attack on Saturday, his wife, Sunita Kongpirinan, told Thai outlet MGR Online. The family had spoken to him that same day, as it was his child’s second birthday. He had promised to buy new toys when his salary was paid.

"Don’t avoid discussing Hamas-Israel conflict with children, say experts",2023-10-14,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/14/discussing-hamas-israel-conflict-with-children,"Ignoring tricky questions could drive young people on to the internet, where disinformation proliferates
As difficult as it might be, carers should not avoid discussing the Hamas-Israel conflict with children, experts have said. Doing so, they warn, could drive young people on to the internet where disturbing disinformation and images are easily found.
“Don’t avoid difficult questions,” said Emma Citron, a consultant clinical psychologist with extensive experience of working with children. “If those questions are in the heads of our young people, it’s our job to give them a balanced and reassuring – but also an honest – account.”
But while questions should not be ignored, answers need to be tailored to the individual child.
Children under the age of about seven should be largely protected from knowing what’s happening. But those between eight and 12 are likely to ask questions like, “How do we know we’re safe?”, said Citron, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.
“Don’t say, ‘These things can never happen here’,” she said. “Because they do: we’ve had the Manchester arena and London bombings. Instead be quietly reassuring: say they’re safe because their school has security systems and it’s the same at home.”
Older children might ask if they should stop going to festivals and concerts. “Carers could respond by saying that we’re not going to be terrorised by bad people: we’re still going to do what we feel is right but we are going to look around us and keep our eyes open,” she said.
Deleting or pausing apps including TikTok and Instagram is a given. But again, said Citron, the action should be tailored to the individual child. She said: “Don’t just remove the apps from teenagers’ phones – have the discussion in a more open-ended way: ask why they think you’re suggesting it, tell them what they might see if they look at it and the impact that will have on them.”
Before answering your children’s questions, however, Dr Dan O’Hare, an educational psychologist, said adults had to take care of themselves.
“It’s a powerful role model for children in terms of how to process emotions to say, ‘I’m actually really upset about what’s happening and I don’t know what I’m thinking about it yet or how I’m feeling. It sounds like you’ve got some questions. Let’s come back to this this evening after dinner’,” he said.
O’Hare advised active listening by repeating back what your child has said to you. “‘Wondering aloud’ is a good technique – as long as you keep it focused on feelings and not thoughts,” he said. “So, for example, say ‘I’m wondering if you’re feeling anxious because of those images you’ve seen’ rather than ‘I wonder if you’re thinking about the children who have been murdered?’”
O’Hare warned that children can convey anxiety in non-verbal ways. “They might be quieter than usual or more irritable,” he said. “Even if you don’t think they’re anxious, children can very quickly see the world is unsafe and unpredictable so check in with them in a generalised way every few days.”
When discussing what has happened, he added, try to keep to broad concepts and avoid polarising words and concepts, like good, bad and evil. “That might be incredibly hard, given the emotions involved but those framings don’t ultimately lead to compassion and peace,” said O’Hare.
Prof Vivian Hill, the director of University College London Institute of Education’s educational, child and adolescent psychology training programme, said discussing this conflict with children was particularly hard.
“The challenge this time is it’s hugely sensitive, with both political and religious factors in play.
“We’ve got communities who are going to be feeling much more anxious than others and children who have specific triggers,” she added. “Children need to be helped to regulate their emotions and guided to evaluating the situation.
“Maps and historical context are helpful because while you can’t tell them it’s not going to happen here, showing them how far away it is and how complicated the history is, could lead to them quietly coming to that conclusion themselves,” she said.

Palestinians flee northern Gaza before expected Israeli ground invasion,2023-10-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/13/palestinians-flee-northern-gaza-before-expected-israeli-ground-invasion,"Thousands pack into cars and trucks or leave on foot after Israel told them to go, as violence flares in East Jerusalem and West Bank
Thousands of people have been fleeing to the southern half of Gaza before an expected ground invasion of the blockaded strip as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict descends into its bloodiest period in decades.
The UN says it estimates “tens of thousands” of people have fled their homes and moved south, adding that more than 400,000 Palestinians in Gaza were already internally displaced before Israel’s military issued an order to evacuate.
Hamas said 70 people had been killed when warplanes struck cars fleeing south on Friday, while Israel’s military said that its troops backed by tanks had conducted the first raids inside Gaza since the crisis began. Israeli media reported that a number of bodies of missing Israelis were retrieved in Friday’s raids.
Amid growing fears of escalating violence on several fronts after last weekend’s massacre of Israeli civilians by the militant group Hamas, almost half of Gaza’s 2.3 million trapped civilians faced the decision of whether to leave home, possibly never to return, after the Israeli army issued mass evacuation orders in the early hours of Friday.
Messages from Hamas broadcast by mosques around the strip called on residents to stay put on Friday after the order from Israel for the population to move south of the Gaza River, just south of Gaza City. Hamas called it “Israeli propaganda” and urged residents to “hold on to your homes and land”.
Joe Biden said it was a priority to “urgently address the humanitarian crisis” in Gaza. “We can’t lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and Hamas’s appalling attacks, and they’re suffering as a result as well,” he said.
The UN warned that the order to flee en masse would be calamitous, and urged Israel to reverse its order. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said the situation in Gaza had reached “a dangerous new low” and called for immediate humanitarian access. “Even wars have rules,” he said.
But Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the bombardment of Gaza was “just the beginning” of his country’s response. “Our enemies have only just begun to pay the price,” he said late on Friday.
For most of the day there were no signs of mass movement. But as the afternoon wore on, it appeared many people had decided that if they were going to move, it had to be before nightfall. The strip, where Israel has cut off electricity, would be plunged into a sixth night of total darkness amid continued airstrikes and shelling.
By about 3pm, thousands of people from the northern town of Beit Hanoun and the sprawling Gaza City had begun making their way south by any means possible. Some packed into cars and trucks, but with fuel supplies low because of the tightening of Israel’s siege on the Mediterranean enclave, many were walking distances of more than 12 miles (20km).
Israel’s order to get out came six days after an audacious attack by Hamas gunmen early on Saturday, on a Jewish holiday. At least 1,200 militants burst through dozens of points on the heavily militarised boundary around the Gaza Strip before fanning out to rampage through 22 Israeli towns and kibbutzim and 10 army bases.
The Rafah crossing into Egypt is still closed to fleeing civilians in Gaza. And for those who are severely ill or have been injured by airstrikes that have pounded the 26-mile by 7-mile strip for the last six days, the World Health Organization has said the ultimatum is as good as “a death sentence”. Aid agencies have described the evacuation order under such circumstances, and so quickly, as “logistically impossible”.
For many Palestinians, the week’s events are comparable to the Nakba, the Arabic term for the forcible expulsion of about 750,000 Palestinians from what was previously British mandate-controlled Palestine during the creation of Israel in 1948.
Yusuf Abu Rish, the head of Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, said: “It’s really a new Nakba and it’s even worse than the first one. No one can imagine what is going on the ground, it’s horrible. Even if there is a decision to evacuate, it’s not applicable at all … they [patients] will die.”
In the besieged territory, the evacuation notice issued in the early hours of Friday sent panic through the civilian population and civil defence teams, who were already struggling under intense Israeli airstrikes that have killed 1,900 people so far, levelling entire neighbourhoods. The Israeli directive charged that Hamas militants were hiding in tunnels under Gaza City.
Israel is not allowing food, fuel or medical supplies into the strip in a tightening of its blockade, a move that the UN considers a war crime.
An Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson admitted in a briefing on Friday morning that it would take time for Palestinians to follow the orders to evacuate. In response to questions from the Guardian, the army’s media desk refused to clarify what time the order was sent, and whether it included a 24-hour deadline, as the UN reported.
Saturday morning marked one week since more than 1,300 people were killed on what has been described as Israel’s 9/11 – more Israeli deaths than in the entirety of the five-year intifada, or Palestinian uprising, of the 2000s.
As reporters have gained access to affected towns and kibbutzim this week, the scale of the carnage has become clearer. IDF officials said they entered homes strewn with bodies, finding women who had been raped and killed, and children who had been shot and burned.
In response, Israel has already mounted the heaviest airstrikes on Gaza ever, mobilised an unparalleled 360,000 reservists, and amassed convoys of tanks near the border before what is almost certain to be a major ground offensive lasting months.
Scores of Israeli and foreign hostages were taken back to Gaza after Saturday’s attack; the IDF confirmed on Saturday that more than 120 people were being held by Hamas. The militant group claimed on Friday that 13 captives had been killed in Israeli strikes over the last 24 hours.
Human Rights Watch accused Israel on Thursday of using white phosphorus munitions in operations in Gaza and Lebanon, allegations the army has denied.
The expected incursion would be a pivotal moment in Israel’s war with Hamas – the fifth during the 16 years since the group seized control of Gaza, leading Israel and Egypt to impose a blockade.
It could also inflame fighting elsewhere: fierce clashes between Palestinians and Israeli settlers and army personnel broke out around occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank on Friday, killing at least 16, while to the north, a Reuters journalist was killed and six others from AFP, Reuters and Al Jazeera were wounded when they were caught in cross-border shelling across the boundary with Lebanon.
Israeli forces said early on Saturday that they had “struck a Hezbollah terror target in southern Lebanon” in response to a drone crossing the Blue Line between the countries.
Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group, has conveyed via mediators that it will be drawn into the fray if Israel launches a ground assault in Gaza.
On Friday, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said: “If these organised war crimes that are committed by the Zionist entity don’t stop immediately, then we can imagine any possibility”.
There is still no safe place for Gaza’s civilians to go. Cairo, a frequent mediator between Israel and the Palestinians, has discussed plans with the US to provide humanitarian aid but has rejected moves to set up safe corridors for refugees.
Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president in control of parts of the West Bank, told the visiting US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in emergency talks in the Jordanian capital, Amman, that he “rejects the forced displacement” of Palestinians in Gaza. Across the world, rallies and protests in support of the Palestinian people were held on Friday: tens of thousands of people gathered in Tahrir Square in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, waving Palestinian flags and burning the Israeli flag while chanting anti-US and anti-Israeli slogans.
Jewish communities also held rallies in solidarity with Israel.

‘They had no chance’: UK relatives of missing Israelis pray for their release,2023-10-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/they-had-no-chance-uk-relatives-of-missing-israelis-pray-for-their-release,"London-based Noam Sagi and Sharone Lifschitz hope against hope for safety of their parents, missing after kibbutz massacre
As Noam Sagi watched footage of journalists reporting from the Nir Oz kibbutz near the border with Gaza last Saturday, his heart sank when he saw his 75-year-old mother’s burnt-out car in the background.
His family had not heard from Ada since she called in distress earlier that morning to say Hamas gunmen had stormed the kibbutz and she was sheltering in a safe room.
“I saw them reporting from my mum’s front lawn and then I realised what’s going on there, and this is when my heart really sank. I was hoping for good news but I was really, really worried,” said Sagi, who grew up on the kibbutz and moved to London 22 years ago.
“I saw a man speaking in Arabic standing in front of her house reporting about looting and kidnapping, and then I hear gunshots. And there is another video that shows burning, so all the stuff is happening live in front of my eyes.”
Sagi, 53, has not had any official information about his mother, a retired headteacher, but he believes she is one of 150 people taken hostage by Hamas.
“It was not until 4pm on Saturday that the army managed to get hold of the situation, and when they got into her house they found bloodstains but she wasn’t there. And we haven’t heard since,” the psychotherapist said. “She’s not on the dead list, she’s not on the injured list, and she is not on the rescue list. That’s all we know.”
His anguish is shared by Sharone Lifschitz, 52, who said her peace-activist parents, 85 and 83, whom she did not want to name, were kidnapped from the kibbutz on Saturday.
The London-based artist and academic, who grew up with Sagi, told how her father spoke to her uncle shortly before the onslaught to say they could hear gunshots. Her mother was asleep and connected to an oxygen device while her father, who had overcome throat cancer, waited beside her. The couple have been missing since.
Lifschitz said footage from the attack showed a “horrendously well-executed invasion” and that the kibbutz’s 300 residents “had no chance”.
Sagi added: “They turned the gas pipes into the houses and gassed them. And after they either snatched them or killed them, they just threw a match inside and put it all on fire.
“They slashed them. They slaughtered them. They spread the bodies all around so no one will be able to recognise them. They captured elderly people and young kids from nine months old to 93 years old.”
The pair attended a press conference in London on Thursday to appeal to the international community to work towards the hostages’ release.

“I feel that I’m injured but I don’t feel the injury yet,” Lifschitz said. “Maybe at one point I will feel it. At the same time, I feel really strong. The worst has happened in so many ways that I have to rise to the occasion.”
She remains hopeful that a positive outcome can be reached, seven days after the hostages’ capture. “I believe that we can act in a way that can bring about their release. I’m certainly trying my tiny little bit to raise awareness,” she said.
Sagi shares Lifschitz’s hopes, saying his mother’s “main goal in life was to develop communication as a bridge for a better future”. Born in Tel Aviv in 1948 to Holocaust survivors from Poland, Ada was an Arabic teacher who campaigned for peace before retiring two years ago.
“Maybe I’m a fantasist, but my hope is that they realise that they actually kidnapped 80 people from this community who are all peace activists,” he said. “They’re marginalised in Israel for their political stance. They are the people who always believe that communication and human relationships can make a difference. I hope that they have a chance to show it now. That’s something that no politician can do, but this group of people can. Everything in their fibre is about peace, it’s about love, it’s about kindness.”
He believes the hostages from the kibbutz can make a difference “in a miraculous kind of way”. “This is my hope. Of course my fear is that kibbutz Nir Oz will become a cemetery and that community will be wiped out nearly completely,” he said.

Israeli ground offensive in Gaza faces physical and political risks,2023-10-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/israeli-ground-offensive-in-gaza-faces-physical-and-political-risks-hamas,"Military has might on its side but Hamas is prepared and the humanitarian fallout could prove costly
Israel is poised to launch a ground offensive into the northern half of Gaza, an attack that, for all the country’s military superiority, is fraught with uncertainty and whose potential humanitarian consequences are grim.
The military called up 300,000 reservists on Monday to add to its 170,000-strong standing army and has been massing them near the Gaza border. Hamas, it is estimated, can count on 30,000 fighters, perhaps a tenth of the likely invasion force, and it has neither the tanks nor the air power available to the attackers.
Such an overwhelming ratio should give the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) a high chance of capturing the area of the Gaza Strip, which includes its principal urban centre, Gaza City, from which its leadership ordered 1.1 million Palestinians to evacuate on Friday.
Hamas has long been ready for an Israeli incursion, digging a sophisticated network of tunnels across Gaza intended to allow its forces to survive aerial bombardment. Some tunnels previously discovered by Israel because they went under the border fence are as deep as 70 metres.
The heavily urbanised terrain – the Gaza Strip is one of the world’s most densely populated areas – will also favour the defenders as they try to fight back. Each remaining building will have to be fought over, and heavy mining could further impede the Israelis if Hamas copies the technique used by Russia to blunt Ukraine’s counteroffensive.
Israel, too, has been planning, and if the IDF gains control of the tunnel entrances it is more likely to mine them than try to enter them. But without full control of the subterranean network where Hamas command posts are likely to be based, any military control of northern Gaza will be insecure.
Israel’s demand that Palestinian civilians leave the north also indicates what is likely to be another part of the invaders’ strategy: a brutal attempt to clear the northern sector of Hamas fighters. Its intentions have almost certainly been presaged by what has already been a merciless aerial bombardment, killing more than 1,500 Palestinians, a third of them children.
Whole neighbourhoods, such as Rimal in Gaza City, have been razed. Іsrael’s air force said it had dropped 6,000 bombs on Hamas targets by Thursday, and it hit 750 more targets the following morning. A former UN war crimes investigator, Marc Galasco, noted that was nearly equivalent to the most bombs dropped in a year by Nato forces in Afghanistan: 7,423.
The near certain reality is that a ground invasion will be bloody, and it is possible international political support for Israel, which is high after Hamas’s brutal attack a week ago killed 1,300 Israeli civilians, will dip as more Palestinian civilians are killed or remain trapped without shelter, food or electricity.
There is also the question of what Israel’s medium-term strategy will be if it is able to seize control of the northern half of Gaza. It would be logical to look to the south; an incursion aimed at eliminating Hamas as a controlling force only makes sense if the occupation is total. This was the reasoning, on a larger scale, behind the 20-year, US-led occupation of Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 attacks.
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said on Wednesday that Israel’s goal is to “crush and eliminate” Hamas, but as the governing authority in Gaza it is deeply embedded in its society. HA Hellyer, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said that to take control Israel would have to “destroy all governing capacity in Gaza” and replace it with a military administration while almost certainly battling an ongoing insurgency.
Hasan Alhasan, a Middle East expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, went further, asking at an online seminar on Friday whether “there is any viable military strategy short of a total ethnic cleansing of Gaza that would lead to a permanent defeat of Hamas” and if “Israel is walking into a trap set by Hamas”.
Alhasan’s argument is that Hamas can “regenerate in a generation or two” because it can ultimately draw strength from Gaza’s 2.3 million-strong population, with new recruits nurtured on memories of a violent past. A similar point was made earlier this week by the former MI6 chief Sir Alex Younger: “You cannot kill all the terrorists without creating more terrorists.”

BBC building sprayed with red paint in ‘protest over Israel-Hamas coverage’,2023-10-14,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/14/bbc-building-red-paint-protest-israel-hamas-coverage,"Palestine Action says it was behind incident in London, accusing BBC of ‘manufacturing consent for Israel’s war crimes’
A pro-Palestinian protest group has claimed responsibility for throwing red paint over the BBC’s headquarters, accusing the broadcaster of having “blood on its hands” over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.
The organisation Palestine Action identified itself as being behind the incident, which took place early on Saturday morning at Broadcasting House. It alleged that the broadcaster was “manufacturing consent for Israel’s war crimes”.
Posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, the group wrote: “Palestine Action left a message overnight for the BBC: spreading the occupation’s lies and manufacturing consent for Israel’s war crimes means that you have Palestinian blood on your hands #ShutBBCDown.”
Palestine Action is an activist group that uses civil disobedience tactics, primarily targeting the UK factories of the Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems.
The Metropolitan police, however, said there was no suggestion the incident was linked to a protest group and that no arrests had been made.
Victoria Derbyshire, a BBC journalist and presenter, shared images and footage on Saturday showing the main entrance at Portland Place daubed with red paint. She wrote:
Just arrived at work. This is the front entrance to BBC this morning pic.twitter.com/BHkyAtKZWF
Broadcasting House was the starting point for a rally in solidarity with Palestinians taking place on Saturday. Protesters gathered outside the building before a march in central London and setting off at about 1pm. The main entrance was cordoned off, with officers nearby.
The BBC has faced criticism in recent days for maintaining its editorial stance not to describe Hamas militants as terrorists. The defence secretary, Grant Shapps, clashed with the presenter Mishal Husain over the corporation’s refusal on Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday.
A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “We are aware of criminal damage to a building in Portland Place, W1A. At this stage there is no suggestion this is linked to any protest group.”
The BBC radio presenter and DJ Edward Adoo tweeted on Saturday morning: “Just got to the BBC the main entrance is blocked someone sprayed red paint at the entrance.
“Regardless of your view on what’s going on this is not the way. Props to the security team on duty tonight.”

Tens of thousands of Palestinians flee northern Gaza after Israeli airstrikes,2023-10-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/israeli-airstrikes-hit-northern-gaza-as-palestinians-try-to-leave," Death toll from airstrikes reaches 2,200 Water, food and fuel supplies run low Foreign nationals not yet able to leave Israel and Hamas at war – live updates
Tens of thousands of Palestinians fled northern Gaza on Saturday, cramming into already crowded schools, homes and makeshift shelters in the south, as Israeli airstrikes pound the besieged strip before an expected ground invasion.
One strike hit a civilian evacuation convoy, killing a reported 70 people including women and children on Friday. They were travelling on a route Israel would declare safe less than an hour later, as it repeated calls for more than a million people to evacuate their homes in Gaza City.
Israel has vowed to obliterate the Hamas militant group after its fighters broke through the hi-tech fence surrounding the strip and went on a murderous rampage, killing 1,300 people, mainly Israeli civilians, and seizing dozens of hostages last weekend.
“The next stage is coming,” the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told troops in southern Israel late on Saturday, in a video posted by his office. “We’re all ready.”
About 2.3 million people are trapped in Gaza, facing a terrifying escalation of bloodshed and misery if fighting intensifies.
Israel has sealed all crossings into its territory and Egypt reinforced its border crossing, saying it would not allow refugees to enter.
Foreign citizens were briefly offered hope they might be allowed to leave the enclave before fighting starts under a deal agreed by Egypt, Israel and the United States. But the crossing to Egypt had not opened to anyone by the evening.
Food, fuel and water supplies were dwindling fast on Saturday after Israel cut all movement in and out of Gaza. Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for the UN Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), said that the enclave was running out of water because of a lack of fuel to run its treatment system.
“It has become a matter of life and death. It is a must – fuel needs to be delivered now into Gaza to make water available for 2 million people,” Lazzarini said.
The death toll from airstrikes, already at unprecedented levels, had reached more than 2,200. That included 724 children and 458 women, the Gaza health ministry said.
Medics are struggling to cope. “The hospital is overwhelmed with internally displaced families,” said Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a surgeon at Shifa hospital in Gaza City. “There are people sleeping on the floors everywhere, even inside the hospital. The crowding is going to lead to an infectious disease outbreak.”
“The doctors have brought their families into the hospital for safety. I slept on an operating room table last night. One of our plastic surgery trainees at Shifa was killed last night with 30 members of his direct family.”
Amid mounting fears of a communications blackout as Palestinians across Gaza found themselves increasingly without power or access to phone networks, he added: “Internet is impossible.”
The UN has appealed to Israel to rescind its evacuation order. The secretary general, António Guterres, said the mass movement of so many people across an active war zone “is extremely dangerous – and in some cases, simply not possible”.
Many residents cannot find transport, or cannot travel because they are old, sick, disabled, caring for someone with limited mobility or fear they have nowhere to go. Gaza was already one of the world’s most densely populated places, when its residents were spread across the full 365 sq km.
Israel’s faith in its army and intelligence services has been shaken by the attack, and although there is popular support for some form of military action against Hamas, there is also a great deal of anger against the government.
Idit Silman, a Likud politician and member of Netanyahu’s cabinet, was recently chased out of a hospital after healthcare workers and members of the public shouted: “You ruined this country … get out of here.”
On Saturday protesters gathered in central Tel Aviv to demonstrate against the government’s handling of the crisis and the lack of information about the dead and the dozens of missing, who are believed to be being held hostage in Gaza. They chanted “Bibi to jail”, using a nickname for Netanyahu.
“I came here because I want my daughter back and I am not going to move from here … until they bring her back,” said Shira Albag, 52, whose daughter Liri Albag was in an army base attacked by Hamas. She appeared in a hostage video in her pyjamas, Shira said.
Israel’s military has said it is preparing for a long campaign in Gaza, where Hamas has been preparing defences, including networks of tunnels, for years.
About 360,000 reservists have been mobilised, the largest number in its history, convoys of tanks have gathered near the border, and some troops made initial ground operations in Gaza on Friday.
Tank-backed forces had mounted raids to hit Palestinian rocket crews and gather information on the location of hostages, a military spokesperson said. The IDF also claimed to have killed the head of Hamas’ air operations, Murad Abu Murad.
But Israel has not detailed its aims for the operation, beyond the destruction of Hamas. Asked on Saturday what an Israeli military victory may look like, an IDF spokesperson, Lt Col Richard Hecht, said: “That is a big question. I don’t think I have the capability right now to answer that.”
Palestinians and some regional officials have said they fear Israel’s ultimate aim is not only to destroy Hamas, but to push Palestinian people out of Gaza. This would mirror the Nakba, the Arabic term for the forcible expulsion of about 750,000 Palestinians from what was previously British mandate-controlled Palestine during the creation of Israel in 1948.
King Abdullah of Jordan, which is next to the occupied West Bank, has warned “against any attempt to forcibly displace Palestinians from all Palestinian territories or cause their internal displacement”.
The head of the 22-member Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, urgently appealed to Guterres to condemn “this insane Israeli effort to transfer the population”.
Hamas has called Israel’s evacuation order propaganda, and mosques in Gaza City blared messages urging residents to stay, Reuters reported. “Hold on to your homes. Hold on to your land,” one broadcast, as tens of thousands headed south.
Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said the evacuation warning was “to temporarily move [people] south … to mitigate civilian harm”, adding that the UN should be “praising Israel for these precautionary actions”.
Some in Gaza City said they were refusing to leave, such as Mahmoud Shalabi, who is coordinating an emergency medical response with the group Medical Aid for Palestinians.
“I’m lucky that I have a generator and I can pump water from my water tanks,” he said, the sound of his children in the background as he spoke.
“This morning I went outside to buy bread for my family. All the bakeries are now closed, but even with the ones that are closed there are plenty of people waiting outside them, as though there’s a tiny sliver of hope that they’ll reopen. In addition, I went to try and go to the bank to get cash, and found it was partly destroyed by a bombardment that happened just in front of it.”
He added: “Last night was horrific. Bombardments were happening everywhere. The air was filled with gunpowder, we were breathing it heavily.”
Hostilities have been spreading, including to Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. Israeli forces said early on Saturday that they had “struck a Hezbollah terror target in southern Lebanon” in response to a drone crossing the border.
The Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah was killed on Friday while working in southern Lebanon, after missiles were fired from the direction of Israel, according to another Reuters videographer on the scene. Six other journalists were injured.
The Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, and a Hezbollah lawmaker blamed the incident on Israel. Israel’s UN envoy said it would investigate what had happened in the area after the journalist’s death. “We always try to mitigate and avoid civilian casualties,” Erdan said.
Fierce clashes between Palestinians and Israeli settlers and army personnel also broke out around occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank on Friday, killing at least 16 people.

Death is commonplace for Gaza’s lost generation,2023-10-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/gaza-lost-generation-conditioned-to-worship-death-israel,"Growing up in the Palestinian enclave leaves the young numbed to the violence of their daily lives
Two decades ago the mother of nine-year-old Abdul Rahman Jadallah described to me how she twice lost her child. Once to a worship of death and then to death itself.
Living in southern Gaza, the Palestinian boy had come to accept destruction and killing as normal, and to admire the men attacking Israel and what he saw as the heroic circumstances of their deaths.
The family called Rahman by his middle name and his mother, Haniya Abed Atallah, said that whenever Palestinians were killed he would race to the morgue to see the dead and tag along with funerals.
One day an Israeli soldier shot a shy eight-year-old who lived on Rahman’s street, Haneen Suliaman, as she walked back from the shops with her mother.
“Rahman went to the morgue and kissed Haneen,” Attalah said. “He came home and told us he had promised the dead girl he would die too. I made him apologise to his father.”
Rahman was in school a few weeks later when an Israeli bullet apparently fired randomly from a watchtower crashed into a classroom and hit a Palestinian girl in the head. Lessons were cancelled and Rahman defied his mother to join yet another funeral. As he hung a Palestinian flag on the fence enclosing Gaza, an Israeli bullet caught Rahman under his left eye and killed him instantly. The family wondered if Rahman knew that a soldier might target him because of the flag.
Palestinian boys in Gaza who were Rahman’s age in 2003 are now adults. Some will have become teachers or builders or have no work at all. Many will live perfectly peaceable lives.
But it is no surprise to Palestinian child psychologists and social workers watching children like Rahman at the time that others grew up to join Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Or that some would care so little for human life that they would delight in murdering more than 1,200 Israelis, including young children, and be willing to die doing it.
In response to those killings, Israel has launched a huge assault on Gaza as prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledges “to eradicate Hamas”. The Israeli military has warned more than a million Palestinians to get out of their homes ahead of an expected ground invasion. Yet experience shows that Israel’s assaults have proved less successful at crushing its enemies than creating another generation of new ones.
Through the early 2000s, I watched in Gaza as Israel launched one assault and assassination after another that the military said was going to cripple Hamas and put an end to its suicide bombing campaign during the second intifada. Missiles killed the armed Islamist group’s founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in 2004 and then his replacement, Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi, a few weeks later. But Hamas did not crumble.
Repeated military assaults on Gaza did little to weaken Hamas either. In 2004, tanks and bombs flattened a large part of Rafah on the southern tip of the enclave, just the latest of repeated invasions. Then came the Gaza Wars of 2008 and 2014 that left thousands of Palestinians dead.Yet a decade later Hamas was able to launch the most effective if terrible attack in its history, and have no problem recruiting men to carry it through.
Israel always claimed to minimise civilian deaths in its periodic attacks and yet somehow they made up most of the casualties with entire families wiped out. In between the military assaults, shooting was part of daily life and death. Gaza’s leading child psychiatrist, Dr Abdel Aziz Mousa Thabet, was despairing of the consequences of the violence on young minds. He estimated that two-thirds of children were traumatised by violence with profound consequences on Gaza’s future.
“They become fighters. I warned about this 15 years ago, that in 15 years these traumatised children will be more aggressive, they will want to fight, there will be more violence in the community,” he said. “It’s a cycle of aggression.” “So now we will have another generation of more aggressive behaviour. They will go to more extremes because they have no future… It’s a cycle of aggression. Children see their parents killed in front of them. What do you expect?” That was in 2009 and the cycle has not been broken.
Khitam abu Shawarib was the only social worker on the southern tip of Gaza during the repeated assaults on the enclave in the early 2000s. She watched the collapse of parental authority as children came to admire the men with guns. Abu Shawarib also told me that many children came to welcome the prospect of being “martyred”.
“The martyr is in paradise. He has glory here and in the afterlife where it is so much better than life in Rafah,” she said. “The children see many people killed, so they come to expect to be killed.”
High on Israel’s wanted list today is Mohammed Deif, the Hamas commander who planned the attack that unleashed Israel’s fury against Gaza. Israel has tried and failed to assassinate him but it did succeed in killing his wife and two young children.
Deif is a hero to many in Gaza. Young Palestinians, with little hope under the Israeli blockade of the enclave while they watch the occupation tighten its grip on the West Bank and Jewish settlers are given free rein to attack Palestinians there, find a perverse self-respect in supporting those they call the resistance.
The coming days are not likely to do anything to change that.

Tens of thousands of protesters across UK call for a free Palestine,2023-10-14,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/14/thousands-march-through-central-london-to-call-for-a-free-palestine,"Fifteen arrested at march in London, while demonstrations also take place in Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen
Tens of thousands of people have marched through cities across the UK calling for a free Palestine as tensions grew over an impending Israeli ground offensive in Gaza.
Protesters gathered in Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and London, carrying flags and flares and calling for world leaders to condemn the actions of the Israeli army.
Fifteen people were arrested at the protest in central London, after warnings from police that action would be taken against anyone showing support for Hamas or deviating from the agreed route.
One man, who allegedly launched a wooden stick at a passing Met van next to Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square, was chased by officers and arrested after reportedly jumping into a fountain at the landmark.
Nearby protesters then shoved police and threw objects, including bottles, at them, the PA agency reported.
The Metropolitan Police said on Saturday evening that there had been “small pockets of disorder and unacceptable criminality towards our officers in Trafalgar Square” and that eight of the arrests related to suspected assaults on emergency workers, as well as allegedly setting off fireworks in public places. There were also some suspected public order offences.
Nine officers were treated for minor injuries and a dispersal order was imposed on an area of central London that included Trafalgar Square, Green Park and St James’s Park to tackle “incidents of antisocial behaviour, crime and disorder”, the Met said. It added that the area around Trafalgar Square was “now clear”.
In Edinburgh, thousands staged an impromptu march to the Scottish parliament, chanting “Free, free Palestine!” and “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” as they made their way up The Mound and along Edinburgh’s famous Royal Mile.
Upon arrival, some activists “took the knee” and held a minute’s silence in solidarity with the Palestinian people.
Demonstrations were also held in Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow, where Bath Street had to be closed due to the number of people attending. Shaaista Bhutta and Muzaffar Yousaf, the parents of the Scottish first minister, Humza Yousaf, are understood to be among those who attended the rally.
In London, a pronounced police presence reflected sensitivities surrounding the march, and minutes before protesters set off, Scotland Yard announced that its counter-terrorism police were looking into more than 50 cases of “potential terrorist content online” in the period since Hamas launched its attack against Israel last Saturday.
The home secretary, Suella Braverman, had said earlier in the week that waving a Palestinian flag might be a criminal offence. Few at the march in London seemed to take such a threat seriously, with a sea of Palestinian flags visible as the crowd moved slowly down Regent Street towards Whitehall.
Waving hers proudly was Ruth Bennett, 72, and her daughter Tammy, who was attending her first demonstration at the age of 50.
“I’ve never been so offended in my entire life,” said Tammy. “Normally I’m pretty lazy politically but I’m so angry. How can a small child cowering in a tower block be considered a terrorist?
“Everybody seems to be turning a blind eye to what’s going on in Gaza. I had to be here.”
Born in Zimbabwe, Tammy said growing up in southern Africa had taught her much about the toxicity of apartheid.
Her mother said: “This is personal for me. In South Africa people were pushed into townships and rural areas against their will. In Palestine they actually want to wipe people from the face of the earth.”
Close by stood Ruaiya, a 16-year-old London student, energetically waving her flag and eager to send a message to the home secretary. “For me the flag is a symbol of peace, of human rights. A criminal offence? Genocide, ethnic cleansing are criminal offences.”
In a letter sent to chief constables in England and Wales earlier this week, Braverman also told senior officers to consider whether chants such as “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” should be understood as an expression of violence and if, in certain situations, they amounted to a racially aggravated section 5 public order offence.
Again, much of the crowd appeared willing to ignore such threats, with the chant frequently ringing around London’s West End.
The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed the rally, calling on political leaders to condemn the assault on Gaza.
“It is a day of solidarity and it is a day of hope,” said Corbyn, who now sits as the independent MP for Islington North. “There are many who say that nobody should be here today because they’ll be condoning terrible things. None of us are here to condone killing. None of us are here to condone occupation.

“If you believe in international law, if you believe in human rights, then you must condemn what is happening now in Gaza by the Israeli army.”
Elsewhere among the crowd, Shansul, 41, from east London said he had brought along his two children, aged nine and 13, to learn “the values of solidarity and the importance of standing up for the oppressed”.
He said: “It’s important for my kids to understand these values but also how lucky they are, that they can go home and play computer games in safety while kids in Gaza face being wiped out.”
Others had attended in the hope a strong turnout might precipitate a new political approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Tailor Shikha, 23, was not over confident. “If not, just please stop the siege of Gaza. Please.”
It was a sentiment repeated widely among those present in London. Selbi Durdiyeva, 34, a lawyer from Turkmenistan, said: “Civilians should never be targeted. The siege needs to finish. I don’t have an easy solution, but I do know that Palestine has the right to resist.”
In Edinburgh, where police on motorbikes redirected traffic to help facilitate the peaceful march, Iman, a Palestinian woman, said people in Gaza “need a right to freedom, and refugees need the right to return”.
She added: “We want justice, we want peace and we want freedom.
“I thank Scotland for not raising the Israeli flag. I thank Scotland for standing in solidarity, unconditional solidarity with my people. I thank Scotland for its strength to find a safe haven for refugees.
“We need corridors for people to receive medical aid, food and water.”
Another attender, a Labour party member who did not wish to give his name for fear of ramifications from the party, told PA: “I’m here because there are voices in the mainstream of UK politics that are on Palestine’s side – not the UK government and unfortunately not the opposition.
“I’m happy that other people are here too because I want to show that there are people in the UK who care.”
Six activists with Israel flags attended the demonstration as a counter-protest but they were outnumbered by pro-Palestine activists, PA reported.
In Manchester, hundreds of protesters waving “freedom for Palestine” banners marched through the city centre to the beating of drums and chants of “free, free Palestine”. Speeches were made at Platt Fields park before people marched through Rusholme to St Peter’s Square.
In Liverpool, several hundred people waved Palestinian flags as they made their way to the offices of BBC Radio Merseyside. Earlier, the pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action splattered the national headquarters of the BBC with red paint in protest over the broadcaster’s coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, which it said was “manufacturing consent for Israel’s war crimes”.
Speaking to the Echo at the protest, one protester said: “It’s just not fair and just. Everyone’s life should be the same. Everyone’s life should be equal.”
Another, attending with her family, said: “I would like to see that we’re able to come to a dialogue. We need to get to the point where we come to a real positive solution for the Palestinians.”

Aid flights land in Egypt amid efforts to open safe corridors into Gaza,2023-10-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/aid-flights-land-in-egypt-amid-efforts-to-open-safe-corridors-into-gaza,"No agreement by Saturday night on how to bring aid to trapped Palestinians before Israel’s expected ground assault
Aid flights have been arriving in Egypt’s Sinai peninsula with relief supplies for Gaza, amid diplomatic efforts to open humanitarian corridors into the besieged Palestinian enclave.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said during a tour of the region that the US was seeking agreement on establishing aid routes and safe zones. But by Saturday night, there was still no agreement on how to bring aid to the 2 million Palestinians under bombardment, as Israel laid the ground for an invasion of Gaza a week after a Hamas attack in which 1,300 Israelis and foreign nationals, mostly civilians, were murdered.
Blinken said he was also trying to ensure the conflict did not spread, on a day Iran’s foreign minister warned that Israel would suffer an earthquake if his country’s ally, the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, became involved.
“I know about the scenarios that Hezbollah has put in place,” Hossein Amirabdollahian said in Beirut. “Any step the resistance [Hezbollah] will take will cause a huge earthquake in the Zionist entity.”
Amirabdollahian added: “I want to warn the war criminals and those who support this entity before it’s too late to stop the crimes against civilians in Gaza, because it might be too late in few hours.”
On Saturday night the US president, Joe Biden, stressed continued support for Israel as well as the need for humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians in calls with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, the White House said.
In his first call with Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas since Hamas’ attack on Israel a week ago, Biden offered his full support for “urgently needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinian people, especially in Gaza”.
“President Biden detailed US efforts to coordinate with partners to prevent the conflict from widening, and the two leaders discussed the need to preserve stability in the West Bank and the broader region,” the White House said in a statement.
The White House also said Biden stressed unwavering US support for Israel in his call with Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he has spoken regularly since the attack. Biden also updated the Israeli leader on US military support and repeated his warning against any effort to broaden the conflict, it said.
Egypt controls the Rafah border crossing into Gaza, but under an agreement between Israel and Egypt after Hamas seized full control of Gaza in 2007, supplies entering from the south require Israeli approval. Since the Hamas attack last Saturday, Israel has cut off electricity and water to the territory.
Egypt has erected concrete barriers at Rafah, and its president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, this week restated his country’s long-held insistence that the Palestinians of Gaza “stay steadfast and remain on their land”.
The UN has appealed to Israel to rescind its order for more than 1 million Palestinians to leave their homes in northern Gaza and move into the southern part of the enclave before its expected ground assault. However, US officials told reporters on Saturday that Washington had not made the same demand.
They said the US had agreed with Egypt, Israel and Qatar, which retains close ties with Hamas, on a five-hour opening of the Rafah crossing on Saturday afternoon so that an estimated 500 Palestinians with American citizenship could leave. But the officials admitted it was unclear how many would be able to reach the crossing point, and whether Hamas would allow them to get there. They said Qatar was acting as an intermediary with the militant group in an effort to negotiate safe passage.
In Egypt, the state-owned Al-Qahera TV station, which is known to have strong links with Egyptian security agencies, quoted unnamed officials as saying the Egyptian government had made the delivery of aid to Gaza a condition for allowing the Palestinian-Americans to cross.
For the overwhelming majority of people in Gaza, such escape is not an option and their survival depends on humanitarian aid in the face of the expected Israeli onslaught.
The UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said its shelters in Gaza were no longer safe. “This is unprecedented,” Unrwa said in a statement. “Wars have rules. Civilians, hospitals, schools, clinics and United Nations premises cannot be a target.”
Blinken told reporters before a meeting with the Saudi foreign minister, Faisal al-Saud, in Riyadh, that the aim of his tour of the region was focused on protecting civilians from harm.
“As Israel pursues its legitimate right to defend its people and to try to ensure that this never happens again, it is vitally important that all of us look out for civilians,” the secretary of state said. “We’re working together to do exactly that, in particular working on establishing safe areas in Gaza, working on establishing corridors so that humanitarian assistance can reach people who need it.”
Blinken said that his regional diplomacy was also aimed at ensuring the conflict did not “spread to other places and other fronts”. Hezbollah has fired rockets across the northern border and warned that it would intervene if Israel launches a ground invasion into Gaza.
Before the Hamas attack, the US had been trying to seal an Israel-Saudi agreement to normalise relations, with incentives from Washington. That initiative, widely seen as a remote possibility even before the bloodshed of the past week, looked defunct on Saturday. Saudi officials were quoted as saying the initiative had been paused.
Amman announced on Saturday that Jordan’s King Abdullah was setting out on a tour of European capitals to build support to “end the war on Gaza”.
Two new aid flights arrived on Saturday at El Arish airport in Sinai, 45km from the Gaza border, and another three landed earlier in the week.
One of the flights, the World Health Organization (WHO) said, was carrying trauma medicines and health supplies.
“Every hour these supplies remain on the Egyptian side of the border, more girls and boys, women and men, especially those vulnerable or disabled, will die,” the WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a statement.
Meirav Eilon Shahar, Israel’s ambassador to the UN agencies in Geneva, replied to the WHO chief on social media, insisting that Israel was taking “every feasible precaution available to mitigate unintended civilian harm”, including the dropping of leaflets and sending messages on social media warning people to leave northern Gaza. She blamed Hamas for using civilians as human shields.
Human rights lawyers say the forcible transfer for such a large population and the heavy bombing of residential areas could constitute war crimes, and the Israeli government has yet to allow humanitarian supplies to enter Gaza.
Philippe Lazzarini, Unrwa’s commissioner general, said that the enclave was running out of water due to a lack of fuel to run its water system.
“It has become a matter of life and death. It is a must; fuel needs to be delivered now into Gaza to make water available for 2 million people,” Lazzarini said.
“Fuel is the only way for people to have safe drinking water. If not, people will start dying of severe dehydration, among them young children, the elderly and women. Water is now the last remaining lifeline. I appeal for the siege on humanitarian assistance to be lifted now.”

As the prospect of a ground assault on Gaza looms, defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh has taken a look at the risks, uncertainty and potential humanitarian consequences of such an operation.
“Hamas has long been ready for an Israeli incursion, digging a sophisticated network of tunnels across Gaza intended to allow its forces to survive aerial bombardment,” he writes. “Some tunnels previously discovered by Israel because they went under the border fence are as deep as 70 metres.
“The heavily urbanised terrain – the Gaza Strip is one of the world’s most densely populated areas – will also favour the defenders as they try to fight back. Each remaining building will have to be fought over, and heavy mining could further impede the Israelis if Hamas copies the technique used by Russia to blunt Ukraine’s counteroffensive.”
Sabbagh adds: “The near certain reality is that a ground invasion will be bloody, and it is possible international political support for Israel, which is high after Hamas’s brutal attack a week ago killed 1,300 Israeli civilians, will dip as more Palestinian civilians are killed or remain trapped without shelter, food or electricity.”
Chinese envoy Zhai Jun will visit the Middle East next week to push for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict and promote peace talks, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has reported.
Zhai “will visit the Middle East next week to coordinate with various parties for a ceasefire, to protect civilians, ease the situation and promote peace talks”, Agence France-Presse quoted CCTV as saying on Sunday in a video posted to its official social media account on Sunday.
Israel will start “significant” military operations in Gaza once it sees that civilians have left the area, CNN has quoted the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as saying.
The network reported that IDF spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said Israel had been very generous in giving “ample warning, more than 25 hours” for the more than 1 million Gazans in the northern part of the densely populated territory to move south.
Conricus said:
I cannot stress more than enough to say now is the time for Gazans to leave. Take your belongings, go south. Preserve your life, and do not fall into the trap that Hamas is setting up for you.
CNN also quoted Conricus as saying the area around the Gaza Strip was packed with “hundreds of thousands of Israeli reserve units” preparing for various missions.
The Palestinian health ministry said early on Sunday that 300 people, mostly children and women, had been killed and 800 others had been injured in Gaza over the past 24 hours.
Reuters quotes Gaza authorities as saying more than 2,200 people have been killed – a quarter of them children – and nearly 10,000 wounded in total as Israel hits back after last weekend’s unprecedented attack by Hamas militants.
Palestinian rescue workers have been desperately searching for survivors of nighttime air raids.
One million people have reportedly left their homes after the Israeli military told residents of the northern half of the Gaza Strip – which includes its biggest settlement, Gaza City – to move south immediately.
Israeli troops continued preparations on Sunday for their expected ground assault on the Hamas-controlled enclave.
The Israel Defence Forces says it is continuing to attack targets throughout the Gaza Strip and that “terrorists identified coming out of a tunnel shaft in Gaza territory were killed”.
Black-and-white footage of apparent explosions, filmed from above, accompanied the IDF’s post on X/Twitter.
It said:
The IDF continued throughout the day to vigorously attack military targets of the terrorist organization Hamas, with an emphasis on the neighborhoods of Jabaliya, Zeytun, al-Furkan and Beit Hanun.

Tens of thousands of people have rallied in London and other British cities at pro-Palestinian demonstrations, amid police warnings that anyone showing support for the militant group Hamas could face arrest.
Protesters marching through the heart of the UK capital on Saturday were shadowed by a heavy police presence of more than 1,000 officers, Agence France-Presse reports.
Similar rallies took place in Manchester in northern England, Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland, and other British cities.
In London, demonstrators massed neared BBC News’ headquarters before an afternoon rally near prime minister Rishi Sunak’s Downing Street residence.
Parts of the entrance to the building in central London’s Portland Place, where the rally started, were left splattered with red paint thrown by protesters from the Palestine Action group.
The broadcaster has been criticised by supporters of both Israel and the Palestinians.
A Reuters videographer killed in Israeli shelling of southern Lebanon has been laid to rest in his hometown in a funeral procession attended by hundreds of people, Associated Press reports.
Draped in a Lebanese flag, Issam Abdallah’s body was carried on a stretcher through the streets of the southern town of Khiam from his family’s home to the local cemetery.
Dozens of journalists and Lebanese legislators attended the funeral on Saturday.
Abdallah was killed on Friday evening near the village of Alma al-Shaab in south Lebanon when an Israeli shell landed on a gathering of international journalists covering exchange of fire along the border between Israeli troops and members of Lebanon’s militant group Hezbollah.
The Lebanese army said in a statement on Saturday that Israeli troops fired a shell the day before hitting a civilian car used by journalists, killing Abdallah and wounding others. The army said other areas in south Lebanon at the time were targeted by an Israeli helicopter gunship and artillery.
Lebanon’s foreign ministry asked Beirut’s mission to the UN to file a complaint against Israel over Friday’s shelling, calling it a “flagrant violation and a crime against freedom of opinion and press”.
The Israel Defence Forces said in a statement that it responded with tank and artillery fire after a missile was fired from Lebanon by Hezbollah. The incident was under review, the IDF said.
Israeli military spokesperson Lt Col Richard Hecht, speaking in Jerusalem earlier on Saturday, did not confirm that journalists had been hit by Israeli shells but called the incident “tragic”, adding: “We’re very sorry for his death.”
President Joe Biden has underlined US support for efforts to protect civilians amid the Israeli siege and bombardment of Gaza in a phone call with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The call was held on the same day Washington announced a second US carrier was being deployed to the eastern Mediterranean Sea near Israel.
“President Biden affirmed his support for all efforts to protect civilians,” Agence France-Presse reported the White House as saying in a statement about the call, which did not specifically mention Gaza.
Biden also spoke on Saturday with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmud Abbas for the first time since hostilities broke out, condemning “Hamas’ brutal attack on Israel”.
A White House statement about the talk between the two leaders said Biden told Abbas:
Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self-determination.
The US defence secretary has confirmed the US is sending a second aircraft carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, saying it is “to deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war following Hamas’s attack”.

Gaza civilians afraid to leave home after bombing of ‘safe routes’,2023-10-15,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/gaza-civilians-afraid-to-leave-home-after-bombing-of-safe-routes,"Analysis of aerial photos and social media posts confirms attack on road identified as safe by Israeli army
A convoy of vehicles carrying fleeing civilians in Gaza that was hit by a deadly airstrike was travelling on one of the two roads identified by the Israeli army as “safe routes” to the southern half of the strip, according to analysis.
The Friday afternoon bombing in Gaza City, which killed a reported 70 people, including children, occurred on Salah-al-Din Road, a main thoroughfare in the overcrowded territory, home to a trapped population of 2.3 million people.
The Forensic Architecture investigative unit at the Palestinian human rights organisation Al-Haq used aerial photos and social media posts to geolocate the site of the strike, sharing its findings with the Guardian. The BBC’s Verify unit came to the same conclusion.
The warring parties blamed each other for the attack. Hamas, the militant group in control of the Gaza Strip, said it had been carried out by Israel. In a briefing on Sunday, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) denied Israeli munitions had hit the convoy.
Video and pictures of the aftermath of the attack show 12 dead bodies, most of whom are women and children, the youngest about two years old, and several damaged vehicles.
The Palestinian health ministry said 70 people were killed on the road, which was filled with traffic as Palestinians tried to adhere to Israeli orders given early on Friday to evacuate the northern half of Gaza.
Shadows and the position of the sun suggest the attack on the civilian convoy occurred at about 5.30pm. At 6.03pm, in social media posts, the IDF identified the exact same road in an infographic as the safe route to follow the Israeli evacuation directive for about half of the strip’s population to travel south of the Gaza River, which is just south of Gaza City.
Conflicting timeframes for safe passage communicated by the IDF, and the bombing of Salah al-Din Road, a supposedly safe route, have led many people still in northern Gaza to conclude it is not safe to leave their homes.
The IDF declined to comment on the specifics of the incident on Friday. It said: “The IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm, including specific actions taken yesterday and today to urge civilians to relocate towards southern Gaza.”
Israel has also blamed Hamas, the militant group that controls the strip, for preventing the population from leaving: the militants have urged residents to “hold on to your homes and land”.
Hazem al-Enezi, the director of the Mubarrat Al Rehma orphanage in central Gaza City, said he could not move the children he looks after even if it were safe to do so. “We have 27 kids living here, nine of them are under 10. Normally we have 25 staff, but it is only me and one other care worker right now because of the situation,” he said when reached by phone.
“You have to understand, several of our children have physical disabilities and special needs, they are already scared and traumatised. There is no safe passage and no safe place for them anywhere in Gaza.”
Salah al-Din Road and the strip’s coastal highway have both since been identified by the IDF as safe routes for people to move to locations south of the river. The message was passed on in more social media posts, text messages sent to people in Gaza, and pamphlets dropped across the strip by air early on Saturday. The UN has warned that the order to flee en masse is impossible to carry out quickly.
It is not known, however, how many people have received the messages, as electricity has been cut and communication lines have been shaky since Israel began bombing the strip on Saturday in response to massacres committed by Hamas, the militant group in control of the territory, in southern Israel last weekend. The attacks killed 1,300 people. In Gaza, more than 2,200 people have been killed in the most intense airstrikes Israel has ever launched on the territory since Hamas seized control in 2007.
The unprecedented evacuation directive is almost certainly a prelude to a full-scale ground invasion by Israeli forces designed to root out Hamas. The airstrikes have already caused a humanitarian catastrophe, and more bloodshed on both sides is likely after the imminent ground invasion.
The Rafah crossing into Egypt was supposed to open for foreign and dual nationals to leave the strip on Saturday afternoon, but by sundown remained shut.

Israel appears to be on the verge of ethnic cleansing in Gaza | Ken Roth,2023-10-16,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/16/israel-gaza-mass-evacuation-ethnic-cleansing,"Netanyahu’s government might welcome a chance to shift a million or more Palestinians off the demographic balance sheet by clearing Gaza
The Israeli government’s mass evacuation order from northern Gaza is an ostensibly humanitarian act done in an utterly inhumane way. The order requires 1.1 million people to flee their homes in northern Gaza in advance of an imminent Israeli ground invasion – the next step in the Israeli response to the horrendous Hamas massacre and abduction of Israeli civilians on 7 October. Warring parties, if possible, are supposed to give “effective advance warning of attacks”. Yet the Israeli order will compound the suffering of the Palestinian civilians of Gaza. It may also begin an illegal process of ethnic cleansing.
The threat in northern Gaza is plenty real as Israeli bombers pulverize neighborhoods in attacks that appear designed less to pinpoint Hamas fighters than to collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza – the same population that has endured years of Hamas’s military dictatorship and had no say in Hamas’s decision to slaughter Israeli civilians. Yet evacuation has its risks, too. At least 70 people were reportedly killed while traveling along the prescribed road south.
And flee to what? Southern Gaza, already impoverished, is in no position to care for an influx of people that could effectively double its overcrowded population in a matter of days. Water is in especially short supply, because the Israeli government has cut off water to the territory (some may have resumed) and stopped the fuel needed to operate its three desalination plants. Food is not being let in. Electricity has been shut off.
Why target all of northern Gaza at once? If the point is to “destroy Hamas”, as the Israeli interior minister, Gila Gamliel, says, it hardly takes a brilliant strategist to figure out that, while parts of Hamas will fight Israeli forces in northern Gaza, other parts will deploy in the south. What happens if Israeli forces go after them? Another evacuation order? To where?
Given the humanitarian crisis that the Israeli government is knowingly generating in southern Gaza, the point may be to spark an exodus to Egypt – again, for ostensibly humanitarian purposes. The Egyptian government, a partner in maintaining Israel’s 16-year closure of Gaza, has no interest in a massive influx of refugees. Egypt is going through its own economic crisis, and in any event has long feared that large-scale movement from Gaza would include Hamas militants who would fuel the simmering insurgency in northern Sinai.
Yet if Palestinian residents of Gaza feel they must flee to Egypt to stay safe, they should be permitted to go. But they understandably worry that the Rafah crossing to Egypt will operate in only one direction – that their flight will replicate the nakba, or catastrophe, of 1948, in which 700,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became Israel, never to be allowed back. The vast majority of Gaza residents are descendants of those nakba refugees.
To see why the Israeli government might welcome a new round of ethnic cleansing requires understanding its policies of demographic engineering. Beyond wanting as a top priority to minimize the number of Palestinians (or “Arab Israelis”) within the 1967 borders of Israel – currently about 21% of the population – the government maintained a hierarchy among parts of occupied Palestinian territory depending on the degree of annexation and control that it sought. The next priority was to steer Palestinians away from East Jerusalem, which Israel already purports to have annexed, then from Area C of the West Bank, which contains all the Israeli settlements and many officials would like to annex. Then came Areas A and B of the West Bank, which enjoy limited Palestinian rule but are largely controlled by the Israeli government.
Last was always Gaza. The Israeli government has long controlled its borders – hence, the ongoing occupation – but had no interest in incorporating its territory so it could tolerate its population. But as Israel’s West Bank settlement expansion renders the prospect of a viable contiguous Palestinian state increasingly remote, there is growing recognition that the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River has become a “one-state reality”. And as pressure mounts to replace the apartheid in the occupied territory with a regime of equal rights, the Palestinian population of Gaza has grown in importance. With the proportion of Jews and Palestinians roughly equal across Israel and Palestine, the far-right extremists in Benjamin Netanyahu’s government might welcome a chance to shift a million or more Palestinians off the demographic balance sheet of that effective single state.
Gideon Sa’ar, the Israeli minister, said in an interview on Saturday with Israel’s Channel 12 News that Gaza “must be smaller at the end of the war ... Whoever starts a war against Israel must lose territory.” Yoav Gallant, defense minister, said: “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. Hamas won’t be there. We will eliminate everything.” They seem to be suggesting mass expulsion from at least a portion of the territory. But that collective punishment – that war crime – is a wholly inappropriate response to Hamas’s atrocities. It will be aggravated if it becomes force deportation to Egypt – the same crime that the International Criminal Court is already investigating Myanmar military officers for having committed by forcibly driving Rohingya to Bangladesh in 2017.
There is nothing utopian about insisting that the Israeli military abide by the requirements of international humanitarian law. These requirements are not a concoction of human rights groups. They are rules agreed to by all governments including Israel’s. They are not meant as a nice thing to do except when the going gets rough; they are requirements even in the most extreme circumstances, when a nation is at war, when its people are slaughtered. For the sake of Palestinian civilians, the Western governments that are embracing Israel’s unquestionable right to respond to Hamas’s vicious assault should also insist that Israel abide by the same rules that make Hamas’s targeting of civilians an unlawful way to fight against Israel’s occupation.
 This article was amended on 23 January 2024. In an earlier version, a reference to Hamas was omitted from the quote attributed to Yoav Gallant, owing to an incomplete translation used as a reference. These missing words have been added.

Israel-Hamas war: Biden says Gaza occupation would be ‘big mistake’ – as it happened,2023-10-16,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/15/israel-hamas-war-live-us-sends-second-aircraft-carrier-to-deter-hostile-actions-against-israel-ground-assault-on-gaza-looms,"This blog is now closed. Follow live updates from the Israel-Hamas war in our new blog here
An Israeli occupation of Gaza would be a big mistake, Biden said in his 60 Minutes interview. Asked whether he would support such a move, he said:
I think it’d be a big mistake. Look, what happened in Gaza, in my view, is Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don’t represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that ... It would be a mistake to ... for Israel to occupy ... Gaza again. We ... but going in but taking out the extremists the Hezbollah is up north but Hamas down south. Is a necessary requirement.
He said that he believed that Hamas must be eliminated entirely but added, “there needs to be a Palestinian authority. There needs to be a path to a Palestinian state.”
Asked whether he believed that Israel would pursue a two-state solution, which has been US policy for decades, after Hamas’ attack Biden said:
Not now. Not now. Not now, but – but I think Israel understands that a significant portion of Palestinian people do not share the views of Hamas and Hezbollah.
This blog is closing now, and our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict is moving here.
Here’s a summary of the latest developments:
The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will reopen for aid deliveries, US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said. Speaking after a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Blinken did not give any specifics about when the crossing would reopen. US media have reported that it will open at 9am for several hours.
UNRWA, the UN’s agency supporting Palestinian refugees, said on Sunday that Israel’s deadly strikes on Gaza have led to an “unprecedented human catastrophe” as Gaza’s death toll rises to 2,670 with 9,600 injured. Speaking to reporters, Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of UNRWA, said: “If we look at the issue of water, we all know water is life and Gaza is running out of water and Gaza is running out of life.”
Over 1,000 people were missing under the rubble of buildings in Gaza that have been targeted by deadly Israeli airstrikes, the Palestinian civil defence said on Sunday. In a statement, the civil defence team said many others were pulled alive out of the rubble, 24 hours after buildings were struck.
Gaza health officials have started to store bodies in ice-cream freezer trucks because moving them to hospitals is too risky and cemeteries are running out of space. Videos posted online showed bodies wrapped in white cloth stacked inside the empty trucks.
Israeli officials said they were restoring limited water supplies to southern Gaza, amid a wider water crisis, after a call between US President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
US and Israelis officials are discussing the possibility of a visit to Israel soon by Biden at the invitation of Netanyahu, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday. A potential visit by Biden would follow similar visits from other high-ranking US officials including secretary of state Antony Blinken and defense secretary Lloyd Austin. Blinken is due to return to Israel on Monday for a second round of talks with Netanyahu.
Biden, speaking to CBS, said he is “confident” Israel will act under the rules of war in its conflict with Palestine, and added deploying US troops is not necessary. In an interview with 60 Minutes, Biden said that while he believes Hamas must be eliminated entirely, there must be a path for a Palestinian state. And he cautioned that the threat of terrorism in the United States had increased due to unrest in the Middle East.
Reserves of fuel at all hospitals across the Gaza Strip are expected to last only about 24 more hours, the United Nations humanitarian office (OCHA) said on Monday. “The shutdown of backup generators would place the lives of thousands of patients at risk,” OCHA said on its website.
More than 600,000 Gazans have so far moved to the southern part of the Gaza strip near the Egyptian border city of al-Arish, before an expected Israeli ground offensive. International aid workers in Gaza described an unprecedented situation of “humanitarian collapse”.
The US has warned that the war between Israel and militant group Hamas could escalate, as American warships headed to the area amid growing clashes on the country’s northern border with Lebanon. “There is a risk of an escalation of this conflict, the opening of a second front in the north and, of course, Iran’s involvement,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced deployment of a second aircraft carrier group late on Saturday, calling it a sign of “our resolve to deter any state or non-state actor seeking to escalate this war.”
Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said the US would suffer “significant damages” if the war in Gaza spills over into a larger conflict, Al Jazeera reported on Sunday. “We have conveyed our message to the Zionist regime through its allies that if they do not cease their atrocities in Gaza, Iran cannot simply remain an observer,” Iranian state media cited Amir-Abdollahian as telling the network.
UN secretary-general António Guterres called on Hamas to release hostages without conditions and called on Israel to allow for rapid and unimpeded humanitarian aid access to Gaza. “Each one of these two objectives are valid in themselves. They should not become bargaining chips and they must be implemented because it’s the right thing to do,” Guterres said. The Middle East is on the brink of an “abyss”, he said.
The Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has said that he spoke by phone to the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Sunday regarding the situation in Gaza. Maduro told Abbas that Venezuela would send 30 tons of humanitarian aid to Gaza in the next few days, Reuters reports.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the actions and policies of Islamist group Hamas do not represent Palestinian people, according to official news agency Wafa, although it later removed direct references to Hamas from its report. In a phone call with Maduro, “the president affirmed his rejection of the killing of civilians on both sides and called for the release of civilians, prisoners and detainees on both sides,” added the news agency.
Amnesty International has verified six videos of an attack on Salah al-Din road – a supposedly “safe” route for Palestinians feeling Gaza – that killed at least 70 people. It went on to condemn Israel’s forced evacuations of Palestinians from Gaza, saying: “Israel’s order to ‘evacuate’ is NOT compliant w/ [international humanitarian law] & must be rescinded.”
France has warned Iran “against any escalation or extension of the conflict” between Israel and Hamas, the French presidential office announced on Sunday. During a phone call between the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, Macron warned against any conflict spillover into Lebanon.
Leaders from the EU’s 27 member states have issued a statement outlining their position on the situation in the Middle East. “The European Union condemns in the strongest possible terms Hamas and its brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks across Israel and deeply deplores the loss of lives,” the European Council said.
In a call with the Vatican, Israel’s foreign ministry said it expected the “Vatican to be more attentive to the suffering to Israelis.” The country’s foreign minister also called for a clear Vatican condemnation of deadly terrorism against Israelis and reiterated Israel’s right to defend itself.
Egyptian authorities have said the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will “most likely” open in the coming days, according to Michael Capponi, head of the Global Empowerment Mission aid agency.
Capponi said the agency was sending “large convoys” to the border early on Monday. “Once that pipeline is working we plan on sending daily convoys through,” he said, adding that it would be coordinating with UN humanitarian agencies.
He said the “main issue” holding up the reopening appeared to be that the “US wants to ensure proper checking of trucks occur so weapons are not filtered to Hamas”.
He added:
The events unfolding in the region have the potential to become one of the biggest humanitarian crisis in recent history. It is our duty and obligation to help all human beings who are caught in the crossroads of this war.
Five Canadians have been killed in the violence between Israel and Hamas, the Canadian government has confirmed, according to Canadian media.
Three Canadians are still missing, CTV News reported, citing Julie Sunday, Global Affairs Canada’s assistant deputy minister for consular security and emergency.
“It has always been a possibility that missing persons would be confirmed deceased ... It is an extremely tragic outcome,” Sunday said, announcing the fifth death. “Our thoughts are with the families in all of these cases.”
“We are very focused on addressing the cases of the three missing persons, who we continue to try to locate and bring back to safety in Canada.”
Palestinians in Gaza said Israel’s bombing campaign overnight was the heaviest since it launched its retaliatory attacks last week, Reuters reports.
Bombardment was especially heavy in Gaza City, with airstrikes hitting the areas around two of the city’s main hospitals, they said.
Authorities in Gaza said at least 2,670 people had so far been killed by Israel’s retaliatory strikes, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded. Another 1,000 people were missing and believed to be under rubble.
In case you missed it, my colleague Ruth Michaelson has written this explainer about the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt and why Egypt has closed it.
In essence, Cairo fears that any exodus of Palestinians to its Sinai peninsula could become permanent, while Palestinians worry that Israel may not allow them back to their homes in Gaza.
Egyptian president Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi alluded to concerns about the consequences of an exodus of Palestinians from Gaza last week, saying that allowing them to settle in the Sinai, even temporarily, would be tantamount to allowing Israel to control an emptied Gaza Strip.
Egypt is also in the throes of a major economic crisis making the prospect of accepting refugees a challenging one. Egypt’s last remaining independent news outlet, Mada Masr, reported that while Cairo had rejected any suggestion of a mass displacement from Gaza into the Sinai, it was still “coming under pressure from western countries who are also offering economic incentives in an effort to come to a deal”.
UK prime minister Rishi Sunak will address British MPs on Monday about the escalating crisis in Israel and Gaza.
Sunak is expected to use his Commons statement to set out how the UK is supporting Israel and aiding British nationals caught in the fighting, while also detailing ministers’ response to the humanitarian situation inside Gaza.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was welcomed to Downing Street on Sunday evening, as the ruler embarked on a diplomatic tour of Europe to rally international support to stop the war. Number 10 said that the prime minister would hold talks with other leaders and international partners in the days to come, as the conflict showed little sign of coming to a swift conclusion.
UK foreign secretary James Cleverly indicated on Sunday that about 10 British people are currently being held hostage by Hamas, telling Sky News that such a figure was “not an unreasonable estimate”.
The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza is to open at 9am (0600 GMT) on Monday, NBC News has reported, citing a Palestinian official.
Citing a security source, ABC News reported the crossing would open for a few hours on Monday, without providing details. The Guardian is not able to confirm either of these reports.
US secretary of state Antony Blinken earlier said the crossing would be reopened, without giving any specifics, after a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
Asked whether he could confirm that the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Israel would be open tomorrow, Conricus said:
I know that there have been such discussions … I cannot yet confirm that they have been fruitful.
He also blamed Hamas for previously refusing to open the gate. Israel bombed the crossing last week.
More than 6,000 rockets have been fired at Israel and Israeli civilians since the war started, Conricus has said, accusing the media of underreporting this aspect.
Conricus also denied that Israel was targeting civilians in Gaza. “We strike Hamas, we strike their infrastructure and we are hunting their commanders,” he said. “Categorically we are not trying to strike civilians.”
But he said that traditional methods such as “roof-knocking” to warn civilians to evacuate targeted buildings could not always be used “for obvious reasons”.
He also said Israel has not used and will not use thermobaric bombs “as far as I know”.
Asked whether he could confirm media reports that Hamas had executed some of its hostages, Conricus said:
That’s a very sensitive topic … No reports of hostages [being] executed have been confirmed.
As of now is we have is a special task force at the national level .. and we are looking for information and of course we are extremely committed to getting them [the hostages] back.
Conricus has accused Hamas of carrying out the attack on a civilian evacuation convoy in Gaza on Friday in which about 70 people died. He said:
We did not actively target any convoy of civilians ... we assess this attack was done by Hamas ...
When you apply logic and you think who would benefit from those horrible images ... who stands to gain from that? Only one organisation: Hamas.
We have seen there there is no limit to its depravity… this is an organisation of subhumans ...
I don’t think it’s beneath Hamas to kill civilians if they think it will help them in the international arena.
Asked what Israel is doing to support Palestinian civilians evacuate Conricus said,
Support wise since we are at war with Hamas and Hamas governs the Gaza Strip our support quote–unquote is we have opened up two evacuation routes to the south... we have communicated it to the Gazans that the routes are safe to use. That’s the main support. And we have called on Gazans to evacuate …
Hopeful they will listen to those warnings.
The Israel Defence Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus is giving an update. Asked about what type of weapons Israel is using, he said Israel was using “Nato standard” weapons in its bombardment of Gaza and that Israel is committed to international law.
“We are using standard Nato equivalent, Nato standard weapons, very similar to thse used by Nato forces around the world …
We are committed to international law ...
We try in general to use the lightest weapons, the most precise weapons that we have in order to strike specific targets.
An update from Reuters here, which writes that comments by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas criticising Hamas – which we reported on earlier – have been removed from a report by the Palestinian news agency Wafa on its website. Reuters says:
The comments, published by Wafa on its website, came during a phone call between Abbas and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The two discussed Israel’s bombardment of Gaza following Hamas’ deadly rampage through Israeli cities.
The original Wafa report on Abbas’ call included the line: “The president also stressed that Hamas’ policies and actions do not represent the Palestinian people, and the policies, programs and decisions of the (Palestine Liberation Organization) represent the Palestinian people as their sole legitimate representative.”
Several hours later, the phrase was adjusted to read: “The president also stressed that the policies, programs, and decisions of the PLO represent the Palestinian people as their sole legitimate representative, and not the policies of any other organization.”
It was not immediately clear why the reference to Hamas was removed. There was no immediate comment by Abbas’ office or by Wafa. Hamas had no immediate comment.
Abbas’ Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He has long been opposed to Hamas, which seized control of Gaza in 2007 and ousted Fatah party forces loyal to Abbas. Years of reconciliation talks between the rivals have failed to reach a breakthrough.
Palestinian civilians “should not suffer because of the depravity of Hamas”, US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said in an interview with Riyadh-based broadcaster al-Arabiya.
Blinken, who has been touring Arab states and is expected to return to Israel on Monday, said the US was focused on getting humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip, getting civilians out of harm’s way and on getting US citizens out.
However, asked whether a ceasefire could be held in order to allow aid in, he said that attacks by Hamas on Israel were continuing and that “no country can tolerate this”.
So Israel, as I said, has the right to defend itself; in fact, it has the obligation to defend itself. But as I’ve also said – and President Biden’s been very clear about this – the way that it does it matters, makes a difference. And that’s why it is very important that Israel do everything possible to ensure that civilians are not harmed.
He also rejected a proposition put forward by Israeli officials, that Gazans could be relocated to Egypt’s Sinai peninsula, the desert region to the south of Gaza. He said:
I’ve heard directly from Palestinian Authority President Abbas and from virtually every other leader that I’ve talked to in the region, that that idea is a nonstarter, and so we do not support it. We believe that people should be able to stay in Gaza, their home.

Hamas and Israel at war: what we know on day 10,2023-10-17,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/16/hamas-and-israel-at-war-what-we-know-on-day-ten,"Israel evacuates 28 communities near Lebanon; number of known hostages taken by Hamas rises to 199; Palestinian death toll now at least 2,750
Israel has activated a plan to evacuate residents within 2km (1.2 miles) of Lebanon, the military said on Monday. It follows exchanges of fire with Hezbollah in parallel to the conflict in southern Israel with Hamas. In a statement, the Israel Defence Forces and the ministry of defence said the plan had been approved by the defence secretary, Yoav Gallant, and included the evacuation of 28 communities. Residents will be moved to state-subsidised guesthouses.
The Israeli military said it had confirmed that Hamas was holding 199 hostages in Gaza. The hostages were seized on Saturday 7 October when Hamas fighters broke through the Israeli border fence in southern Israel and attacked a music festival and multiple other locations, killing more than 1,300 Israelis.
The Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said: “There is a top national priority effort for the issue of the abductees and we are focused on this effort as a national top priority. The IDF is working around the clock to return the abductees.” He added that the IDF had notified the families of all 199. Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem, has offered himself in exchange for child hostages.
Benjamin Netanyahu told the Knesset that the nation of Israel was united in its goal of victory, while conceding that there would be an investigation into the intelligence and security failures that had allowed Hamas to mount such a devastating attack. He called on the world to unite and fight Hamas.
Gaza’s health ministry said at least 2,750 Palestinians had been killed and 9,700 wounded in Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip since 7 October. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said Israel had killed 11 Palestinian journalists in its airstrikes on Gaza.
The UN relief and works agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) has said there are not enough body bags for the dead in Gaza. Its latest situational report noted that Gaza had been without electricity for five days, there was limited access to clean drinking water, and more than 1 million people had been displaced.
The Egyptian foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, said on Monday that the Israeli government had yet to take a stance that allowed the crossing between Egypt and Gaza to open. There was some movement of UN-flagged fuel trucks at the border on Monday morning, but despite speculation of a local ceasefire and a limited opening, the crossing has remained closed.
The UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, said on Monday he would be travelling to the Middle East on Tuesday to support negotiations on getting aid into the blockaded Gaza Strip. Griffiths said his office was in “deep discussions” with Israel, Egypt and other parties.
Lebanon’s Hezbollah said it targeted five Israeli positions in northern Israel. The IDF said it was returning fire over the “Blue Line” that has marked the boundary between Israel and Lebanon since 2000.
Half of the hotel rooms in Israel are being used to house families evacuated from communities near the Gaza Strip, the head of the Israel Hotel Association said on Monday.
Israel and Hamas have made claim and counter-claim about whether Israel has resupplied water to Gaza. Israel said water was being supplied near Khan Yunis in southern Gaza. The Hamas interior ministry spokesperson Eyad al-Bozom said it was not.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has arrived back in Israel, his second visit since the Hamas attack. US citizens were boarding an evacuation ship at the port of Haifa which would take them today to Limassol in Cyprus.
Joe Biden has cancelled a planned trip to Colorado, opting to stay in Washington DC to focus on national security meetings.
Leaders of all 27 countries in the EU have called for the “immediate and unconditional” release of all the hostages. The leaders will tomorrow meet via video link for an emergency summit called over the weekend as fears rise across the EU over the volatility in the Middle East. In a strongly worded statement, the European Council president, Charles Michel, said the EU defended Israel’s right to defend itself but said it must be “in full compliance with international law and international humanitarian law”.
Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on Monday in a televised press conference that “Iran considers that the US is already militarily involved in the conflict”.
China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, has called for a ceasefire, saying: “The UN security council must take action, and the major powers should play an active role. It is imperative that a ceasefire be put in place, that the two sides be brought back to the negotiating table, and that an emergency humanitarian channel be established to prevent a further humanitarian disaster.”
Rishi Sunak has said six British nationals have been killed in Israel and a further 10 are missing, some of whom are believed to have been killed. He described the Hamas attack as a pogrom.
Visiting a Jewish school in north London, Sunak said: “Israel has been very clear that Hamas is the entity that’s responsible for this and what they want to do is ensure that their people are safe and that this doesn’t happen again, and that the focus of the attention of self-defence is on Hamas. I’ve raised with the Israeli prime minister the need to minimise the impact on civilians as best we can. I’ve raised the humanitarian situation. We will continue to do that with other allies around the region as well.”
Denmark has decided to send a navy frigate to join Nato’s naval force in the eastern Mediterranean to prepare for possible evacuations.
Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will travel to Israel on Tuesday.

Iran warns of ‘pre-emptive action’ as Gaza ground assault looms – as it happened,2023-10-17,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/16/israel-hamas-war-live-update-news-today-gaza-water-fuel-aid-egypt-border-rafah-crossing-latest-updates,"This blog is low closed.

US President Joe Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and to make clear Israel has the right to defend itself, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Tuesday.Biden will reaffirm solidarity with Israel as it prepares for a ground offensive against Hamas militants in Gaza, Blinken said after lengthy talks with Netanyahu.
We have launched a new blog at the link below and will now be closing this one – follow this link for the latest:
AFP: Following days of confusing and sometimes contradictory messaging about the EU’s stance on the developing Israel-Hamas conflict, leaders of the bloc’s countries on Tuesday are to try to rally around a clear statement.
“We felt the need to bring some order,” one EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue more freely.
A videoconference of the leaders, taking place at 15.30 GMT and chaired by European Council President Charles Michel, will seek to supersede initial steps taken by the European Commission and its chief, Ursula von der Leyen.
Von der Leyen last Friday flew to Israel to tell its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Europe backed Israel‘s right to defend itself.
But that message was delivered without the caution being voiced by other Western leaders, and by the EU’s own top foreign policy official Josep Borrell, that Israeli action must abide by international humanitarian law.
Several EU governments bristled at von der Leyen taking it on herself to wade into foreign policy matters, which are decided by member countries, without prior consultation and straying from their national positions.
The top US general overseeing American forces in the Middle East made an unannounced trip to Israel on Tuesday, saying he hoped to ensure its military has what it needs as it fights a deepening war against Palestinian militant group Hamas.The trip by Army General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, head of US Central Command, is the latest by a senior US official to Israel ahead of an expected ground assault by Israel‘s military in Gaza. It comes a day before a planned visit by US President Joe Biden to the country.The US military is increasing its firepower in the region, aiming to prevent Iran and other Iran-backed groups from getting involved in the conflict as international fears of a wider, regional war grow.The Pentagon is also rushing weaponry, including air defenses and munitions, to Israel.“I’m here to ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself, particularly focused on avoiding other parties expanding the conflict,” Kurilla told Reuters, which is traveling with him, in brief remarks before landing.A US official told Reuters Kurilla was scheduled to hold high-level meetings with Israel’s military leadership, ensuring a clear understanding of the close US ally’s defense requirements.Kurilla was also expected to outline US military support aimed at avoiding an expansion of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
The IAF has posted a video showing what it claims are strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.
“A short while ago, the IAF struck terror targets and military infrastructure of the Hezbollah terrorist organisation in Lebanon, in response to fire yesterday (Monday) towards Israel,” the IAF wrote on X.

Palestinian Australians in the West Bank who fear a surge in violence have raised concerns over the Australian government’s efforts to help them escape the region, after rescue buses to Jordan were cancelled.
With no airport in the West Bank, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) had scheduled buses to take Australian citizens from the Palestinian city of Ramallah over the border into Jordan, due to concerns about the ability of these dual nationals to access flights out of Israel’s Ben Gurion airport.
Dfat had intended to run buses on Monday and Tuesday morning, however these did not proceed, the Guardian understands. Officials will attempt to run another bus service on Wednesday.
In case you missed this earlier, a top Hamas leader said on Monday the group “has what it needs” to free all Palestinians in Israel’s jails, indicating the militant group may try to use the Israelis it kidnapped as bargaining chips to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.Soon after Hamas official Khaled Meshaal made the remarks on the captives, the group’s armed wing separately said the non-Israelis were “guests” who would be released “when circumstances allow”.Israel’s military says the group is holding hostages from 199 families in Gaza – in other words, it has alerted 199 families that they have one or more loves ones being held hostage. Hamas says it has between 200 and 250 hostages.Hamas, which like other factions has long called for the release of the roughly 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons, “has what it needs to empty the prisons of all prisoners,” Meshaal, a former Hamas chief who now heads its diaspora office in Doha, told AlAraby TV.In 2011, Israel swapped hundreds of Palestinian prisoners to win the release of one Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, who was held for five years. That kind of exchange - which at the time was criticised by some Israelis as too lopsided - looks an impossible bargain with dozens of people being held.
Around 500,000 Israelis have been evacuated and displaced in the 10 days since Hamas unleashed the bloodiest attack in the country’s history, the Israeli military said Tuesday.
“There are about half a million internally displaced Israelis at the time,” Jonathan Conricus, spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said in an online briefing.
He pointed out that all communities around the Gaza Strip had been evacuated, as had more than 20 communities along Israel‘s northern border with Lebanon.
More now on what has come out of Blinken’s meeting with Netanyahu regarding aid:
Blinken said that the United States also secured assurances from Israel on working to bring foreign assistance into the impoverished and blockaded Gaza Strip as Israel prepares a ground offensive against the Hamas-ruled territory.
US officials said that a new US coordinator on humanitarian aid, David Satterfield, would work with Israel to develop more concrete plans.
Biden hopes to “hear from Israel how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimises civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not benefit Hama,” Blinken said.
“At our request, the United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza,” Blinken said.
He said the two sides were discussing the “possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm’s way.”
“We welcome the government of Israel’s commitment to work on this plan. The president very much looks forward to discussing it further when he’s here on Wednesday,” he said.
The decision for Joe Biden to travel to Israel has not been “taken lightly”, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said in his statement earlier.
“Obviously we would not be making the trip if we did not believe proper security measures were in place,” Kirby said.
NBC reports Kirby told reporters that Biden’s travel to Israel was thoroughly evaluated, but that the “security situation is certainly tense.”
On Monday, a meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and US secretary of state, Antony Blinken was disrupted by air raid sirens warning of incoming Palestinian rocket fire, forcing them to briefly shelter in a bunker.
Here is a quick recap following that IDF update and the news from Biden and Blinken:
US President Joe Biden will travel to Israel and on to Jordan Wednesday to meet with both Israeli and Arab leadership, as concerns increase that the raging Israel-Hamas war could expand into a larger regional conflict. Biden said on X, “On Wednesday, I’ll travel to Israel to stand in solidarity in the face of Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack.”
Biden is looking to send the strongest message yet that the US is behind Israel. Blinken made the announcement early Tuesday after more than seven hours of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials. “He is coming here at a critical moment for Israel, for the region and for the world,” Blinken said.
Shortly after in Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced that Biden would also go to Jordan to meet with King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss humanitarian needs. “We’ve been crystal clear about the need for humanitarian aid to be able to continue to flow into Gaza,” Kirby said. “That has been a consistent call by President Biden and certainly by this entire administration.”
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States and Israel had agreed to develop a plan to get humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza without benefiting Hamas, and that President Joe Biden would visit Israel this week to hear how it would minimize civilian casualties in its war effort. Blinken made the announcement after hours of negotiations with Netanyahu that stretched into the early hours of Tuesday.
Washington Post reporter John Hudson reported that he had been told by a source that Blinken delayed announcing Biden’s visit to Tel Aviv until Netanyahu had made commitments on a humanitarian package.
Meanwhile IDF spokeperson Jonathan Conricus said that 199 families have now been notified that their loved ones are being held hostage. It is an increase of 40 families, from 155 notified at the time of the last update, he said. He did not say how many hostages this translates to. The increase is not because more hostages being taken but because new information comes to light allowing people to be taken off the list of missing and confirmed as hostages.
Asked whether Biden’s visit will delay ground operations, Conricus said that he does not know, but that he does not think it will. The aim of Biden’s visit is not to “hinder” Israeli operations, he said. “It is to minimise the chances of a regional escalation.”
Conricus said he does not believe that there is any plan for Israel to ultimately “hold onto the Gaza strip”.
The IDF spokesperson was asked during that briefing what there is to stop Hamas fighters going south, too. He said this is “very difficult” and is “one of the downsides” of Israel advertising that it is going to commence enhanced military operations and telling civilians where to go.
600,000 Palestinians have moved south and that there are still 100,000 people who need to go, the IDF spokesperson said.
The “enhanced military operations” will commence “when the timing suits the goal” said Conricus. The aim of the war remains to “completely dismantle Hamas and its military capabilities”. He said, “our preparations continue in the south”, that the IDF is “actively searching for the places where Hammas commanders are hiding” and, “We continue to prepare ourselves for enhanced military operations in Gaza”. The IDF is active on the northern border, the border with Lebanon, but “not escalating” the situation, he said.

Most of the hostages are civilians, he said.
On Monday Hamas said that there were between 200 and 250 hostages.

Family and friends of Australians fleeing conflict in Israel have begun gathering to welcome them at Sydney Airport.
All up, 222 people were due to land at 1755 on Tuesday on the DFAT-supported flight from Tel Aviv via Dubai. It is the first repatriation flight to Australia.
Among the passengers are the teenage niece and nephew of Ayelet Nussbaum, from Glebe, whose brother and family moved to Haifa in 2021. Here’s what she told Guardian Australia:
This is the third flight they tried to get on and we’re very relieved - we were very nervous.
But it’s mixed feelings. (Her brother, his wife and their youngest child remain in Haifa)
My brother is very patriotic and very involved socially. He is not ready to leave. Being there is part of who he is. I don’t blame him even though it’s hard for us.
She was joined at the airport by her children, Mya Nussbaum, 10, and Adam Nussbaum, 13, and her parents, Shai and Dina Thaler.
The Qatar-operated flight is the first of three government-assisted repatriation flights due to land from Israel via London and Dubai over the next 48 hours.
ASX rally fades in wake of hawkish Reserve Bank minutes
The Australian share market has finished higher, but a stronger rally faded after the release of hawkish Reserve Bank minutes indicating another interest rate hike this year is still possible.
The ASX200 had been up as much 1.05% by late morning amid efforts by the international community to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East, but gave up some of those gains after the release of minutes from the RBA’s last meeting indicating that board members were open to another rate hike next month.
The board believes most households and businesses are managing to adjust to higher interest rates, the minutes showed, and board members are concerned about the upside risks of inflation:
The RBA minutes had a more hawkish stance when compared to previous RBA communications:
The board has a low tolerance for a slower return of inflation to target than currently expected.

Outcome of David Van allegations referral to be finalised but PWSS will not reveal details
Earlier today during senate question time, we heard from former Liberal-turned-independent senator David Van.
Peter Dutton removed Van from the Liberal party room in June after multiple inappropriate touching allegations were made against him. Van has denied all the allegations.
The opposition leader also revealed he had made a referral to the parliamentary workplace support system to have a look at the claims alleged to have occurred within Parliament House.
It’s expected the outcome of that referral will be finalised soon, but PWSS will not reveal any details about it. A spokesperson for the PWSS told Guardian Australia it doesn’t confirm or deny whether it has looked into matters referred to the body.
“In keeping with the privacy and confidentiality principles which underpin the service, the PWSS does not comment on whether or not it has had involvement in workplace matters.” the spokesperson said.
“It is very important that people are not deterred from engaging with the PWSS over concerns about how their information will be used.”
New commissioner for Victorian corruption watchdog
Victoria’s corruption watchdog has a new woman in charge - a year after her predecessor finished up.
The state government announced Victoria Elliot as the new commissioner for the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission.
Elliot will start her five-year term on December 16, taking over from action commissioner Stephen Farrow. Previous commissioner Robert Redlich’s five-year term came to an end on December 16, 2022.
Towards the end of his time as commissioner, Mr Redlich became a vocal critic of the Daniel Andrews Labor government and its attempts to minimise investigation findings and the growing problem of ‘grey corruption’ - unethical practices that did not meet the legal threshold of a criminal offence.

Labor senator says price tag for Israel’s right to defend itself ‘cannot be the destruction of Palestine’ and calls for condemnation
The Labor senator Fatima Payman has used a speech in the upper house to condemn Israel’s military action in Gaza and urged her colleagues to join her.
Yesterday, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, recognised Israel’s right to defend itself, but also urged the Netanyahu government to “operate by the rules of war” amid increasing expectations of an imminent ground operation in Gaza.
Here’s a section of Payman’s short speech, which goes much further than the prime minister’s comments this week:
The killing of innocent civilians in Israel should be condemned and we condemn it. The killing of innocent civilians in Palestine should also be condemned. We must condemn it.
Israeli missile strike residential dwellings, civilians, multi-story apartments, health facilities as well as places of worship, indiscriminately killing men, women and children. We must condemn it.
The price tag of Israel’s right to defend itself cannot be the destruction of Palestine. Israel’s right to defend its civilians cannot equate the annihilation of Palestinian civilians.
I am feeling the pain of all those in Gaza without water, food, electricity or safety and all those families who have lost loved ones including children. pic.twitter.com/Ai47wtrHUu
NSW Liberals briefed on state election loss post-mortem
A post-mortem of the New South Wales Liberals election defeat in March has pointed to the damage done by the Morrison government’s record on climate change, women and integrity, party infighting and dysfunction.
The report also pointed to the impact of the John Barilaro saga.
Seven months on from the Coalition’s loss to Labor, the internal review by former NSW premier Nick Greiner and former NSW MP Peta Seaton found the government’s “longevity” and an “it’s time” factor after 12 years contributed to the loss.
Liberal MPs were briefed on the review during Tuesday’s party room meeting by Greiner and Seaton.
People in attendance told the Guardian, on the condition of anonymity, that there was nothing “overly spicy” or surprising about the findings that highlighted the state party’s links to former prime minister Scott Morrison and NSW Nationals leader John Barilaro. Here’s how one source put it:
It was probably a good summary of what we already knew in terms of what went wrong. It was longevity, it was a lot of infighting on our end, delayed preselections, factions fighting with each other.
Major spending cuts for country’s biggest council, Brisbane City
A $400m hit to Australia’s biggest council’s budget will see proposed “green bridges” scrapped in a bid to improve the bottom line, along with cuts to advertising, consultants and travel costs, as AAP reports.
Just months after July’s $4.3bn budget, Brisbane’s lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, confirmed the council would cut spending by 10% until June 30. Schrinner cited global inflation and an ongoing cost-of-living crisis for the sudden cuts that will affect projects and services run by Australia’s largest council by population.
Affected projects include the green bridge program which provides pedestrian and cycle links with public transport. The Toowong to West End stage is now on hold.
Cuts will also hit the Brisbane Metro transit service, which is expected to be operational in 2024, with a public art requirement removed. Shading set for the Victoria Bridge as part of the Brisbane Metro project has also been paused. But there will be no redundancies and waste collection services won’t be affected.
Here’s how Schrinner put it:
Just like many households, we’re making the responsible decision to reduce council spending by 10% to avoid driving up costs for residents.
We’re being upfront about this tough decision but make no apology for prioritising keeping costs down for households.
On that note, I am going to hand over the blog to Henry Belot who will take you through the evening. I’ll be back at sparrows tomorrow to help guide you through another parliamentary sitting day. Make sure you check back with the team to see what they have done in the meantime – and please, take care of you.
I mean it.
The Bowers-eye view of question time
Here is how our very own Mike Bowers saw QT:
NSW police release further CCTV footage of alleged assault during pro-Palestine rally
New South Wales police have released more CCTV footage from last Monday’s pro-Palestine rally in Sydney after a man was allegedly assaulted at the Opera House.
Police said the 45-year-old allegedly became involved in an argument with a group of men about 7.30pm on Monday during which he was allegedly assaulted and spat on.
Officers intervened and the group dispersed and left the area before the alleged victim then reported the assault, police said.
Police have released images captured on CCTV of five people they say may be able to assist them with their investigation into the alleged incident.
The force on Monday released CCTV footage of another man who attended the rally as they investigate the protest under Strike Force Mealing.
Liberal MP says it will be a ‘long time’ before another referendum occurs
Liberal MP Keith Wolahan gave an interesting contribution, saying “it’ll be a long time before we have another one [referendum] again”. That comment made our ears prick up, considering the furore today over whether Peter Dutton would do another referendum on symbolic constitutional recognition or whether he won’t:
We may never again in this parliament, however long we’re here, have an MPI after a referendum.
Considering some MPs spend decades in the chamber, we may not be holding our breath for the Liberals to advance a constitutional change of their own anytime soon. An MPI is a Matter for Public Importance, by the way, a way for MPs to debate about something, usually following question time (and usually fired off by the opposition).
Wolahan was deputy chair of a parliamentary committee examining the proposed constitutional amendment – which controversially only went for six weeks, as ordered by the government. He derided it as a “ticking exercise”, calling it a “mistake” for the process to be run the way it was.
Voice fallout continues in the House
Going back to the MPI in the House on the voice referendum, Labor MP Daniel Mulino branded as “completely disingenuous” claims from the Coalition there could have been more bipartisanship on the referendum. He questioned why they hadn’t progressed the Uluru statement when they were in government; then went on to call the opposition’s demands for an audit of Indigenous spending “dog whistling” and “absolutely pathetic”.
Next the call went to Barnaby Joyce. He revived the infamous Shaquille O’Neal press conference with PM Anthony Albanese last year, laughing and crowing “what a joke” (PS learning more about Shaq’s involvement in the referendum is still my ‘white whale’ story. If you know more, my DMs are always open)
Fremantle MP Josh Wilson came afetrward, saying “I’m sorry Australia didn’t vote yes”.
We put the referendum in the terms Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people asked for, through the most comprehensive referendum constitutional process that’s ever occurred.”
Wilson said that whichever way the vote went, “the work of reconciliation and closing the gap had to continue ... It wasn’t going to be done with a yes vote and it isn’t done with a no vote.”

Humza Yousaf’s wife says her young cousins in Gaza have shrapnel injuries,2023-10-17,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/17/humza-yousafs-wife-says-her-young-cousins-in-gaza-have-shrapnel-injuries,"Nadia El-Nakla, wife of Scotland’s first minister, says her mother is trying to treat children but household has run out of clean water
Nadia El-Nakla, the wife of Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, has said three of her young cousins from Gaza, including a two-year-old, have shrapnel injuries after an Israeli drone missile hit near them.
Speaking to the Guardian on Tuesday an hour before her husband made his closing address to the Scottish National party’s annual conference, El-Nakla said her mother had called her with the news, “really shaken and really upset”, just before the interview began.
El-Nakla’s parents, Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla, who live in Dundee, travelled to Gaza earlier this month to visit their son and four grandchildren as well as Maged’s 92-year-old mother, who is unwell.
“[My mother] called about 20 minutes ago to say that my aunt and uncle were outside with the kids,” El-Nakla said. “I’m still trying to seek clarity from my mum about this, because she was so upset, but she said they got hit when a missile drone hit off metal. So thankfully it didn’t hit them directly, but the kids – especially the two-year-old – have a lot of shrapnel under their skin.”
El-Nakla said her mother, a former nurse, was now trying to treat the children using tweezers that she had in her holiday packing, and she was concerned about the risk of infection.
Her parents have been trapped in the city of Deir al-Balah since Hamas gunmen massacred more than 1,300 mostly civilian Israelis 10 days ago.
Since then, El-Nakla, a psychotherapist and SNP councillor for Dundee, and her husband have shared in brutal detail the day-to-day impact of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza that followed those shock attacks.
Yousaf has continued to urge the UK government to push for the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians and let supplies and aid into the territory, and shared moving clips of his mother-in-law pleading for help on behalf of her family and neighbours.
El-Nakla said her mother had texted her earlier in the morning to report that the household had run out of clean water. “The only water they have now is salty. That really upset me because obviously that can also make people sick. There’s no electricity and no hospital facilities,” she said.
“The humanitarian crisis is very real,” she went on. “Actually nowhere is safe in Gaza. People are starting to go to the hospitals to sleep outside because they think that a hospital won’t be hit in the night.”
El-Nakla said her parents had remained at the family home in Deir al-Balah, in the middle of Gaza, after the Israeli army ordered 1.1 million people to evacuate to the south of the strip.
“My worry is that they’ve asked people to go from the north to the south, which is closer to the Egyptian border, with that invisible barrier being Deir al-Balah, where my parents are from. If the Israeli military are planning on continuing to move more people south, the next area will be my parents’,” she said.
“I asked them: what is your plan if you’re asked to leave? And they came back saying ‘we don’t have one, we’ll have nowhere to go’.
“I really don’t know where they would go so I’m just desperately praying that that doesn’t happen. My gran is 93 and in a wheelchair. We’re not talking about paved roads, we’re talking about dust. And I also have an eight-week-old nephew – how can you keep him in the sun outside?”
El-Nakla said she was disappointed that there had not been more discussion of the “genuine facilitation of peace” in Westminster on Tuesday.
“For me, there’s three things that must happen. There’s facilitating a ceasefire, immediately. There’s the opening of humanitarian corridors, immediately. They’re on their knees, there’s no medical supplies and they’re running out of food. And the third one is to allow foreign nationals [to leave] and to let out those that can seek safety elsewhere.”
She said she had been heartbroken by reports of the Hamas attacks on Israeli homes and the Supernova music festival.
“I can only imagine how terrifying that must have been … My heart broke for all those families and for all those people that were scared for their lives. And then also at the back of my mind was heartbreak at the repercussions that will follow this.”
During his conference speech, Yousaf called on the UK government to support the medical evacuation of injured civilians in Gaza, adding: “Scotland is ready to play her part and our hospitals will treat the injured men, women and children of Gaza where we can.”
He called on Westminster to begin immediate work on a refugee resettlement scheme for people from Gaza who wished to leave the territory.

Australia breaches WHO treaty with carbon neutral certification of big tobacco company ,2023-10-19,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/20/australia-breaches-who-treaty-with-carbon-neutral-certification-of-big-tobacco-company,"Endorsement of British American Tobacco by Climate Active was revoked after complaint was made, FoI documents show
The government has been forced to revoke carbon neutral certification given to a big tobacco company after the endorsement was found to be in breach of a World Health Organization treaty to which Australia is a signatory.
Freedom of information documents show a complaint was made by the managing director of the Carbon Reduction Institute, Rob Cawthorne, to the health department in August 2022 about British American Tobacco (BAT) receiving the certification from Climate Active.
Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup
A government-backed carbon neutral certification scheme, Climate Active is managed by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. It offers certifications for organisations who can show they are making efforts to achieve carbon neutrality. Those organisations can then use the certification trademark.
In his complaint, Cawthorne wrote: “The certification itself could have the effect of saying smoking is not so bad because it causes no impact on our climate.”
Australia is a signatory to the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control [FCTC], which means the government must protect its policies from interference from the tobacco industry and its interests.
Among many clauses, the FCTC states that government consultation with the tobacco industry should be limited to measures needed for public officials or agencies to enact effective tobacco control; that action should be taken to de-normalise the tobacco industry’s “socially responsible” activities; and thatpartnerships with the tobacco industry should be rejected.
The documents show that after being alerted to the complaint, the health department’s director of tobacco control advised the Department of Industry that “promotion of the tobacco industry’s carbon-neutral operations could be perceived as a corporate social responsibility activity and government endorsement could be in contravention of the FCTC”.
The director noted “the ‘greenwashing’ tactic used by the tobacco industry globally”.
Greenwashing is described by the University of Bath’s Tobacco Tactics watchdog as harmful or controversial industries marketing themselves as environmentally friendly in a bid to divert public attention from their environmentally damaging practices.
A report on tobacco industry greenwashing co-authored by the World Health Organization found that “at every step of production, the tobacco industry has an impact on the environment”.
“It could be argued that the tobacco industry has attempted to greenwash its reputation and products through programs such as beach clean-ups, and funding environmental and disaster-relief organisations,” the report says.
“This practice is especially true in low- and middle-income countries that tobacco companies target to increase sales and profits. In recent years, as the tobacco industry has tried even harder to rehabilitate its image, the evidence suggests its greenwashing activities and promotion has increased.”
Becky Freeman, a professor of public health and tobacco-control expert, said the certification served “only to polish the tarnished reputation of an industry that annually kills more than 8 million people around the globe”.
“To then accredit this company as a champion of protecting the future health of our planet is laughable.”
Harmful industries should never be eligible for government-backed endorsements, Freeman said.

“If your business model relies on lifelong addiction and is responsible for millions of preventable early deaths, no amount of greenwashing can make up for that.”
Climate Active has itself been accused of greenwashing by former chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Prof Allan Fels, who told a Senate inquiry in July that the program was guilty of “misleading and deceptive conduct” through accepting the purchase of offsets as a “carbon neutral” activity, instead of requiring actual cuts in emissions.
There is no record of the BAT certification under the Climate Active website list of previously certified brands.
An environment department spokesperson said it was officially revoked on 9 December, and that Climate Active standards were updated to exclude tobacco-related organisations.
Hansard records show that in February, Greens senator Sarah Hanson Young asked environment department officials about the Climate Active scheme and if officials were “worried that some of the certifications are not legitimate”.
The department’s deputy secretary, Jo Evans, responded that “certainly issues have arisen over the last few years where we’ve questioned ourselves,” citing the example of certifying BAT.
“On reflection and on advice from the department of health we made a decision that that probably wasn’t an appropriate certification, so we rectified that one,” she said.
BAT was approached for comment.
 This article was amended on 20 October 2023. An earlier version said the Climate Active scheme was managed by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources. It is managed by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.

 Egypt’s president agrees to open the Rafah crossing – as it happened,2023-10-19,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/18/israel-hamas-war-live-news-gaza-hospital-west-bank-update-joe-biden-visit-protests-latest-updates,"This blog is now closed.
Here is what we know about the desperately-needed aid being allowed into Gaza.
Israel said Wednesday that it will allow Egypt to deliver limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.
The announcement to allow water, food and other supplies happened as fury over the blast at Gaza City’s al-Ahli Hospital spread across the Middle East, and as US President Joe Biden visited Israel in hopes of preventing a wider conflict in the region.
Biden said Egypt’s president agreed to open the crossing and to let in an initial group of 20 trucks with humanitarian aid. If Hamas confiscates aid, “it will end,” he said.
The aid will start moving Friday at the earliest, White House officials said.
Egypt must still repair the road across the border that was cratered by Israeli airstrikes. More than 200 trucks and some 3,000 tons of aid are positioned at or near the Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only connection to Egypt, said the head of the Red Crescent for North Sinai, Khalid Zayed.
Supplies will go in under supervision of the UN, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told Al-Arabiya TV. Asked if foreigners and dual nationals seeking to leave would be let through, he said: “As long as the crossing is operating normally and the (crossing) facility has been repaired.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the decision was approved after a request from Biden. It said Israel “will not thwart” deliveries of food, water or medicine from Egypt, as long as they are limited to civilians in the south of the Gaza Strip and don’t go to Hamas militants.
Israel’s statement made no mention of fuel, which is badly needed for hospital generators.
This blog is closing shortly. We have launched a new blog at the link below.
The Australian government has updated its travel advice for Lebanon to “do not travel”, citing, “the volatile security situation and the risk of the security situation deteriorating further.”
The move follows similar advisories from the US and UK governments.
Here is our wrap of the latest in the conflict:
About 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid will enter Gaza from Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula in the coming days, according to the White House, after President Joe Biden’s whirlwind visit to Israel that came in the aftermath of a deadly blast at a hospital in the besieged enclave.
Following hours of talks with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet, Biden said Israel had agreed to allow the opening of the Egypt-Gaza Rafah crossing to deliveries of desperately needed food, water and medical supplies on condition that the humanitarian assistance was not diverted by Hamas for its own use.
“The people of Gaza need food, water, medicine and shelter,” Biden said, while vowing to continue to provide for Israel’s security needs and supporting Israel’s assessment that the explosion at the al-Ahli Hospital on Tuesday night was not the result of an Israeli airstrike, but of “an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza”.
Here are some recent pictures:
AFP: Biden, asked by journalists about reports that his administration had told Israel that US forces would fight alongside Israeli troops in response to any attack by the powerful Lebanese movement Hezbollah against Israel, said this was “not true.”
However, he said that “our military is talking with their military about what the alternatives are” in the event of a Hezbollah attack.
China’s President Xi Jinping has meanwhile met with Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) said.
Here is more of what Biden said about the opening of the Rafah border crossing, via AFP:
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi “agreed to... let up to 20 trucks through to begin with,” Biden told reporters after calling Sisi from Air Force One while returning from a visit to Israel, where he was showing solidarity over the 7 October Hamas attacks.
The shipment would likely not cross until Friday, as the road at the crossing needed repairs, Biden said.
“They’re going to patch the road. They have to fill in potholes to get these trucks through. And that’s going to occur - they expect it’ll take about eight hours tomorrow,” he said.
The first 20 trucks will be a test of a system for distributing aid without allowing the Palestinian militant organization Hamas, which controls Gaza, to benefit, the US president said.
The United Nations is set to distribute aid on the Gaza side of the border.
“If Hamas confiscates it or doesn’t let it get through or just confiscates it, then it’s going to end, because we’re not going to be sending any humanitarian aid to Hamas if they’re going to be confiscating it. That’s the commitment that I’ve made,” Biden said.
He added that the 20 trucks represented a “first tranche,” but “150 or something” trucks are waiting in total. Whether the rest are allowed to cross will depend on “how it goes.”
He said he had instead talked to Sisi from Air Force One for about half an hour.
“The bottom line is that he (Sisi) deserves some real credit because he was very accommodating,” the US president added.
Biden characterised his trip to the war zone as a success and said that while expressing US support for ally Israel, he was “very blunt with the Israelis” on the need to allow aid into Gaza.
“If you have an opportunity to alleviate the pain, you should do it. Period. And if you don’t, you’re going to lose credibility worldwide. And I think everyone understands that,” he said.
Egypt has agreed to allow aid to pass through the Rafah border crossing to Gaza. Rafah is in Egypt’s Sinai region. It is also the only exit point for Gaza residents seeking to flee their home. Foreign passport holders are expected to be allowed out under any deal to reopen the crossing, and have therefore headed in recent days to the vicinity, seeking to exit.
But Egypt is wary of insecurity near the border with Gaza in northeastern Sinai, where it faced an Islamist insurgency that peaked after 2013 and has now largely been suppressed.
Despite telling people to flee Gaza City for the south, which includes Rafah, Israel has launched airstrikes on buildings in Rafah in recent days.
Biden said Egypt’s president agreed to open the crossing and to let in an initial group of 20 trucks with humanitarian aid. If Hamas confiscates aid, “it will end,” he said. The aid will start moving Friday at the earliest, White House officials said.
Egypt must still repair the road across the border that was cratered by Israeli airstrikes.
More than 200 trucks and some 3,000 tons of aid are positioned at or near the Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only connection to Egypt, said the head of the Red Crescent for North Sinai, Khalid Zayed.
Since Hamas took control in Gaza in 2007, Egypt has helped enforce a blockade of the enclave and heavily restricted the flow of people and goods. Like the main crossings with Israel, restrictions have sometimes been eased but not lifted, and travellers need security clearance and lengthy checks to pass. In 2008, tens of thousands of Palestinians crossed into Sinai after Hamas blasted holes in border fortifications, prompting Egypt to build a stone and cement wall.Egypt has acted as a mediator between Israel and Palestinian factions during past conflicts and periods of unrest. But in those situations it has also locked down the border, allowing aid to enter and medical evacuees to leave but preventing any large-scale movement of people.Even as Israel pursues its heaviest and most unrelenting bombardment of Gaza in response to the Hamas assault, Egypt has shown no sign so far that its approach will change. More than 2,800 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombing strikes.
That update is over.
The IDF is now delivering its update, which appears to be focused on the explosion at al-Ahli al-Arabi Hospital on Tuesday. We will bring you any relevant new information.
So far IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus is repeating claims previously released by the IDF, including what Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Wednesday.
The misfired rocket hit the parking lot outside the hospital, he said. Were it an airstrike, there would have been a large crater there; instead, the fiery blast came from the misfired rocket’s warhead and its unspent propellant, he said.
We’re not sure why the IDF update seems to be delayed by half an hour, but we’ll bring it to you when it starts.
More now from Biden’s meeting with Netanyahu and Israeli defence officials.
Axios reports that when the US president “pressed officials about their overall strategy in Gaza — namely, what Israel’s plan for the enclave would be after the war”, they said that they weren’t “there yet” and were focussed on the counteroffensive.
Residents and doctors in Khan Younis, a town southern Gaza – the area to which the IDF said people in Gaza City should flee – said an airstrike slammed into a home, killing seven small children, the Associated Press reports.
The news spread quickly on social media, as images of dead and bloodied toddlers lined up side by side on a hospital stretcher stirred outrage in Gaza and the West Bank.
Bandaged and caked in dust, the bodies were brought to the Gaza European Hospital in Khan Younis along with three other dead members of the Bakri family. Photographers entered the operation room as women covered their eyes and doctors wept.
“This is a massacre,” hospital director Dr. Yousef Al-Akkad said, his voice choking with emotion. “Let the world see, these are just children.”
Local medics also confirmed that the children were killed in a strike and said the Bakri family was just one of many such cases Wednesday.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.

"Methane bubbles in groundwater cast doubts over Beetaloo basin fracking approval, scientists say",2023-10-19,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/20/methane-bubbles-in-groundwater-cast-doubts-over-beetaloo-basin-fracking-approval-scientists-say,"Experts warn the NT government has ‘significant and critical gaps in the knowledge base underpinning fracking approvals’
Experts have cast doubt on groundwater studies that underpin the Northern Territory government’s decision to permit fracking in the Beetaloo basin, after methane bubbles were observed at hot springs in an area targeted for gas production.
In a new report, commissioned by the Environment Centre NT (ECNT), the scientists warn of “critical knowledge gaps” in baseline groundwater assessments conducted by the government in response to the Pepper inquiry into fracking.
Ninety percent of the territory’s water supply comes from groundwater while the territory’s hot springs support ecosystems and Indigenous cultural values.
“Our analysis shows that there are significant and critical gaps in the knowledge base underpinning fracking approvals in the Northern Territory,” said Matt Currell, a professor of environmental engineering at Griffith University and lead author of the report commissioned by the ECNT.
“This means that, at present, it is not possible to properly assess the risk of contamination and over-extraction of Northern Territory water due to fracking.
“Further studies are required to fill these knowledge gaps. To proceed on the current evidence base would be unwise, and may risk valuable aquifers, rivers and springs.”

Of particular concern, the authors found the government had failed to properly determine where the groundwater that flows to important springs comes from. They said the baseline studies lacked clear data on potential connectivity between shallow and deeper aquifers.
The authors said the government had also failed to develop a thorough profile of water quality throughout the groundwater systems. This would help establish whether there was a risk that saline water found at deeper levels, for example, could contaminate freshwater at shallow levels.
Currell also pointed to studies at hot springs on Tanumbirini station – an area targeted by gas companies.
“The discovery of methane bubbling to the surface at hot springs is particularly concerning, as it suggests connections between the shale gas layer to be targeted for fracking and surface water,” he said.
“This could become a pathway for contamination of water relied upon by communities in the Northern Territory.”
A spokesperson for the NT environment, parks and water security department defended the studies which, combined with the fracking inquiry, had made the Beetaloo region “the most extensively studied in the Territory across land, water and biodiversity, with a comprehensive focus on water”.
In a letter to the NT environment minister, Lauren Moss, six environment groups urged the government to put further fracking approvals and finalisation of a water allocation plan for the Beetaloo region on hold until it addressed “16 critical knowledge gaps” identified in Currell’s report and had its baseline studies peer-reviewed.
“We have repeatedly been assured by the NT government that the science underpinning its decision to greenlight fracking is sound,” the executive director of the ECNT, Kirsty Howey, said.
“Now we learn that baseline water studies are slipshod and seriously flawed, with holes so big you could drive a truck through them.

“All fracking approvals and water allocations for fracking must be put on hold until the federal government ensures that the water trigger is in place, and baseline studies are completed and peer reviewed.”
The water trigger requires the environment minister to consider the impact of large coal and coal seam gas proposals on local water resources.
Djingili elder and director of Nurrdalinji Aboriginal Corporation, Elaine Sandy, said “we have a responsibility to protect water, for our communities and everyone living here”.
“If fracking damages our water it can never be put right,” she said.
The letter calls for activities to be put on hold until the NT government established water advisory committees for the Beetaloo region and the federal government expanded the water trigger under national environmental laws.
The Albanese government has promised to expand the water trigger to include the shale gas in the Beetaloo basin as part of environmental reforms that have been delayed until next year. The Greens and independent MP Sophie Scamps have introduced their own bills to pressure the government to act before the end of the year.
The NT government’s spokesperson said investigations, led by CSIRO, would continue on the Hot Springs Valley located on Tanumbirini Station.
The spokesperson said a summary that synthesised the findings of the baseline assessments had been externally reviewed by two experts who sat on the panel of the inquiry into fracking.
They said the dataset for the Beetaloo region would continue to grow as a result of monitoring through government programs and by petroleum companies operating in the region.

"Australia needs ‘drastic’ renewables boost as nuclear not an option for decades, says centre-right thinktank",2023-10-19,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/19/australia-needs-drastic-renewables-boost-as-nuclear-not-an-option-for-decades-says-centre-right-thinktank,"Exclusive: Blueprint Institute says nuclear ban should be lifted, but disagrees with Coalition opposition to green energy rollout
A centre-right thinktank is calling for “drastically accelerated deployment” of renewable energy, batteries and electricity transmission infrastructure and acknowledged there is no prospect of nuclear energy playing a role in Australia before 2040.
The report by the Blueprint Institute, not yet released but seen in draft form by Guardian Australia, says the ban on nuclear energy should be repealed and argues small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) could play a “small but vital role” in minimising costs in reaching net zero emissions in the power grid by 2050.
The report, due to be published soon, is set to land during a polarised debate about the future of energy and the pace of decarbonisation.
The Coalition and parts of the media have attacked the Albanese government’s renewable energy policy and have called for the rollout to be slowed, a position at odds with scientific warnings that emissions cuts need to accelerate. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has suggested SMRs could be built on the site of old coal plants.
The Blueprint Institute report says reaching the government’s target of 82% renewable energy by 2030 will be a major challenge, but does not provide support for those challenging the goal. It says the country has “no choice, at least in the short-term”, but to “double down on renewable energy” and proven “firming” technology to avoid “calamitous blackouts” as old coal plants close.
“This means a drastically accelerated deployment of batteries, solar, onshore wind, pumped hydro, and gas, along with a corresponding build out of transmission infrastructure,” the report says.
The report says the potential role of nuclear energy in Australia is “strictly limited to a decade or more from now – specifically, from 2040”. It says there is a strong argument that a “small, but significant” level of nuclear energy will be needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions completely from the power grid at lowest possible cost after that date.

More specifically, it says one or both of SMRs or fossil fuel power plants using carbon capture and storage (CCS), neither of which yet exist at a commercial scale, will be needed to achieve electricity grid decarbonisation levels greater than 90% at lowest possible cost.
It says its modelling found cutting emissions from the electricity grid by more than 98% without nuclear or CCS could result in an “extreme increase” in costs to consumers of up to $20.2bn a year.
Some energy analysts familiar with the report criticised the modelling, saying it excluded existing technology that could help provide the final 2% of energy in 2050, including demand response and hydrogen. They said it was also likely new technologies would develop in the next 25 years to help fully decarbonise the grid.
Simon Holmes à Court, convener of political fundraising body Climate 200 and a longtime clean energy commentator and advocate, said the Blueprint report reinforced the point that SMRs “will not and cannot play a meaningful role in our grid this decade or next”.
“With coal leaving the grid before then the focus must be on managing the transition to a low cost and reliable renewables and storage backed grid,” he said.
“By the middle of the century we may well have many more technologies to choose from, maybe even nuclear. But in this case the modelling has some weird assumptions leading to bizarre conclusions.”
Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, said the report’s findings had “no great policy weight” because it was impossible to accurately predict the cost of cutting emissions from the grid in the long-term given technological change was happening so rapidly.

He said this applied not only to the Blueprint Institute’s work, but also to modelling used by the Australian Energy Market Operator in its integrated system plan. Aemo found the optimal future grid would run nearly entirely on renewable energy, with a range of technologies – including batteries, pumped hydro, demand response and fast-start gas plants – filling gaps around it.
Mountain, who backs a rapid roll out of renewable energy as making economic sense, said: “This report makes the same error that it fairly accuses Aemo of making – it assumes the future but dresses it up as an objective prediction. Electricity technology is changing incredibly quickly. Experts’ predictions for beyond 10 years ahead should be accorded the same weight as those of fortune tellers.”
He said nuclear energy was not well suited to playing a minor role in a grid already overwhelmingly running on renewable energy, and its introduction would be “likely to require the abandonment of a good deal of already existing renewable generation”.
“I wonder what customers will think of that,” Mountain said.
The Blueprint Institute’s report says its modelling should not be read as a precise prediction of the future. But it says it had consistently found a mix of all available low emissions technologies, including those that were controversial, would be needed “to reach deep decarbonisation at the lowest possible total system cost”.
The report says “both sides of the nuclear debate in Australian politics are wrong”.
“The left is blinded by its ideological opposition to nuclear power to the point that it has been unable to have a rational debate about its potential merits decades from now. Similarly, the right desperately wants to use the imagined prospect of an immediate and sensational breakthrough in nuclear power to halt the ongoing build out of renewables that is expensive, but ultimately necessary,” it says.
“Nuclear power is not a miraculous solution to our energy needs, but neither is it a technology we can afford to dismiss out of hand.”
The Blueprint Institute declined to comment beyond what was in the report.

Labor to speed up new anti-racism strategy amid voice and Israel-Hamas war tensions,2023-10-19,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/20/labor-to-speed-up-new-anti-racism-strategy-amid-voice-and-israel-hamas-war-tensions,"Exclusive: Multicultural affairs minister Andrew Giles ‘very concerned’ about social cohesion in Australia ‘given the events of recent weeks’
The Albanese government will expedite a new national racism strategy amid rising community tensions triggered by the war between Israel and Hamas, and the defeat of the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum last Saturday.
The minister for multicultural affairs, Andrew Giles, told Guardian Australia’s politics podcast there is a “renewed sense of urgency” about launching the new anti-racism campaign “given the events of recent weeks”.
Asked how concerned he was about social cohesion in Australia in the wake of the polarising referendum campaign and domestic anxieties about the Middle East conflict, Giles replied: “I’m very concerned.”
The government has been working with the Australian Human Rights Commission to set the foundations of an anti-racism strategy. Giles said “some research has gone into how we best go about it and how we best engage Australians who, in the context of busy lives, may not have the bandwidth to think through some of these issues in detail”.
“I think that is a big lesson of recent politics around the world – that we have got to understand how all the pressures and dimensions of an individual’s life impact on their willingness or capacity to engage in issues … we’ve got to be where people are, not where we want them to be.”
Giles said in order to be persuasive, the government had to consider how best to connect people with “experiences that may not be part of their lives”.
“I think we’ve got to combine the fact that there are heightened reasons to advance an anti-racism agenda, but we’ve also got to make sure … that the strategy speaks to those it needs to speak to.”

He said he was engaging with both the Jewish and Palestinian communities to take on board “the ideas and sentiments that exist there”. He said there were “hundreds of thousands of Australians who have a direct, immediate, personal connection to this awful conflict”.
“So for me, as the minister for multicultural affairs, my focus, my absolute priority, is on ensuring that we do everything we can to keep Australians together, to make sure that we never take for granted our hard-won social cohesion and support for a multicultural and diverse society,” Giles said.
The head of Asio, Mike Burgess, recently issued a rare public statement saying Australia’s terrorism threat level had not increased as a consequence of the Israel-Hamas war, but his agency was “concerned about the potential for opportunistic violence with little or no warning”.
Against a backdrop of partisan contention in the early stages of the Middle East conflict, that statement also included a plea for community harmony, with Burgess saying that “words matter”. He urged “all parties consider the implications for social cohesion when making public statements”.
Giles said the government listened to the advice of the security agencies. “There have been at least two neo-Nazi incidents on the streets of Melbourne in recent times, and that lends a sense of urgency.” It was “more important than ever to have a society that is anchored in a sense that we all deserve to be valued”.

“We’ve got to recognise that racism, antisemitism and Islamophobia have all been on the increase for some time, and there are forces in our society who seek to exploit these things.
“So building a strategy that’s all about bringing Australians together and recognising the harms that racism does again, not just to individuals, but to our sense of society, is absolutely fundamental right now.”
A scoping study associated with the national strategy said the myth that racism doesn’t exist in Australia “is easily debunked by research and evidence”.
The report noted that 52% of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people reported experiencing at least one form of racial prejudice in 2021, while 34% of people from non-English speaking backgrounds reported experiencing racism based on complexion, ethnic origin or religious belief.
Labor had promised to develop a new anti-racism strategy in opposition. The human rights commission had been aiming to complete a draft framework by early 2024.

Israel defence minister tells troops they will soon see Gaza – as it happened,2023-10-19,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/19/israel-hamas-war-live-news-today-gaza-aid-rafah-crossing-egypt-joe-biden-visit-rishi-sunak-netanyahu-meeting-tel-aviv-latest-updates,"This blog is now closed. You can find the latest Israel-Hamas war news and updates here.
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has told troops gathered at the Gaza border that they will soon see the Palestinian territory “from the inside”, according to his office.
A statement from his office quoted Gallant as saying:
You see Gaza now from a distance, you will soon see it from inside. The command will come.
His remarks suggest a ground invasion could be nearing. Israel’s military have previously said that its forces were deployed across the country, increasing operational readiness for the next stages of the war, “with an emphasis on significant ground operations”.

This blog is closing. We have launched a new blog at the link below, where we will be covering Biden’s speech as it happens:
In his remarks in an hour’s time, Biden will try to sell Americans on the need to spend billions more dollars on Israel and Ukraine, even as the US House of Representatives, without a leader, cannot approve new spending on the two wars, Reuters reports. “Hamas’s terrorist attacks against Israel,” Biden wrote in a social media post listing topics for his White House speech. “The need for humanitarian assistance in Gaza. Russia’s ongoing brutal war against Ukraine.”He added: “We are at a global inflection point that is bigger than party or politics.”His televised remarks, at 8 pm ET on Thursday (0000 GMT on Friday), follow a Middle East trip upended by a hospital blast in the Gaza Strip.
It is only the second prime-time Oval Office address in the Democratic president’s nearly three years in office; in June he cheered the end of a debt ceiling standoff.
It is 2:00 am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here is where things stand:
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has told troops gathered at the Gaza border that they will soon see the Palestinian territory “from the inside”. Gallant urged the forces to “get organised, be ready” for an order to move in, suggesting an Israeli ground invasion could be nearing.
Israel is likely to launch a bloody ground assault on the Gaza Strip in the coming days, the former prime minister Ehud Barak said in an NBC interview. The Israeli military has a “green light” to move into Gaza whenever it’s ready, Israel’s economy minister, Nir Barkat, said in an interview with the US’s ABC network.
Trucks carrying humanitarian aid will enter Gaza from Egypt’s Sinai peninsula in the coming days, according to the White House, after Joe Biden’s whirlwind visit to Israel on Wednesday. Biden said Israel had agreed to allow the opening of the Egypt-Gaza Rafah crossing to deliveries of desperately needed food, water and medical supplies on condition that the humanitarian assistance was not diverted by Hamas for its own use.
The Rafah crossing is not expected to open Friday for a convoy of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, CNN reported, citing multiple sources. “I would not put money on those trucks going through tomorrow,” one source told the news outlet. US officials now expect the first convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian aid will cross into Gaza from Egypt this weekend, possibly Saturday, the report says. Egyptian state media earlier reported that the Rafah crossing with Egypt would be opened on Friday to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. It comes after Israel, the White House and Egypt confirmed that limited aid will be allowed to travel into Gaza through the crossing. The source told CNN that the situation is “really volatile” and that there are a lot of other details to make sure the aid is sustained, not a one off.
The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has said Gaza “needs aid at scale and on a sustained basis”.
Lack of access to water is one of the biggest challenges in Gaza, according to the international charity Action Against Hunger, which is warning of “a health crisis on the brink of explosion”. The UN estimates that there are fewer than 3 litres of water per person each day for the 2.3 million people living in Gaza, half of whom are children who are most at risk from water shortages and diarrhoeal infections.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said its trucks were “loaded and ready to go” as soon as the Rafah crossing was opened – “hopefully tomorrow”. The WHO director, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the agency was “gravely concerned about the health and wellbeing of civilians in Gaza, who are suffering from bombardment and siege” and about the attacks on healthcare in both Gaza and Israel.
Eight Palestinians were killed in an ongoing Israeli military operation in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarm, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Israel’s police said an officer was also killed during clashes.
At least 21 journalists have been killed since the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel war, the majority in Israel’s attacks on Gaza, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The CPJ reported that, as of this Thursday, 17 Palestinian, three Israeli, and one Lebanese journalist had died since Hamas militants attacked Israel on 7 October, followed by the ongoing bombardments of Gaza by Israel.
Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and Jordan’s King Abdullah II have condemned the “collective punishment” of Palestinians in Gaza as they met in Cairo for talks on the Israel-Hamas war. Sisi and King Abdullah also warned of the dangers of a regional spillover.
The US state department has issued a worldwide caution alert advising American citizens overseas “to exercise increased caution”. The US state department cited “increased tensions in various locations around the world, the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against US citizens and interests”.
The US and British embassies in Beirut have advised their citizens to leave Lebanon while flights “remain available” as border tensions between Israel and Hezbollah intensify over the Israel-Hamas war. Both countries had already warned citizens against travel to Lebanon.
Israel is counting on the UK’s “continuous support” in what will be a “long war” with Hamas, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has told Rishi Sunak, as the two leaders met in Tel Aviv. Sunak flew to Saudi Arabia later on Thursday in efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and prevent a wider regional conflict.
Sunak and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman “agreed to coordinate action” to avoid any further escalation in the region, Downing Street said after a meeting. The UK prime minister “encouraged” Saudi Arabia to use its influence to “support stability” in the region, a No 10 spokesperson said.
At least nine British nationals are confirmed to have died and a further seven are missing after the attack by Hamas on Israel on 7 October, a Downing Street spokesperson has said.
The US state department said 32 Americans have been killed in Israel. Eleven US citizens remain unaccounted for, Matthew Miller, a spokesperson for the state department, said at a news conference on Thursday. The Philippines embassy in Tel Aviv has confirmed the death of another Filipino national, bringing the country’s death toll to four.
The US president, Joe Biden, will address the nation later today to discuss the US’s response to the Israeli-Gaza conflict and the war in Ukraine, less than 24 hours after returning from Tel Aviv to offer Israelis support and aid for Palestinians in a trip upended by a hospital blast in Gaza.
A second plane of humanitarian aid from the EU was due to land in Egypt on Thursday afternoon to help people in Gaza, a spokesperson for the European Commission said. Together with a flight yesterday, it will amount to 54 tonnes of humanitarian aid including hygiene and sanitation products, food, water and shelter.
More than 60 international charities – including Action Aid UK, Bond, Cafod, Christian Aid, Islamic Relief, Médecins Sans Frontières UK, Oxfam GB and Save the Children UK – have signed a statement calling on the UK government to step up its efforts to secure an urgent ceasefire in Israel and Gaza.
The US intelligence community assesses that there likely were between 100 and 300 people killed in the blast at al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, according to unclassified intelligence. The US National Security Council said on Wednesday that the US government assessed that Israel “was not responsible” for the Gaza hospital blast.
The Israeli government has accused the BBC of perpetuating a “modern blood libel” in its reporting of the catastrophic explosion at al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza.
This is Helen Sullivan taking over our live coverage. I’ll be with you throughout the night.
The Lebanese civilian killed on the border with Israel on Thursday was a member of the media, the Lebanese army said in a statement.
The statement reads:
A journalist team of seven people covering news... near the Israeli enemy’s al-Abad site outside the town of Hula, was targeted with machine guns by enemy members, killing one and injuring another.
Earlier, the UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon (Unifil) said one person had been killed after civilians were caught in cross-border fire in Lebanon’s south.
Germany is stepping up its support for Palestinian civilians in Gaza with emergency humanitarian aid amounting to €50m (£43.6m), foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said.
The aid will support international organisations such as the World Food Programme, the UN’s children agency (Unicef) and the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa), Baerbock told journalists in Amman on Thursday.
Baerbock, during a joint press conference with her Jordanian counterpart, Ayman Safadi, said:
This crisis situation, which was acutely triggered by the terrible terrorist attacks by Hamas, also means a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.
Here’s more on the reports that the Rafah crossing may not open tomorrow for humanitarian aid to get to the Gaza Strip, despite earlier reports that Egypt was preparing to open its side of the crossing on Friday morning.
Amichai Stein of Kann News writes:
""It's not certain that humanitarian aid will enter Gaza tomorrow"", People with knowledge of the talks tell me.""There is a lot of talk. Trying to short out the details. And what will enter. And how we can convey the message that it won't be just 20 trucks - but a ongoing issue""
The Rafah crossing is not expected to open Friday for a convoy of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, CNN reported, citing multiple sources.
“I would not put money on those trucks going through tomorrow,” one source told the news outlet.
Egyptian state media earlier reported that the Rafah crossing with Egypt would be opened tomorrow to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. It comes after Israel, the White House and Egypt confirmed that limited aid will be allowed to travel into Gaza through the crossing.
The source told CNN that the situation is “really volatile” and that there are a lot of other details to make sure the aid is sustained, not a one off. They said:
These people have been waiting for food, for medicine and for water. If they’re told 20 trucks are coming in and we don’t know when is next it’s going to create a really dangerous situation. If I were in that situation, if I didn’t think there would be more trucks, I’d do everything I could to get what’s inside.
US officials now expect the first convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian aid will cross into Gaza from Egypt this weekend, possibly Saturday, the report says.
Israel security officials have signalled their readiness to embark on a ground offensive into Gaza that they say will be far more comprehensive and ferocious than any previous conflict with Hamas.
Following a Hamas attack on 7 October that killed at least 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, Israel has called up 360,000 reservists, and amassed a huge army around Gaza’s narrow coastal strip, while reinforcing defences on the northern border against the possibility of an attack from Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Joe Biden left Israel after a day of talks on Wednesday, saying that US and Israeli officials had discussed “alternatives” to a mass ground offensive into Gaza, which will almost certainly cause large-scale civilian casualties. More than 3,000 Palestinians have already died in the enclave from the past 12 days of aerial bombardment.
Israeli officials however are adamant that they have no choice but launch a massive assault, codenamed Operation Swords of Iron. Over the past 16 years since the militant movement seized power in Gaza, they argue, Israel has fought three significant conflicts with Hamas, but they said those campaigns were aimed at keeping Hamas in check rather than destroying it.
“The strategy was to have a longer gap every time between the different conflicts, but it failed and it cannot happen any more,” a senior Israeli security official said.
So the only conclusion is that we have to go in, we have to go in and clean it and to eliminate Hamas from the roots, not only militarily, but also economically, its administration. Everything should go away.
“That’s the idea now and we are getting prepared for that,” the official said, and warned:
It won’t be clear cut and it won’t be as short as we would like as Israelis. It will be a prolonged campaign. It will take time.
A Lebanese civilian was killed on Thursday near the border with Israel and seven people were rescued after being stranded during an exchange of fire.
The UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon (Unifil) said Lebanese forces requested assistance to bring back seven people stranded along the border with Israel during a “significant” exchange of fire.
It said it had urged the Israeli military to suspend fire to facilitate the rescue operation, and Israel complied, allowing Lebanese troops to recover the seven.
Tragically, one person lost his life during this incident and the others were successfully rescued.
This evening, the Lebanese Armed Forces requested UNIFIL's assistance for seven individuals stranded near the Blue Line, close to Sheikh Abad's tomb, during a significant exchange of fire across the Blue Line.
UNIFIL contacted the IDF, urging them to cease fire in order to facilitate the rescue operation.The IDF suspended fire, allowing the LAF to extract the individuals from the area.Tragically, one person lost his life during this incident and the others were successfully rescued.
A Lebanese security source said the Lebanese civilian was killed by Israeli fire and another person was wounded, Reuters reported.
The incident was around Hula, which lies in an area across the border from the village of Manara, the source said.
Hezbollah said it fired rockets at an Israeli position in Manara and that Israel responded with shelling. Israeli jets struck three people in Lebanon who attempted to launch anti-tank missiles toward Israel, the military said in a later statement.
The head of the Israel Defense Forces’ southern command said Israeli forces are finalizing their preparations before a ground invasion of Gaza.
Maj Gen Yaron Finkelman, speaking to troops near the Gaza border, said the expected ground offensive in the Gaza Strip will be “long and intense”, the Times of Israel reported.
“We are going to beat them in their territory,” he said.
It’s going to be difficult, long and intense.
The US president, Joe Biden, is set to deliver a primetime address tonight at 8pm eastern time (0000 GMT on Friday) in which he will discuss the US response to the wars between Israel and Hamas, as well as Ukraine and Russia.
Biden’s remarks follow a brief visit to Tel Aviv in which he met with the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
During the visit, Biden pledged support for Israel in its fight against Hamas but cautioned Israel to not be “consumed by rage”. He also urged Israel to “not repeat” the same mistakes the US made after 9/11.
Biden’s speech comes as the House of Representatives remain in a weeks-long limbo as Republicans struggle to decide on a speaker.
With the House essentially shut down and unable to pass legislation, Biden is expected to face hurdles in his likely additional requests for funds for both wars.
We will be following Biden’s speech live on the blog, so stay tuned.
A US state department official working on global arms transfers has resigned, citing his opposition to the Biden administration’s decision to continue military assistance to Israel.
In a letter posted on LinkedIn, Josh Paul said that when he had joined the bureau of political-military affairs more than 11 years ago, he had made a promise to himself that he would stay “as long as I felt the harm I might do could be outweighed by the good I could do”. He wrote:
I am leaving today because I believe that in our current course with regards to the continued – indeed, expanded and expedited – provision of lethal arms to Israel – I have reached the end of that bargain.
He described the attack by Hamas on Israel on 7 October as “not just a monstrosity; it was a monstrosity of monstrosities”.
But I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response, and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people – and is not in the long-term American interest.
Paul said that he could not work to support a set of policy decisions that include “rushing more arms to one side of the conflict”, which he believes to be “shortsighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse”.

NSW to review treaty consultation plan after voice referendum defeat,2023-10-19,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/19/nsw-to-review-treaty-consultation-plan-after-voice-referendum-defeat,"Exclusive: With Indigenous leaders ‘shell-shocked’, sources say there are a ‘lot of conversations’ in the Minns government about next step
The New South Wales government will review part of its state treaty consultation plan, a key election promise, in the wake of the crushing federal referendum defeat on the voice to parliament.
The government isn’t confirming the appointment of three commissioners to oversee the process as planned – and previously outlined by the Aboriginal affairs and treaty minister, David Harris, in April. Sources say the consultation process and timeline will now be reviewed.
The government was unsure how to handle the situation given voters had roundly rejected the federal Indigenous voice, according to sources, however the premier, Chris Minns, insisted consultation would go ahead.
A senior Labor figure said there would be “strategic adjustments” in the wake of the “significant result” on the weekend.
“It would not be wise to lock in a strategy four days after a referendum,” they said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The government is going to respect that First Nations leadership in NSW is pretty shellshocked.”
Hope of a treaty with First Nations people in Queensland now appears doomed, with the opposition pledging to repeal existing legislation and the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, saying it needs bipartisan support to proceed.
In NSW, some Labor MPs said the hesitation in pushing ahead with their plan was less about concerns stemming from negative voter sentiment in Labor heartlands, and more about assessing the appetite for another process among a community in mourning.
“There are a lot of conversations going on behind the scenes about what comes next,” a Labor source said. Another said: “No one has a clue.”
Harris in April quietly announced he planned to appoint three commissioners, alongside a secretariat, to oversee a year-long treaty consultation with the First Nations community.
“They’ll bring a report back to the parliament and then we will then work to set up a process that conforms to the views that we see,” the minister told the National Indigenous Times six months ago.
“The important thing is, in this term of government there’s something that’s legislated so that the government’s moving forward [and] will be able to work within an agreed parameter.”
Since then, the government has refused to comment on what specifically the process would look like or when it would begin, other than sometime in this term of parliament and after the referendum, no matter its result.
Asked about the plan on Thursday, Harris would not confirm if or when commissioners would be appointed. He said while the government had advocated a yes vote in the referendum it would also “respect and accept” the state’s 60% no vote.
“The NSW government took to the March election a commitment to starting a consultation process with Aboriginal peoples about treaty,” he said.
“That consultation process remains our commitment. We don’t have anything new to say about that today. We will have more to say over the weeks ahead.”
In an interview with the Guardian in September, Minns said he was open to implementing a state voice to parliament or one of the other models being implemented as part of processes already under way elsewhere in Australia.
He said it would be up to Aboriginal communities and the government would gauge that through the $5m consultation.
Since Saturday’s result, he has repeatedly highlighted the challenges ahead for NSW in achieving a treaty.
“Our position is we’re going to engage with First Nations people,” he said on Thursday.
“We’ve got a mandate in place to begin the process of the treaty. I’m not going to lie, it’s going to be a very difficult process. It’s been ongoing for many years in other states and jurisdictions around the country.”
He said the state could develop a process in this term of parliament without waiting for an election to gauge support, but also that the government would be “responsible and anything we bring in we’ll bring to the people of NSW”.
The NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, said he would not support a state voice but respected the government’s “mandate to consult” on treaty.
“The opposition’s focus is instead on the practical and urgent delivery of policies and programs in Closing the Gap partnerships that overcome Indigenous disadvantage,” Speakman said.

Defence whistleblower David McBride makes last-ditch request to attorney general to end prosecution,2023-10-19,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/20/defence-whistleblower-david-mcbride-makes-last-ditch-request-to-attorney-general-to-end-prosecution,"Former military lawyer’s legal team warns public has made its ‘disapproval of the continued prosecution abundantly clear’
David McBride’s legal team has made a last-ditch request to the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, to intervene and end his prosecution, warning the public had made their “disapproval of the continued prosecution abundantly clear”.
McBride, a former military lawyer, is facing trial in the ACT courts next month for his alleged leaking of documents to the ABC, which were used to produce a series of articles exposing alleged war crimes by Australian troops.
Civil society and transparency groups, including the Human Rights Law Centre, have repeatedly called on the attorney general to use extraordinary powers to intervene and end the prosecution.
Dreyfus has so far declined, saying such powers are “reserved for very unusual and exceptional circumstances”, noting that the decision to prosecute is made independently by the commonwealth director of public prosecutions, and pointing to his government’s broader actions to improve whistleblower protections.
McBride’s lawyers, Xenophon Davis, wrote to Dreyfus last week in a last attempt to convince him otherwise. They argued that the prosecution “is not in the public interest to continue” and said circumstances had changed since it last approached the CDPP asking it to drop the case.
Their letter, seen by Guardian Australia, argued that public sentiment now significantly favours dropping his prosecution.

“Members of the public have made their disapproval of the continued prosecution abundantly clear,” he said. “Petitions calling for the charges to be dropped have been widely supported, including a recent GetUp petition with over 40,000 signatures.
“Various open letters and statements by lawyers, journalists and politicians calling on you to discontinue proceedings have also been circulated publicly.”
McBride’s lawyers also referred to an open letter last month, which was signed by numerous high-profile human rights organisations and religious organisations, as well as former judges, lawyers and barristers.
That letter, published in the Nine newspapers, called for an end to prosecutions of whistleblowers and spoke of the crucial role that whistleblowers and journalists play in exposing injustice.

“We urge you to hear these calls from the Australian public and discontinue the proceedings,” McBride’s lawyers wrote.
His lawyers also argued that there was no requirement that a case be “exceptional” or “unusual” for an attorney general to intervene.
“To the extent that any such requirement exists, we say that exceptional circumstances are clearly made out in relation to Mr McBride.”
McBride, earlier in the proceedings, withdraw a bid to use the Public Interest Disclosure Act to protect himself from prosecution. He did so after the commonwealth made a public interest immunity to keep some evidence from the court, which McBride said would have made his PID Act application impossible.
The attorney general was approached for comment.

LNP’s cold political calculation dares Annastacia Palaszczuk to make treaty an election issue,2023-10-19,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/20/lnps-cold-political-calculation-dares-annastacia-palaszczuk-to-make-treaty-an-election-issue,"She was iron-willed during Covid, but it’s become harder to know what Queensland’s premier really stands for
In the Queensland parliament in May, Annastacia Palaszczuk spoke bluntly about “uncomfortable truths”.
“Each generation is called to make its mark on its age,” Palaszczuk said. “A treaty with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is ours.
“We have not faltered in our commitment.”
On Thursday, Queensland’s Path to Treaty appeared to reach a dead end. The Liberal National party withdrew bipartisan support, claiming – without a deliberate attempt at irony – that the process “will lead to greater division”.
Then Palaszczuk faltered in her commitment.
Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup
She deflected questions about the treaty by saying it was “a long way off” and would require opposition support.
“We need unity in this state and we need to be talking about the issues that really matter out there amongst Queenslanders. It is cost of living.
“For a treaty process you would need bipartisan support. You’d need to go and ask the leader of the opposition today about why he is not standing by what he said in parliament.”
Palaszczuk, of course, is not to blame for the LNP’s cold political calculation after the failed voice to parliament referendum.
It’s a simple enough tactic. The frontline of next year’s state election contest will be fought in Townsville, Cairns, regional centres and the city fringes where Labor holds a tenuous grip on several seats. Those places voted overwhelmingly against the voice.
Pollsters have cautioned against reading too much into the political implications of the referendum, but the last thing Labor would want ahead of the October 2024 poll is to see the same scare campaigns unleashed.
The opportunism in opposition leader David Crisafulli’s manoeuvre is plain to see. He might as well have dared Palaszczuk to make treaty an election issue.
Crisafulli said on Thursday that the LNP will repeal legislation enabling a path to treaty – which his party voted for in May – if they win government.
“I’m not prepared to do what the prime minister did and just continue strongly without listening,” he said.“Going down the same path for another bruising six months, 12 months, several years, in my mind would not advance anything. It would regress the situation.”
The LNP has consistently lost ground to minor rightwing parties in regional Queensland at recent elections and the treaty backflip might have been executed with half an eye on those contests. The conservative party cannot win an election with a primary vote in the mid-30s and without winning seats in north Queensland.
However, those sorts of calculations always have a flipside in Queensland. The party holds only four seats in greater Brisbane and has previously been seen as subservient to the hard right. The party could lose Clayfield – which voted yes at the referendum – to Labor or the Greens.

The LNP position has backed the government into a corner, some Labor MPs said. The way they see it, Palaszczuk has been left with two options: softly back away from treaty while blaming the LNP for the failure; or progress the work quietly, while trying to keep the issue away from the election.
“It’s probably too early to say which way it will go,” one MP said.
Whatever the decision, the situation exposes a government that appears to be limping towards the next election, consistently unable to control its own agenda.
Palaszczuk’s last election victory was built on her intractability during the Covid pandemic. It seemed no amount of media pressure or political attacks could sway her on border closures and restrictions.
And yet in the time since, Palaszczuk’s government has given pretty clear signals that it is not up for a serious political fight. It has bowed to pressure on youth crime, modest land tax reforms, and housing standards.
When the going gets tough, the premier’s office has one tactic – try to get the issue off the agenda.
The problem is that the neutralisation strategy rarely appears to work. Each concession to a Courier Mail campaign only emboldens the newspaper to come back harder next time. Each policy backflip on youth crime has only amplified the hysteria at the next serious incident.
Pollsters understand there are layers to political strategy. Taking decisions because of the votes you might win, or lose, is just the skin of the onion.
Voting is an emotional decision. Most people walk into polling stations having wrestled with their feelings, rather than weighed policy outcomes or tried to align their values to political parties. One thing they won’t abide is politicians who don’t come across as genuine.
If Palaszczuk is to win next year, she needs voters to believe she is willing to fight for something – anything – in the face of political pressure. And that might mean facing up to some uncomfortable truths.

Teal MPs call for national road-user charges after high court shuts down Victoria’s EV tax,2023-10-19,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/20/teal-mps-call-for-national-road-user-charges-after-high-court-shuts-down-victorias-ev-tax,"‘We need … to maintain our roads in a way that’s fair, and aimed at helping, not hindering, electrification of transport’, says Monique Ryan
Teal independent MPs have welcomed the high court’s decision to strike down Victoria’s electric vehicle tax, urging the federal government to instead legislate national road-user charges.
Zoe Daniel, Allegra Spender, Monique Ryan and Kylea Tink have all called for road use charges to apply fairly to all vehicles, with a nationally consistent scheme that does not target EVs.
On Thursday the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, left the door open to the proposal, indicating that federal Labor wanted to “work with the Victorians and with the other states and territories on policy relating to electric vehicles” to respond to the high court’s decision.
The high court ruled that the imposition of a tax by the Victorian government for each kilometre ​driven was unconstitutional because the states do not have the power to impose such excise taxes on consumption.
Ryan said she welcomed the decision since Victoria’s tax “could have actively disincentivised drivers from transitioning to EVs” which would be a “retrograde step”.
Ryan also said she didn’t support “individual states and territories’ bitsy little taxes that contribute to [the] complexity of our tax system, without a national approach to an important problem”.

“The federal government should lead this,” she said. “We need a national plan that works out how to maintain our roads in a way that’s fair, and aimed at helping, not hindering, electrification of transport.”
Daniel said the decision was “a wake-up call for the Albanese government”.
“Transport minister Catherine King needs to get her skates on and introduce fuel standards designed to encourage the sale of fuel efficient vehicles and EVs and in line with comparable countries,” she said.
“We need the government to initiate an equitable plan for a national road-user charge so that all road users pay their fair share for using our highways.”
Spender said: “While more and more Australians are now shifting to EVs, it’s important we don’t put additional barriers in place that might drive buyers to stay with fossil fuels rather than EVs.
“The court decision makes clear that the federal government must take a leadership role in fixing our failed transport tax system.”
Spender called for “a comprehensive road-user charge that applies fairly to all vehicles” to “to incentivise the shift to EVs, whilst maintaining a strong tax base for the future as fuel excise revenue declines”.
Tink said she would welcome “a sensible conversation about a national road-user charge, including a pricing regime that considers all the negative externalities associated with vehicle use, from carbon emissions to road damage, congestion, and health impacts”.“The Victorian EV tax was not sensible. It targeted electric vehicle drivers at an early stage of adoption [and] was rushed and poorly administered.”
Independent MP Zali Steggall said she did not “see a clear case for EV road-user charging in the immediate future” because “EVs will play an important role in our efforts to decarbonise”.
“To support Australia’s transition to net zero the government needs to encourage EV uptake. Tax incentives, such as a generous sales tax rebates have helped countries like Germany and Norway successfully increase the uptake of EVs.”
The Greens also welcomed the high court decision, but urged the Albanese government to rule out introducing a tax on electric vehicles.
“We should be making electric vehicles cheaper and more affordable, not making them more expensive with an electric vehicles tax,” Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said.
The opposition’s transport spokesperson, Bridget McKenzie, said on Wednesday that Labor had been “very flat footed” on road-user charging.
McKenzie noted that the $13.7bn collected from fuel excise is in decline, driven by the uptake of EVs.
In September, McKenzie told a road user charging conference in Singapore that “every time a high-net worth Australian citizen buys an electric vehicle, they immediately stop paying fuel excise and stop contributing towards that cost of maintaining our roads”.
“As a result, with each passing week, the fuel excise in Australia becomes less and less equitable.
“And the implementation of a road user charge becomes more necessary and more inevitable.”
Chalmers said the federal government was “big supporters of electric vehicles”. “That’s why we’ve got the tax cuts to encourage more people to take up EVs, that’s why we’re also committed to the fuel efficiency standard.”

Charged up: how two EV owners took on Victoria’s electric vehicle tax – and won,2023-10-19,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/20/charged-up-how-two-ev-owners-took-on-victorias-electric-vehicle-tax-and-won,"The state levy was a good example of what not to do to support a transition to EVs, plaintiffs Chris Vanderstock and Kathleen Davies say
Kathleen Davies remembers driving an electric vehicle in 2012, and how it felt as if she was commuting in a spaceship.
“There were hardly any on the road – it felt quite bizarre,” she says.
Her family were in the minority almost a decade ago when they bought their first electric vehicle. Davies had been inspired to lead a more environmentally sustainable life after reading The Weather Makers by Tim Flannery, one of Australia’s leading climate writers.
Another Melbourne driver, Chris Vanderstock, is similarly a proponent of electric vehicles and their environmental benefits, and now owns two.
On Wednesday, after joining forces, Vanderstock and Davies had their fight for greener transport vindicated by the nation’s highest court. They were the two plaintiffs in a landmark high court case that struck down Victoria’s electric vehicle tax.
The pair had argued that the imposition of a tax, charged per kilometre ​driven, was unconstitutional because the states do not have the power to impose such excise taxes on consumption.
Davies, an engineering consultant, bought her family’s first electric vehicle in 2012 for almost $60,000 – “more money than I’d ever spent on any car”.

But when the Victorian government’s tax was introduced in 2021, Davies began a flurry of activism – ringing politicians, signing petitions and writing letters objecting to the levy.
“It was an obstacle to electric vehicle uptake and we need to do all we can to de-carbonise the roads. I felt like I was being punished for trying to do the right thing,” she says.
Davies says reading coverage of the eight Australian teenagers who won a landmark climate litigation case against the then federal environment minister Sussan Ley – which was overturned on appeal – sparked her determination to pursue a legal case against the tax.
“I thought if they can do it, this is another thing I can do,” she recalls.
“It was a leap in the unknown but my husband said ‘just go for it’. He could see I was getting more activated. It was the fear that turned into anger, and that’s what drove me.”
Davies and Vanderstock were represented by Equity Generation Lawyers, which represented the eight teenagers.
Vanderstock, who works as a nurse manager, says he was “ecstatic” to win the high-stakes case.
He says leaving a legacy for his children, by helping reduce emissions on the state’s roads, was a major driver for pursuing the case.

“I wanted them to be proud of something I had done here,” he says.
The court’s decision will likely prevent New South Wales and Western Australia from proceeding with plans to introduce road-user charges from 2027 and could spark constitutional challenges to everything from gaming taxes, to car registration and waste levies.
Vanderstock says he hopes the ruling will pave the way for the Albanese government to implement a national road-user charge that is “fair and equitable”, and help accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.
“The ball is now in the commonwealth’s corner to decide how they’ll address fuel excise shortfall, which has been on the decline for more than 20 years,” he says.
“What Victoria had is a good example of what not to do.”
The federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, on Thursday said the court ruling had consequences for the taxes at both levels of government and said the commonwealth would work through what it meant for electric vehicles.
Victoria’s treasurer, Tim Pallas, on Thursday said the state would consider retrospectively refunding the tax paid by electric vehicle owners.
Vanderstock says it will be “lovely” if the tax is retrospectively refunded, but adds he never pursued the case to recoup money.
“We never did this to avoid paying taxes. We just want a fair and just system,” he says.

Palestinian rights groups in US fight to protect gains as public opinion shifts toward Israel,2023-10-20,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/palestinian-rights-groups-public-opinion,"Support for Palestinian cause had risen earlier this year, but polls show decrease particularly among Democrats since Hamas attacks

Public opinion polls surveying Americans’ views on the Israel-Hamas conflict suggest support for the Palestinian cause has taken a hit as a result of the carnage unfolding in the Middle East.
The recent wave of violence followed a period of significant improvement in US public opinion toward Palestinians, with Gallup polling earlier this year showing for the first time that Democrats expressed more sympathy for the Palestinians (49%) than the Israelis (38%).
Advocates for Palestinian rights say any regression is probably short-lived. “By the time this is over, we’ll be right back where we started and maybe even then some. Israel is committing horrific crimes. Media will catch up. The administration will catch up,” said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute.
In conversations with the Guardian, advocates described difficulty harnessing public sympathy for the Palestinians while the political establishment and media ecosystem, they say, reflexively amplify Israeli perspectives and suppress Palestinian voices. But they also believe that the tone emanating from Washington DC is likely to evolve as the conflict persists, especially with an Israeli ground invasion into the Gaza Strip appearing increasingly imminent.
Israel has killed nearly 4,000 Palestinians in its bombing campaign of the Gaza Strip following Hamas’s killing of more than 1,400 Israelis and the abduction of hundreds of hostages on 7 October. In both cases, the majority of casualties have been civilians.
Many point to an earlier war on Gaza, in 2014, as an inflection point for US public opinion, with the shift toward greater sympathy for Palestinians aided by Israel’s rightward march under multiple Netanyahu governments and a succession of other bloody military campaigns in the Palestinian territories that have made the conflict’s asymmetry plain.
Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute, believes that the strident support for Israel’s current war being sounded in the halls of power is at least in part a backlash to those gains.
“The desire to label efforts to advocate for Palestinian liberation and Palestinian human rights as outside the pale of what is acceptable discourse is happening now because Americans increasingly have learned there is a flawed US approach to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and that people cannot be expected to live under occupation as long as they have,” said Berry.
But polling conducted since Hamas’s attack has shown that Americans are largely supportive of Israel’s actions, with 70% saying, according to a recent CNN poll, that its military response was fully or partially justified. That number dropped steadily with age: while 81% of those 65 years and older saw the response as fully justified, only 27% of 18- to 34-year-olds said the same.
An Economist/YouGov poll taken earlier this week found 48% of people said their sympathies lay more with the Israelis: 62% of people over 65 and 35% of people aged 18-29.
The same poll shows American sympathies have shifted significantly toward Israel since its last major conflagration with Hamas in 2021. The biggest swing is among Democrats, whose sympathy with Israel over the Palestinians increased by 18 points, versus Republicans, whose sympathy increased by 12 points.
Huwaida Arraf, a lawyer and longtime Palestinian rights advocate who previously ran for the Democratic nomination to represent Michigan in Congress, says she is particularly disappointed by the public positions taken by the party, and has heard from many fellow Arab Americans that they won’t be voting for it again.
“This party is showing us that there’s no room for us in everything they talk about – human rights, equality, standing up for each other, the dignity of the other. It’s all rhetoric,” Arraf said.
Berry said her organization was fighting on an overwhelming number of fronts against Israel’s war. Those fights include supporting congressional efforts for a ceasefire, lobbying the Department of Education to protect the free speech rights of university students and pushing back against flawed media coverage. The magazine Jewish Currents reported this week that major networks have canceled scheduled appearances by Palestinian figures or suppressed segments after they were recorded.
Berry’s is an uphill battle at a time when the political establishment is in lockstep behind Israel and taking active steps to tamp down dissent, or even talk of restraint, within its own ranks.
Last week, a state department memo first reported by the Huffington Post cautioned staff against using the terms “de-escalation/ceasefire”, “end to violence/bloodshed” and “restoring calm”. A tweet by the secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, promoting a ceasefire was later deleted.
On Wednesday, a state department official resigned over what he said was the Biden administration’s “intellectual bankruptcy” when it comes to the US’s military support for Israel.
Statements responding to the Hamas attacks made by members of the “squad” of progressive House representatives – which mourned the Israeli victims but referenced the occupation, concern for Gazans and opposition to US military aid to Israel – were condemned by Democratic colleagues and the White House as “repugnant”.
“There’s very little right now happening on the Hill that relates to any intellectually honest or constructive discourse,” said Berry.
Despite the emergent consensus stigmatizing calls for de-escalation, a group of 13 progressive members of the House of Representatives introduced a ceasefire resolution earlier this week.
Lara Friedman, the president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, isn’t so sure this picture amounts to a backsliding in support for the Palestinian cause.
“In the heat of this crisis, where the dominant media narrative is deeply empathetic to and largely reflective of Israeli grief and anger,” she said, “the fact that you still have a large percentage of American voters, Democrats and Republicans, that are showing they believe we need to be sympathetic to Palestinians is actually pretty extraordinary.”
But Yousef Munayyer, head of the Palestine-Israel program at the Arab Center Washington DC, is no longer sure public opinion makes much of a difference.
“There’s a huge gap between public opinion and actual power and the structural realities on the ground,” Munayyer said. “There was a degree of naivety in thinking that one of those things really could impact the other in a way that was as urgent and necessary as the situation on the ground called for.”

"Queensland treaty is going ahead, assures interim body charged with implementing it",2023-10-20,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/20/queensland-treaty-is-going-ahead-assures-interim-body-charged-with-implementing-it,"Co-chair of truth and treaty group, Aaron Fa’Aoso, says he remains confident after meeting government representatives on Friday
The co-chair of Queensland’s interim truth and treaty body, Aaron Fa’Aoso, says the state government has given assurances that its treaty process will proceed, after the opposition Liberal National party withdrew its support.
Fa’Aoso, a descendant of the Saibai region in the Torres Strait, said board members of the truth and treaty body met government representatives on Friday.
“They’ve given us an assurance that everything that’s been stated in the (enabling) act will go forward. That gives us confidence,” he said.
The state’s “path to treaty” process has been under way for several years and was formalised in May by the passage of legislation through parliament. The process had bipartisan support.
This week, after the failed voice referendum, the Liberal National party announced it had withdrawn its backing and would repeal the legislation if elected next year.
The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, then appeared to backtrack, saying treaty would require bipartisan support.
Fa’Aoso said the LNP’s decision to withdraw support was disappointing, given the treaty process had been under way since 2019 and had been designed by the government and First Nations people.

“For now it’s about pushing ahead as things stand,” he said.
“The truth telling process is about informing … people of the impacts of colonisation that have been sustained by First Nations communities and peoples across Queensland.
“That piece of work is critical to informing the wider public … why it is essential … this treaty goes ahead.
“A treaty can’t be formed without both sides agreeing to it.
“So there will be a need for bipartisan support moving forward to treaty making.”

Asked about the voice referendum result and speculation the treaty process might need to be altered in order to achieve broad support, Fa’Aoso said the voice and treaty were “two different mechanisms”.
“It’s not apples and apples. They’re two different processes and one can’t be compared to the other.
“[Treaty] has been a carefully consultative and transparent process … since 2019.
“It’s totally different to what the voice was offering and at the end of the day, we feel that this is a solution and a way forward, reframing the relationship.”
Fa’Aoso said the government had confirmed it would release expressions of interest soon, as planned, for two key bodies – a treaty council, and a board of inquiry to conduct a truth telling and healing process.

High court to rule on Catholic church’s liability for abuse committed by paedophile priests ,2023-10-20,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/high-court-to-rule-on-catholic-churchs-liability-for-abuse-committed-by-paedophile-priests,"Church has been granted special leave to appeal Victorian judgment that found Ballarat diocese was vicariously liable for abuse of child
The Catholic church has won the right to challenge in the high court a landmark Victorian ruling forcing the church to take on greater liability for the actions of paedophile priests within its ranks.
In the past two years, the Victorian courts have delivered and upheld an unprecedented ruling that the Ballarat diocese was vicariously liable for the abuse of a five-year-old child known as DP at the hands of assistant priest Father Bryan Coffey.
Vicarious liability is typically used to hold employers responsible for the wrongful or negligent actions of their employees during the course of their employment – even where there is no fault on the part of the employer.
The church, however, has long argued that priests like Coffey were not formal employees, allowing it to dodge claims of vicarious liability.
Earlier this year, Victoria’s highest court rejected that argument and ruled the church was vicariously liable for Coffey’s actions because he was a “servant of the diocese” whose role gave him the “power and intimacy” to access and abuse children.
The diocese, the Victorian court of appeal said, was “all-powerful in the management of clergy within a diocese” and that activities of an assistant parish priest were under the “direct control” of the priest, who reported to the bishop.
“In a real and relevant sense, Coffey was the servant of the diocese, notwithstanding that he was not, in a strict legal sense, an employee of it,” the court ruled.
The decision was expected to pave the way for countless survivors to seek greater compensation from the church.
But the diocese on Friday was granted special leave to appeal the lower ruling in the high court.
In a brief hearing, DP’s counsel David Campbell SC argued against allowing the appeal. He said the decisions of the Victorian courts were “manifestly correct”, meaning it was not an appropriate test case for the high court to consider.
“The relationship in question here is an ancient one, which has its origins in canon law, and is classically … a master-servant relationship,” Campbell said.
“Many of the indicia of that relationship are analogous to an employment one, save that there was no contract of employment. It is our submission that because of those circumstances, while there is lurking an important area of law for consideration, that this is not an appropriate vehicle for that to occur.”
The high court allowed the appeal without hearing further from the church’s lawyers on Friday. It will be set down for a one-day hearing at a later date.

DP, represented by Ken Cush and Associates, was abused by Coffey at his parent’s home in Port Fairy during pastoral visits in 1971, the court of appeal said.
It ruled that Coffey was only able to access and abuse DP because of his role in the church, which gave him a position of power and intimacy.
“It is quite clear that the role of Coffey, presenting as a priest to the local parishioners, invested him with a substantial degree of power, authority and respect,” the court ruled.
“As such, that role, in itself, engendered a significant degree of respect and trust in him by his parishioners, was well justified in concluding that the position of power and intimacy, invested in Coffey as an assistant priest of the parish, provided him not only with the opportunity to sexually abuse the respondent, but also the occasion for the commission of those wrongful acts.”
In 2022, the Victorian supreme court described parts of the church’s argument – namely, that it was not responsible because the abuse took place during after-hours “social” visits – as “ruthless” and “an affront to common sense”.

"Indigenous boy, 16, dies a week after being found unresponsive in WA’s Casuarina prison",2023-10-20,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/20/indigenous-boy-16-dies-perth-casuarina-prison-after-being-found-unresponsive,"Cleveland Dodd died at Perth’s Sir Charles Gairdner hospital shortly after 10pm on Thursday
An Aboriginal teenager has died in a Perth hospital a week after being found unresponsive inside a maximum security prison that is holding more than a dozen young detainees.
Last Thursday Cleveland Dodd, 16, was found unresponsive in his cell at a youth detention unit within the Casuarina prison by staff in the early hours of the morning.
Guardian Australia understands that the incident was suspected to have been an act of self-harm and staff had rendered emergency first aid until paramedics arrived and the teenager was taken to hospital.
In a statement, the Western Australian Department of Justice said Dodd died at the Sir Charles Gairdner hospital shortly after 10pm on Thursday, surrounded by family.
“The Department of Justice wishes to express deepest sympathies to the boy’s family, friends and community for their tragic loss,” it said.
The government has faced harsh criticism over conditions in the state’s only youth detention centre – Banksia Hill – amid ongoing reports of self-harm, suicide attempts and the destruction of cells.

In July last year, 17 children were transferred to a special wing of the maximum security Casuarina men’s prison.
In its statement, the Department of Justice said it helped Dodd’s family, who are from regional WA, to provide comfort during the last weeks of his life and it would continue to provide support after his death.
“The department has aided family from regional WA to spend time with their loved one at the hospital,” it said.
The department said it was continuing to investigate the circumstances leading up to the boy’s death and that there would be a mandatory inquest.
Detainees and staff at Casuarina prison’s Unit 18 and the Banksia Hill detention centre would be provided counselling and support services during this difficult time.
The federal minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, said Dodd’s death was a “terrible tragedy”.
“My heart goes out to the family and friends of the young boy. We can and we must do better by our young people.”
She said it was her understanding that the WA Corruption and Crime Commission is investigating his death.
The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, also offered his condolences to the family.
It comes as the state government faces a class action over its alleged mistreatment of young detainees, with lawyers and advocates repeatedly raising concerns over prolonged lockdowns, solitary confinement and children in distress self-harming and attempting suicide.
In July, the state’s supreme court ruled that the government repeatedly broke the law by holding three young detainees for prolonged lockdowns at the Banksia Hill detention centre and Unit 18.
The state government has been contacted for response.
Dodd’s family later released a statement through its lawyers, saying they wanted answers and immediate action from the government.
“Our family is overwhelmed with grief as we come to terms with the unthinkable – the loss of our most beloved boy, who did not belong in that horrible place known as Unit 18,” the family said.
“Our boy should have had been at home with his family who he loved and who loved him dearly. Our boy deserved a future.”
The family, who gave permission for Dodd to be named and his photograph to be used, said it did not believe a coronial inquest would achieve an outcome.
“A coronial inquest into his death will take far too long to bring meaningful change, policy and law reform,” they said.
“We, his family and community, will not wait patiently in the wings, while legal processes run their course. We will not rest until justice for our boy, and for all other First Nation’s children, is secured.”

First Nations groups reject Peter Dutton’s call for royal commission into child abuse,2023-10-20,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/20/first-nations-groups-reject-peter-dutton-royal-commission-child-abuse,"More than 100 community Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations say safety of Indigenous children ‘should not be politicised’
More than a hundred First Nations advocacy groups and organisations have banded together to oppose Peter Dutton’s calls for a royal commission into the abuse of Indigenous children, accusing the opposition of “political point-scoring” and “demonising” communities.
The opposition leader and his shadow Indigenous Australians minister, the senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, have repeatedly pushed for a royal commission into alleged child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities.
A joint statement backed by more than 100 community Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisationscalls for the safety of children to “not be politicised or used as a platform to advance a political position”.
There have already been 33 reports into child protection since the Bringing Them Home report in 1997, the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (Snaicc) said.
Chair Muriel Bamblett accused the opposition of spreading “fear, distrust and divisiveness”.
“Those who don’t pause to entertain the truth will always spin a story of fear, distrust and divisiveness for their own interests,” Bamblett said.
Bamblett said the calls risked perpetuating harmful prejudice about First Nations communities.

“We are demonising Aboriginal men and reinforcing false stereotypes just to get media attention,” Bamblett said. “We know nationally that most violence and abuse towards Aboriginal people is by non-Aboriginal people.”
Dutton is also facing presure from within his party after his calls for a royal commission.
Bridget Archer blasted Peter Dutton for appearing to “weaponise” child sexual abuse for “some perceived political advantage” after the Liberal backbencher crossed the floor in parliament this week to vote against a motion calling for a royal commission into child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities.
As Indigenous communities attempt to navigate the sadness and hurt felt by the loss and rejection of this referendum, the focus has to be on healing and showing up in support of First Nations leadership, the advocacy group GetUp said.
The GetUp chief executive and Widjabul Wia-bal woman Larissa Baldwin-Roberts said the calls were a “despicable attack” on First Nations families after the voice to parliament referendum was rejected.

“We need the government to show up and listen to what is happening right now in our communities in the wake of this referendum,” Baldwin-Roberts said.
“These are the same tactics and lies that were weaponised against communities that resulted in the NT intervention.”
The Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory (Amsant), which represents the Aboriginal community controlled health services across the Northern Territory, said all children had a right to be safe in their homes and communities.
The Amsant CEO, John Patterson, said any abuse of a child was unacceptable: “Any abuse of any child is abhorrent and profoundly offensive to Aboriginal culture, which has at its heart the care and nurture of children.”
Patterson said there were already recommendations from inquiriesthat required urgent action.
“Rather than generate more recommendations from yet more inquiries, we need to ensure we implement existing recommendations from previous inquiries, including from the royal commission into the care and protection of children,” Patterson said.
If there is any evidence of abuse of children in communities or elsewhere, it must be reported to law enforcement, he said.
“We remind politicians that they are subject to the same laws on mandatory reporting of sexual abuse as all members of the community,” he added.
The federal government said calls for another royal commission did not address the underlying cases of violence and abuse.
“We don’t need another royal commission to tell us that concrete action is needed. Our focus is on the immediate issue of keeping children and women safe,” a spokesperson for the federal government said.
“Our focus is on ending violence against women and children in one generation.”
The spokesperson said the most recent federal budget allocated $589.3m to support women and children’s safety, including $262.6m to support First Nations women and children.
The opposition leader has been contacted for further comment.

"Russian, South African and US athletes get rushed Australian citizenships ahead of 2024 Olympics",2023-10-20,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/20/russian-south-african-and-us-athletes-get-rushed-australian-citizenships-ahead-of-2024-olympics,"Exclusive: Government fast-tracked applications of canoeist, wrestler and water polo player backed by AOC
The Australian government has fast-tracked the citizenship of three athletes from South Africa, Russia and the US, in an effort to boost the nation’s chances of winning gold medals at the 2024 Olympics in Paris.
With the support of the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC), South African canoeist Pierre Van der Westhuyzen, Russian wrestler Georgii Okorokov and US water polo player Sam Slobodien, will receive citizenships ahead of the games after having their applications fast-tracked.
The immigration minister, Andrew Giles, used ministerial discretion to intervene and grant citizenship to Van der Westhuyzen, who has only been in Australia since January 2020.
“The applicant is engaged in a sport at an elite level and, if an Australian citizen, may be selected to represent Australia at the Paris 2014 Summer Olympic Games,” Giles wrote in a note to parliament explaining his decision to intervene.
“The applicant’s contribution to the sport may enhance Australia’s international reputation and provide inspiration and motivation to other athletes. I have decided it would be of benefit to Australia for this applicant to be an Australian citizen.”
Van der Westhuyzen was not otherwise eligible to apply for citizenship as he had not been living in Australia for more than four years, as required by law. Giles said he was “of good character” and had already passed a citizenship test.
The processing time for citizenship applications can vary, with about 90% processed within 10 months.

The South African, whose bid for a ministerial intervention was supported by the AOC, is the brother of Jean van der Westhuyzen, who won gold for Australia in the K2 1000m canoe event at the 2020 Summer Olympics.
“It’s a huge privilege for sure,” van der Westhuyzen told Guardian Australia of the minster’s decision.
“I realise how special this is. Not many people are getting their citizenship as quickly as I am and I’m really so glad I have the opportunity to represent Australia.”
A student at Bond university, on the Gold Coast, he arrived in Australia shortly before international borders were closed due to the Covid pandemic. He said the fast-tracking of his application was necessary to ensure he could compete for a spot in the Australian team.
“After everything that’s been done for me and the belief that people have for me, it just makes me want to do really well for Australia. It’s really an honour,” Van der Westhuyzen said.
The AOC is able to support fast-tracked citizenship applications – or lobby for exemptions to be made for those who don’t meet the requirements – under a “special residence provision of the Citizenship Act”

“The capacity of the AOC to provide this type of support is a significant privilege for Australian sport which the AOC exercises judiciously,” a spokesperson for the body said.
“All requests must be for athletes who will be selected on the next Australian Olympic team.”
The AOC also supported the fast-tracked citizenship of Okorokov, who was a European junior champion in wrestling and has lived in Australia since 2017.
“His talent has been identified by Wrestling Australia and he is part of their high performance squad, also assisting in upskilling local Australian wrestlers,” the AOC said in a statement.
“He has represented Australia on a number of occasions and placed 10th at the 2022 world championships.”
Okorokov, who has been contacted for comment, was based in the Siberian city of Yakutsk, just south of the Arctic Circle. Russia does not allow dual citizenship.
The AOC said the government had also fast-tracked the application of 26-year-old Slobodien, who is a former captain of the University of Southern California’s water polo team.
Slobodien, who was also contacted for comment, was born in New Jersey and won the 2018 Australian Waterpolo League championship. His university profile indicates he was a member of the US youth national team before moving to Australia.
Australia equalled its record of 17 gold medals at the Tokyo olympics.

Australia rules out cancelling Chinese company’s lease over Port of Darwin,2023-10-20,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/australia-eyes-breakthrough-on-wine-as-it-moves-to-scrap-tariffs-on-chinese-wind-towers,"Government also presses for removal of imposts on wine ahead of Anthony Albanese’s visit to Beijing next month
Australia is moving to repair ties with China ahead of Anthony Albanese’s trip to Beijing, ruling out cancelling a Chinese company’s lease over the strategically important Port of Darwin.
The move, which is likely to be welcomed by the Chinese government, comes as Australia also prepares to scrap tariffs on imports of Chinese wind towers, potentially defusing one of Beijing’s trade complaints.
The Australian government announced on Friday afternoon that the Landbridge Group would be allowed to continue with its long-term lease over the Port of Darwin. China has long urged Australia to end the uncertainty over the outcome of a review ordered by Albanese shortly after the 2022 election.
Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup
The Australian government has said, however, that it would continue to monitor security arrangements around the Port of Darwin.
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said the review had found that there was “a robust regulatory system in place to manage risks to critical infrastructure, including the Port of Darwin”.
The review also found that “existing monitoring mechanisms are sufficient and will be ongoing” and “it was not necessary to vary or cancel the lease”.
“The government has accepted that advice,” the department’s statement said.
“Australians can have confidence that their safety will not be compromised, while ensuring that Australia remains a competitive destination for foreign investment.”
The review took in advice from a range of departments and security agencies including the Office of National Intelligence and Australia’s national security agency Asio.
The release of the Port of Darwin review follows news that the Australian government has been pressing China to remove punishing imposts on Australian wine similar to the recent breakthrough on barley. China has so far held its ground and wants movement on its own complaints.
Beijing has proposed a package deal in which it would reopen the door to Australian wine while demanding that Australia give ground on its own tariffs on three Chinese products.
These products – including wind towers – are part of a World Trade Organization dispute dating back to 2021, after Australia launched twin challenges against barley and wine tariffs.
While the Australian government has resisted the proposed package deal, seeing the complaints as separate matters, Australia’s Anti-Dumping Commission has now cleared the way for a partial breakthrough.
In a report published quietly on its website this week, the commission said it “proposes to recommend that the measures on wind towers exported to Australia from China expire on 16 April 2024”.
The commission said it was “not satisfied” that scrapping the tariffs would cause “the material injury that the measures are intended to prevent”.
China’s commerce ministry welcomed the proposed move, saying it was “conducive to deepening bilateral cooperation in the clean energy sector”.
The commerce ministry has previously argued extending the tariffs would harm Australia’s chances of meeting its new targets for renewable energy and emission reductions.
The timing of the recommendation is politically helpful, but government sources emphasised on Friday that the Anti-Dumping Commission operated independently and along its own review timeframes. The commission is part of the industry portfolio.

Albanese is expected to visit China in November, after formally accepting the invitation to travel to the country in September. This would coincide with the 50th anniversary of Gough Whitlam’s visit to China as prime minister, which occurred from 31 October to 4 November 1973.
Albanese has been working to “stabilise” the relationship with China, while insisting that the two countries would continue to “disagree where we must”.
The thaw has resulted in some progress, including the release last week of the detained Australian journalist Cheng Lei.
But the Labor government has repeatedly denied making policy concessions to Beijing. It has locked in support for the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan as part of US-led deterrence efforts, a policy that Beijing has repeatedly criticised.
During the election campaign, Albanese and his frontbenchers had also been highly critical of the Port of Darwin lease arrangements.When asked on 26 April 2022 what a Labor government would do about the Port of Darwin, Albanese said it “should never have been sold to the Chinese”. He said that decision was “extraordinary” because it was a strategic port “and it is something that I’ve said we would examine if we were in government”.But the Albanese government is now likely to defend leaving the lease in place on the basis that it is acting in line with fresh advice.
Opposition spokesperson for home affairs James Paterson said Albanese had “squibbed it” after previously calling the lease’s approval a “grave mistake” while Labor was in opposition.
“Despite promising to deal with it, now he can, he’s squibbed it, cynically dropped it on a Friday afternoon after parliament has risen and after his media appearance for the day,” Paterson said on social media.
“Australians deserve much more transparency when it comes to sensitive and important matters of national security. They deserve answers as to why the PM’s previous concern about this issue has now evaporated.”The NT’s then Country Liberal party government granted a 99-year lease over the Port of Darwin to Landbridge Group in 2015.
A spokesperson for Landbridge said the company was “pleased that the federal government’s review has now been completed”.
“The outcomes reaffirm our position that there is no basis for security concerns given the Port is operated as a commercial enterprise in accordance with Australian Law and the Port transaction documents.
“Landbridge is hopeful that the outcome of this review, which is consistent with the findings of the reviews conducted in both 2015 and 2021, will now bring this matter to a close.”
Albanese will first travel to the United States next week in a trip expected to be dominated by implementing Aukus, along with exchanging views on China and the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East and clean energy.

PwC partner at centre of tax advice scandal banned by Asic for eight years,2023-10-20,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/20/pwc-partner-at-centre-of-tax-advice-scandal-banned-by-asic-for-eight-years,"Financial regulator finds Peter John Collins is ‘not a fit and proper person to provide financial services’
Australia’s financial watchdog has issued an eight-year ban to a former PwC partner at the heart of a confidentiality scandal that triggered a reputation crisis at the firm and a costly sell-off.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has been investigating the conduct of Peter John Collins, of Sandringham in Victoria, who has been accused of sharing confidential government information about multinational tax avoidance with colleagues.
Eight years ago, Collins was advising Treasury on the draft laws, which were part of a global push to stop huge companies minimising their tax bills and shifting profits overseas. According to internal PwC emails obtained and published by the Senate, he shared confidential information with the warning “for your eyes only”.
Those emails also confirm the information from Treasury was used to secure work from “brand-defining” US companies in a push known internally as “the North American Project”.
The breach of confidentiality infuriated the federal treasurer, triggered a federal police investigation and a referral to a corruption watchdog from the Greens, prompted accusations the firm engaged in a “calculated” breach of trust and a “deliberate cover-up”, resulted in many partners being exited, and led to its entire government services division being divested for just $1.
In a statement, Asic said Collins would not be able to “provide financial services or [control] an entity that carries on a financial services business for eight years” because it no longer considered him to be “a fit and proper person”.

“ASIC found that Mr Collins disclosed confidential information he obtained in his roles as a tax advisor to the Commonwealth Treasury and the Australian Board of Taxation,” the watchdog said in a statement.
“Accordingly, ASIC found that Mr Collins is not a fit and proper person to provide financial services and that it was in the public interest to prevent him from working in the financial services industry.”
Collins has the right to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of Asic’s decision.
The Asic deputy chair, Sarah Court, told a Senate inquiry on Friday it was still working through a list of 160 names of PwC Australia staff who hold financial services licences to determine any other potential misconduct.
“We are getting the information that we are able to get, we are liaising with PwC, we’re liaising with the Tax Practitioners Board,” Court said. “We’re continuing to do that matching exercise, if you like, to see if any of the authorised representatives that fall within our jurisdiction are connected, in any way, with the conduct … Mr Collins has been found to have engaged [in].”

The Asic chair, Joseph Longo, told the inquiry the regulator had a “limited” jurisdictional hook to look into the cultural and governance issues that surfaced in a report conducted by Ziggy Switkowski.
Despite Asic’s limitations, Longo said the regulator was still “certainly very interested” in being briefed on the extent of PwC’s problems.
The Labor senator Deborah O’Neill, who is part of the Senate inquiry that has helped reveal the depth of the scandal at PwC Australia, said: “Asic’s finding is a condemnation of gross misuse of confidential information and of the behaviour which PwC had not only tolerated, but seemed to actively cultivate.”
A review of PwC Australia’s internal culture by Switkowski, a former Telstra CEO, found partners who made the firm money were known as “untouchables” and “rainmakers” to whom “the rules don’t always apply”.
PwC Australia’s chief executive, Kevin Burrowes, repeatedly apologised to the Senate earlier this month while confirming six international partners were facing investigations for not raising the alarm when they received confidential government information.
“Six of our partners around the world were found to have not asked the questions they should have done in connection with the confidentiality breaches,” Burrowes said. “The firms in which they reside are taking appropriate action against them.”

 Warning: Benjamin Netanyahu is walking right into Hamas’s trap | Jonathan Freedland,2023-10-20,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/20/benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-israel-prime-minister,"​They crave a rage-filled reaction from Israel’s prime minister. Wise heads should temper his response – and then be rid of him
You cannot think straight when you’re in pain. That’s truer still when the pain is combined with fury at those who caused it. There’s a reason we speak of “blind rage”: when anger descends, we cannot see what’s in front of us. And if that’s true of individuals, it’s truer still of nations.
That was the message Joe Biden brought when he travelled to Israel this week. Drawing on his own experience of multiple bereavements, he consoled Israelis grieving for the more than 1,400 civilians killed by Hamas in the 7 October massacre and those waiting for word on the 203 hostages, including young children and the elderly, still held in Gaza. In what has become his signature style, Biden shared in their pain.
But he also drew on his memory of how US leaders reacted to America’s collective trauma in September 2001, and here he offered something closer to a warning. “I caution you, while you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it. After 9/11 we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.”
He did need to spell out that, in its fury at al-Qaida, the US did not simply hunt down that one network, but invaded the country that harboured it, Afghanistan, and one that had nothing to do with it, Iraq – both with devastating, lasting consequences. After 9/11, the US declared a global “war on terror” that cost hundreds of thousands of lives, brought al-Qaida into places where it did not previously exist – Iraq among them – and birthed a new and even darker terror, in the form of Islamic State.
It is a warning from recent history that should be preying on the minds of Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s military commanders, as the hours count down to an expected ground incursion into Gaza. Israel and its advocates stress that the country has the right, indeed the duty, to defend itself against an enemy that proved its cruelty a fortnight ago. But this is to risk America’s post-9/11 error: convinced that a chosen course of action is legitimate, it’s easy to forget to ask if it is wise.
Already, in its rage, Israel has made decisions it may come to regret. Its mission should be clear: to ensure that Hamas is stripped of the capacity ever to repeat what it did two weeks ago. That means Israel’s war should be with Hamas alone, not the people of Gaza. And yet by imposing a near-total blockade on the territory, denying its more than 2 million citizens food, water and medicine, it has inflicted pain on the entire population – pain that will be only partially alleviated under the terms of a concession negotiated by Biden.
Such action falls foul of both morality and international law, but it also runs counter to Israel’s own interests – weakening overseas support at the very moment it should be at its strongest – and to its stated goal. Because if recent years have shown anything, it is that making life more hellish in Gaza does not loosen Hamas’s grip – it tightens it.
Coming after relentless bombing from the air, a full-scale Israeli ground invasion could be an even greater gift to the organisation, handing it exactly what it wants. Indeed, the extravagant sadism of the crimes Hamas committed in the sabbath of blood on 7 October – the rape, torture and mutilation – was surely designed to goad Israelis, to drive them so crazy with grief that they would storm into Gaza, blindly walking into the very trap Hamas had so carefully set for them.
That may be literally the case, with Israeli troops lured into tunnels and back streets that amount to one giant booby trap. On that terrain, Israel will suffer heavy casualties and it will inflict them – and both outcomes will suit Hamas just fine. The latter because they see a rising Palestinian death toll as an asset in the propaganda war; the former because it will validate their claim that it is Hamas alone, not the secular nationalists of rivals Fatah, who represent the true resistance against the Israeli enemy.
A long, bloody war is what Hamas and its Iranian backers – desperate to derail recent moves towards “normalisation” of relations between Israel and several of its neighbours, most crucially Saudi Arabia – yearn for. It will mean that, even if the infrastructure of Hamas is destroyed, the hatred that powers it will not be: on the contrary, it will grow in the hearts of a new, bereaved generation of Palestinians. Not for nothing did the scholar Hussein Ibish write this week: “In trying to fulfil the pledge to ‘eliminate Hamas’, Israel could well deliver everything Hamas is counting on.”
That notion might seem counterintuitive and yet, when it comes to Netanyahu himself, it is unexpectedly on-brand. Prime minister for most of the last 15 years, Netanyahu has been an enabler of Hamas, building up the organisation, letting it rule Gaza unhindered – save for brief, periodic military operations against it – and allowing funds from its Gulf patrons to keep it flush. Netanyahu liked the idea of the Palestinians as a house divided – Fatah in the West Bank, Hamas in Gaza – because it allowed him to insist that there was no Palestinian partner he could do business with. That meant no peace process, no prospect of a Palestinian state, and no demand for Israeli territorial concessions.
None of this was a secret. In March 2019, Netanyahu told his Likud colleagues: “Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas … This is part of our strategy – to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.”
That catastrophic misjudgment alone should seal Netanyahu’s fate. Taken together with the fact that it was on his watch that Israel suffered the deadliest attack in its history, the greatest single loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, the verdict on Netanyahu should be clear. Most Israelis admit as much, accepting that once the current war is over, he will have to go.
But that is a curious logic. If he is so obviously culpable for the calamity of 7 October, if it was his serial strategic errors that created the vulnerability exposed and exploited so fatally on that day, what possible qualification does he have to lead Israel’s response now? Speak to Israelis, even on the right, and they will tell you that, as Yaakov Katz, former editor of the Jerusalem Post, put it this week, “the government is not functioning”.The basic duties of the state – whether rehousing the stricken families of the south or getting essential equipment to army reservists at the front – have been taken up instead by a range of civil society groups that have sprung up in the last two weeks. They are filling a void left by Netanyahu, who has overseen an era of cronyism and corruption that has turned the machinery of the state to rust.
For all these reasons, Israelis can’t wait until the war is over. Changing leaders in wartime is not unheard of: it worked out well for Britain in 1940. Admittedly, such a move is unlikely, given Netanyahu’s absolute control of his party. But Israel needs to be rid of the man who led them to this bleak crossroads, and to replace him with someone who will take the right path – one not paved by the country’s mortal enemies.

Our live coverage continues here
Israel says it plans to intensify its attacks on Gaza starting Saturday night, Reuters reports.
Speaking to reporters on Saturday in response to a question about a possible ground invasion into Gaza, the Israeli Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said:
We will deepen our attacks to minimize the dangers to our forces in the next stages of the war. We are going to increase the attacks from today.
Reuters reports that Hagari repeated his calls for Gaza residents to evacuate south.
We’ll close this live blog now and continue our rolling live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war here. Thanks for reading. Here’s an overview of the latest developments as it approaches 7.40am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv.
Israel said it planned to intensify its attacks on Gaza from Saturday night. Speaking to reporters in response to a question about a possible ground invasion into Gaza, Israeli Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said on Saturday: “We will deepen our attacks to minimise the dangers to our forces in the next stages of the war. We are going to increase the attacks from today.” Hagari repeated his calls for Gaza residents to evacuate south.
Israel said its aircraft struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on Saturday and that one of its soldiers was hit by an anti-tank missile, in cross-border fighting that the Iran-backed group said killed six of its fighters. A security source in Lebanon said one Hezbollah fighter was killed in the Lebanese area of Hula, opposite the Israeli community of Margaliot, which Israel said was the target of an anti-tank missile attack. The Israeli army said it fired back. Hezbollah, which claimed attacks on Israeli military positions throughout Saturday, later said five other members were killed.
The Unites States will send a terminal high altitude area defence (Thaad) system and additional Patriot air defence missile system battalions to the Middle East, the Pentagon has said, in response to recent attacks on US troops in the region. Defence secretary Lloyd Austin also said he was placing additional troops on prepare-to-deploy orders, while not saying how many.
Israel says it killed “terror operatives” from Hamas and Islamic Jihad who were planning attacks, in an air strike on a mosque in Jenin on the West Bank. The strike hit the Al-Ansar mosque, which the Israeli military said on Sunday “was used by the terrorists as a command centre to plan the attacks and as a base for their execution”. It did not specify the number killed. The director of the Red Crescent in Jenin, Mahmoud Al-Saadi, said one person was killed and three injured.
Two Palestinians were killed and several wounded in earlier Israeli shelling on the Jenin refugee camp, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.
Canada’s defence department has said Israel was not behind the Al-Ahli hospital explosion in Gaza. Reuters quoted the National Department of Defence as saying in a statement: “Analysis conducted independently by the Canadian Forces Intelligence Command indicates with a high degree of confidence that Israel did not strike the Al-Ahli hospital on 17 October 2023.” The explosion was more likely caused by an errant rocket fired from Gaza, it said, based on analysis of open source and classified reporting. Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike for the killings, while the Israeli army blamed a misfired rocket from Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, which denied it was responsible.
Hamas claimed it had planned to release two more hostages “for humanitarian reasons” but that Israel refused, a Hamas spokesperson said on Saturday. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that “we will not refer to false propaganda by Hamas” and would “continue to act in every way to return all the kidnapped and missing people home”. Abu Ubaida, a spokesperson for the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam brigades, had said it informed Qatar on Friday of Hamas’s intention to release the two hostages.
Hezbollah is “in the heart of the battle”, the deputy leader of the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon said. Sheikh Naim Kassem vowed that Israel would pay a high price whenever it started its ground offensive in Gaza.
Gaza’s healthcare system is “facing collapse”, Médecins Sans Frontières has said. The international medical organisation said on Saturday that Gaza’s hospitals were “overwhelmed and lacking resources”.
Doctors in Gaza have warned that 130 premature babies are in “imminent danger due to a lack of fuel”. “The world cannot simply look on as these babies are killed by the siege in Gaza,” said Melanie Ward, the chief executive of Medical Aid for Palestinians.
The Rafah crossing point between Egypt and Gaza finally opened to allow in a trickle of aid on Saturday for the first time in two weeks, after intense negotiations involving the US, Israel, Egypt and the UN. Under the US-brokered agreement, only 20 trucks were allowed in on Saturday, deliveries from the Egyptian Red Crescent to the Palestinian Red Crescent organisation. Aid officials said they were not expecting a delivery on Sunday, with the next consignment due to be a UN convoy on Monday. Saturday’s entry of humanitarian aid “is a welcomed glimpse of hope but this minuscule aid represents a drop in the ocean”, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, urged all parties to keep the Rafah crossing into Gaza open to enable aid to continue coming through.
The US on Saturday proposed a draft UN security council resolution that says Israel has a right to defend itself and demands Iran stop exporting arms to “militias and terrorist groups threatening peace and security across the region”. Russia plans to hold another UN security council meeting on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Russian deputy UN envoy Dmitry Polyansky said on Saturday.
Qatar’s foreign minister has said it is coordinating with the US and other international partners to release more hostages and reduce escalation in Gaza. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani spoke to US secretary of state Antony Blinken in a phone call on Saturday.
The first Palestinian American to serve as a congressman on the US Capitol is mourning the loss of several family members who were killed at the Greek Orthodox Church in Gaza that was reportedly struck by Israel. Justin Amash detailed his sorrow in a post on X/Twitter.
Up to 100,000 people marched in London on Saturday in support of Palestine, calling on an immediate end to the war.
Thirteen people were reportedly killed in an airstrike above a residential unit in the Gaza city of Deir al-Balah. The report from Reuters, citing Hamas media, has not been independently verified.
The Iraqi prime minister said at peace talks in Cairo that Palestinian people were “facing genocide” and being targeted in hospitals. “It’s a war crime on full scale,” Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said: “We won’t leave, we will remain on our land.” UN secretary general António Guterres told the summit that the time had come for “action to end this godawful nightmare” and called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. “I appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire now,” he said. The UN’s undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs and the emergency relief coordinator, Martin Griffiths, said the humanitarian situation in Gaza “has reached catastrophic levels”.
Israeli commanders have visited frontline units to rally troops who have massed on the border with Gaza pending an anticipated ground assault.
“We will enter Gaza,” chief of staff Lieut Gen Herzi Halevi told one infantry brigade on a visit on Saturday, Agence France-Presse reports.
“Gaza is densely populated, the enemy is preparing a lot of things there – but we are also preparing for them,” Halevi said.
A ground invasion poses myriad challenges for Israeli troops, who are likely to be confronted by Hamas booby traps and tunnels in a densely packed urban environment.
The safety of more than 200 hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 and held in Gaza is another complicating factor.
Canada’s defence department has said Israel was not behind the Al-Ahli hospital explosion in Gaza.
Reuters quoted the department as saying in statement:
Analysis conducted independently by the Canadian Forces Intelligence Command indicates with a high degree of confidence that Israel did not strike the Al-Ahli hospital on 17 October 2023.
The explosion was more likely caused by an errant rocket fired from Gaza, the National Department of Defence said, based on analysis of open source and classified reporting.
Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike for the killings, while the Israeli army blamed a misfired rocket from Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, which denied it was responsible.
Health authorities in the Hamas-ruled enclave originally put the death toll at 471. The US intelligence community later reportedly estimated there were likely 100 to 300 people killed, while saying the assessment may evolve.
This feature from Thursday looks into the efforts to get a clearer picture of who was behind the blast:
The Unites States will send a terminal high altitude area defence (Thaad) system and additional Patriot air defence missile system battalions to the Middle East, the Pentagon has said, in response to recent attacks on US troops in the region.
Reuters quoted defence secretary Lloyd Austin as saying in a statement on Saturday:
Following detailed discussions with President [Joe] Biden on recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces across the Middle East region, today I directed a series of additional steps to further strengthen the Department of Defence posture in the region.
Austin also said he was placing additional troops on prepare-to-deploy orders, while not saying how many.
The Israel Defense Forces has posted apparent images on social media of what it called “a Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist compound” in the Al-Ansar mosque in Jenin on the West Bank.
The IDF has said it killed “terror operatives” in an airstrike on the mosque, without specifying the number, while the Red Crescent in Jenin said one person was killed and three injured.

It’s just turned 5am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s an overview of where things stand, including the latest developments:
Israel said it planned to intensify its attacks on Gaza from Saturday night. Speaking to reporters in response to a question about a possible ground invasion into Gaza, Israeli Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said on Saturday: “We will deepen our attacks to minimise the dangers to our forces in the next stages of the war. We are going to increase the attacks from today.” Hagari repeated his calls for Gaza residents to evacuate south.
Israel said its aircraft struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on Saturday and that one of its soldiers was hit by an anti-tank missile, in cross-border fighting that the Iran-backed group said killed six of its fighters. A security source in Lebanon said one Hezbollah fighter was killed in the Lebanese area of Hula, opposite the Israeli community of Margaliot, which Israel said was the target of an anti-tank missile attack. The Israeli army said it fired back. Hezbollah, which claimed attacks on Israeli military positions throughout Saturday, later said five other members were killed.
Israel says it killed “terror operatives” from Hamas and Islamic Jihad who were planning attacks, in an air strike on a mosque in Jenin on the West Bank. The strike hit the Al-Ansar mosque, which the Israeli military said on Sunday “was used by the terrorists as a command centre to plan the attacks and as a base for their execution”. It did not specify the number killed. The director of the Red Crescent in Jenin, Mahmoud Al-Saadi, said one person was killed and three injured.
Two Palestinians were killed and several wounded in earlier Israeli shelling on the Jenin refugee camp, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.
Hamas claimed it had planned to release two more hostages “for humanitarian reasons” but that Israel refused, a Hamas spokesperson said on Saturday.

Israel says it killed “terror operatives” from Hamas and Islamic Jihad who were planning attacks, in an air strike on a mosque in Jenin on the West Bank.
The strike hit the Al-Ansar mosque, which the Israeli military said on Sunday “was used by the terrorists as a command centre to plan the attacks and as a base for their execution”, Agence France-Presse reports.
The Israeli military said those targeted had already carried out “several terror attacks over the last months and were organising an additional imminent terror attack”.
It said they were “neutralised”, without giving details on the number killed in the strike or their identities.
The United States has proposed a draft UN security council resolution that says Israel has a right to defend itself and demands Iran stop exporting arms to “militias and terrorist groups threatening peace and security across the region”.
Reuters reports that Saturday’s draft text, which it has seen, calls for the protection of civilians – including those who are trying to get to safety – notes that states must comply with international law when responding to “terrorist attacks”, and urges the “continuous, sufficient and unhindered” delivery of aid to the Gaza Strip.
It was not immediately clear if or when the US planned to put the draft resolution to a vote. To pass, a resolution needs at least nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, the US, France or Britain.
The US move comes after it vetoed a Brazilian-drafted text on Wednesday that would have called for humanitarian pauses in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants to allow aid access to Gaza.
As news broke that two Americans held hostage in Gaza had been released by Hamas after talks brokered by Qatar, telephones started ringing in Doha.
France’s Emmanuel Macron and the UK’s Rishi Sunak were among the world leaders waiting at the end of the line, officially to congratulate the tiny Gulf state on its successful negotiations but mostly to ask for help getting their own citizens home.

Mitch McConnell backs Biden’s $106bn aid request for Israel and Ukraine,2023-10-22,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/22/mitch-mcconnell-israel-ukraine-biden-aid,"Republican Senate minority leader says he and president are ‘in the same place’ on support linked to both conflicts
Mitch McConnell offered a strong endorsement on Sunday of the Joe Biden White House’s $106bn aid proposal to Israel and Ukraine, saying he and the president were essentially “in the same place” on the issue.
McConnell, the powerful Republican leader in the Senate, also rebuffed some of his GOP colleagues in the Senate who have called for a package separating assistance for the two countries, saying it would be “a mistake” during an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation.
The Republican leader offered significant backing to the White House’s $106bn request, including $14bn in assistance to Israel, $60bn in aid to Ukraine and another $14bn to improve security on the US Mexico border. An additional $10bn would be allocated to humanitarian relief as well as an additional $7bn to the Indio-Pacific region.
Nine Republican senators wrote a letter to McConnell on Thursday saying that Ukraine and Israel aid should not be paired together. “These are two separate conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to Israel in an attempt to get additional aid for Ukraine across the finish line,” the group wrote.
McConnell rejected that view on Sunday.
“I view it as all interconnected,” he said during the interview. “If you look at the Ukraine assistance, let’s – let’s talk about where the money is really going. A significant portion of it’s being spent in the United States in 38 different states, replacing the weapons that we sent to Ukraine with more modern weapons. So we’re rebuilding our industrial base,” he said.
He added: “No Americans are getting killed in Ukraine. We’re rebuilding our industrial base. The Ukrainians are destroying the army of one of our biggest rivals. I have a hard time finding anything wrong with that. I think it’s wonderful that they’re defending themselves.”
During a speech to the nation on Thursday, Biden also made his case for why the two issues were connected. The president said Hamas and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, “represent different threats, but they share this in common: they both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy – completely annihilate it.
“If we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine’s independence, would-be aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same. The risk of conflict and chaos could spread in other parts of the world – in the Indo-Pacific, in the Middle East, especially in the Middle East.”
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, also said on Sunday that Israel had restored some water and power access to Gaza.
“Israel turned on one of the pipelines six or seven days ago – there are a couple of other pipelines that we’d like to see restored,” the US’s top diplomat said during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press.
Blinken also noted that 20 trucks that were recently allowed in to Gaza provided clean water, saying: “We’re getting more that we hope will be moving as early as today.
“We do have concerns about the spread of disease as a result of people drinking dirty water,” he said. “This is a work in progress. It’s something we’re at all the time.”
Blinken also said Israel had no intention of governing Gaza long term after the war.
“Israel cannot go back to the status quo,” he told NBC. “At the same time, what I’ve heard from the Israelis is absolutely no intent – no desire to be running Gaza themselves. They moved out of Gaza unilaterally, unconditionally a couple of decades ago. But they can’t be in a position where they’re constantly under threat of the most horrific terrorist attacks coming from Gaza. So, something needs to be found that ensures that Hamas cannot do this again, but that also does not revert to Israeli governance of Gaza, which they do not want and do not intend to do.”
While McConnell backed Biden’s aid plan, he did not offer support for Jack Lew, whose nomination to be ambassador to Israel has been held up by Republicans. McConnell said: “He is a very controversial nominee because of his relationship with the Iran nuclear deal, which was opposed by everybody in my party.”
The 81-year-old senator also dismissed a question from CBS’s Margaret Brennan about whether there was more that should be disclosed about his health after multiple cases in which he froze up while speaking in public. “I’m in good shape, completely recovered and back on the job,” he said. He also said he was “concerned” about increasing threats of violence members of Congress have received.
Additionally, McConnell said the US House needed to fill its vacant speakership before 17 November, when funding for the government is set to expire. “We need one because the House can’t do anything without a speaker,” he said. “And it’s a – it’s a problem, but I hope it’s gonna get solved pretty quickly.”
Both Blinken and the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, on Sunday said the US expected the Israel-Hamas war to escalate through involvement by proxies of Iran. They asserted that the Biden administration was prepared to respond if American personnel or armed forces become the target of any such hostilities.
“This is not what we want, not what we’re looking for. We don’t want escalation,” Blinken said. “We don’t want to see our forces or our personnel come under fire. But if that happens, we’re ready for it.”

"I’m an Israeli, but I believe inflicting more harm on Gaza will not bring a solution | Alon-Lee Green",2023-10-22,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/22/i-am-an-israeli-but-believe-inflicting-more-harm-on-gaza-will-not-bring-a-solution,"Two weeks ago, Israel experienced an unprecedented terror attack, when Hamas gunmen crossed the Gaza security fence, massacred more than 260 civilians attending a music festival, took control of several villages and kibbutzim in the area and murdered numerous among their residents, all while firing massive barrages of rockets. Overall, Israeli official sources estimate Hamas killed about 1,400 people, mostly civilians, including children and elderly people, and abducted more than 200, who are still being held hostage in Gaza.
Israel responded by declaring a war on the Gaza Strip, launching airstrikes that have killed more than 4,000 people, according to the health ministry there, mostly civilians, including children, women and elderly people. Israel’s military declared that the emphasis of the airstrikes is on “damage” and not “accuracy”. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, and homes destroyed, after the Israeli government urged 1.1 million people to evacuate their houses. Healthcare, electricity, water and food supplies have been cut, posing a death threat to countless civilians in the Gaza Strip, as Israel imposed a “complete siege”, cutting essential services and blocking humanitarian aid.
Israel’s citizens – Jewish and Arab-Palestinian – have all been devastated by this terrifying situation, which is still unfolding. So many in Israel have family members or loved ones who were murdered or abducted, or know of someone who has been lost; almost everyone there is subject to rocket attacks, from south and north, with, more or less, sheltered houses. For many Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, who comprise 20% of our population, family members and loved ones in Gaza have been killed, injured or are still surviving horrifying living conditions.
The Arab-Palestinian minority within Israel is at the same time part of the Palestinian people as well as citizens of Israel. This tense duality is often exploited by the Israeli government, which provokes and legitimises racism and violence towards its Arab citizens. Although Israel’s Arab citizens had nothing to do with the terror attacks, they have since been classified by the political establishment as suspected “terrorists”, persecuted, discriminated against and disproportionately arrested. Some Arab workers were dismissed simply because they changed their Facebook profile picture to “Stop the War!” in Hebrew, Arabic and English. Arab college students were subjected to disciplinary procedures because they “liked” an Instagram post that highlighted the human suffering in Gaza.
Kobi Shabtai, Israel’s police chief, translated the policies of the hawkish and nationalist government into orders to the police force, and stated quite clearly that he will not tolerate any form of protest that is supportive of the people in the Gaza Strip: “If you want to support Gaza, I’ll put you on a bus there.” His boss, the minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, released a statement warning all Jewish nationals about their Arab fellow citizens, as if he is not also their minister. This further creates barriers, hatred and fear within the Israeli population, and also curtails basic democratic freedoms. Jewish and Palestinian activists of Standing Together, Israel’s grassroots Jewish-Arab movement, who went to hang bilingual posters in Jerusalem were detained by the police and their posters confiscated. The “criminal” message of these was the slogan “Jews and Arabs, we will get through this together”.
In this dark reality, we want to build an alternative. In Standing Together, we believe that these devastating consequences of the atrocious Hamas attack are not inevitable. Inflicting more harm on civilians in Gaza will not lead to a solution. As some of the survivors of the terror attacks have bravely and inspiringly stated, killing civilians for the sake of revenge will only lead to more suffering for civilians; the solution has to be peaceful.
Since 2005, there have been 16 major military operations launched by Israel against the civilian population in Gaza. None of them brought safety and security to Israelis or Palestinians. None laid the ground to any kind of peaceful settlement – rather, each only planted the seed for the next one. The only way to safeguard the lives and wellbeing of both peoples, to protect innocent civilians from harm, is through negotiations towards an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, based on UN resolutions, that will end the occupation and secure freedom, justice and independence for both peoples. I want this not only because I stand in solidarity with Palestinians. I want it for myself and my family – it is the real Israeli interest.
Beyond that, and not less importantly, we – Jewish and Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel – deeply believe that our healing from this immense trauma entails living together in equality and envisioning a shared future. When we grieve together – and when we work in tandem to create change in our communities – we show ourselves and our families that we can swim upstream against our government’s attempts to create barriers between us.
This is why in Standing Together, over the past two weeks, we have continued to help people from all populations with their basic necessities.
We have set up an ad hoc emergency organising effort called the Jewish-Arab Solidarity Guard, with activists working together to collect and distribute equipment and food, as well as games for children; we are using public shelters in our neighbourhoods and organising for people who live in areas without shelters to be hosted by others; and we attend mourning services and comfort families who have lost their loved ones.
We have a hotline, operated by volunteers, where people can ask for assistance. We have been combating racism and dehumanisation, supporting Arab citizens who are being discriminated against and harassed in their workplaces or higher education institutions. We are removing racist, violent signs from public spaces and putting up others calling for peace and solidarity.
We were deeply traumatised in May 2021 when intercommunal violence erupted within shared cities in Israel. Our action helps to prevent a similar escalation between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel now. Our unity, support and humanism all serve as a living example of an alternative, opposed to the present and future of harm and violence that the people currently in power envision. The motto of Standing Together is “Where there is struggle, there is hope”. Even in these times, we are determined to continue to struggle and continue to build hope.
 Alon-Lee Green is national co-director of Standing Together

Israel-Hamas war: second convoy of as 14 aid trucks enters Gaza – as it happened,2023-10-23,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/22/israel-hamas-war-live-gaza-strikes-to-intensify-israeli-military-says-west-bank-mosque-hit,"This blog has closed. You can follow the latest news on the Israel-Hamas conflict on our new blog.
A second aid convoy has crossed the Rafah border crossing and entered Gaza on Sunday as Joe Biden holds further talks with Benjamin Netanyahu.
Announcing the crossing of 14 additional aid trucks with aid provided by the Egyptian Red Crescent and the United Nations, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said:
Another small glimmer of hope for the millions of people in dire need of humanitarian aid. But they need more, much more.
I’m particularly grateful to the aid workers on the Palestinian side who immediately sprang to action to offload the goods – despite the risks. True heroes. They, too, need protection.
Another glimmer of hope. pic.twitter.com/Keq1fuq0sG
The 14 aid trucks on Sunday joins the 20 aid trucks that crossed through the border and into Gaza on Saturday (marking the first convoy of aid that entered into the war-torn strip since 7 October).
International humanitarian organizations have called on the urgent and continous flow of aid into Gaza where over 4,600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli aistrikes while over 14,200 remain injured, the Gaza health ministry reports.
On Sunday, the US president spoke with the Israeli prime minister and welcomed the first two convoys of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. The leaders “affirmed that there will now be continued flow of this critical assistance into Gaza”, the White House said.
It also added that Biden and Netanyahu discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of all the remaining hostages currently held by Hamas, including US citizens. Biden also thanked Netanyahu for Israel’s support in helping accommodate the release of two US hostages earlier this week. According to Israel, 212 hostages are held by Hamas in Gaza.
Pressure has intensified on Israel to negotiate the release of more than 200 people held by Palestinian militants in Gaza, Ruth Michaelson, Julian Borger and Quique Kierszenbaum reported, with desperate families begging officials to help free their loved ones before an anticipated ground invasion.
An Israeli military spokesperson announced on Sunday that more than 212 people were held in Gaza, as officials worked to identify and locate those missing after a deadly incursion by Hamas on 7 October.
On Sunday evening, a group of families of those held hostage in Gaza met the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, at his residence in Jerusalem for almost two hours, as crowds gathered outside, singing songs of mourning.
“Don’t forget us,” one woman called to the crowd – a sea of yellow ribbons, Israeli flags and signs reading “bring them home”.
“The message from the president is that the whole leadership came together to resolve this crisis,” said Eyal Eshel, the father of 19-year-old Roni Eshel, who was serving at a military base near the border with Gaza. “I want to tell the only person that can resolve this, prime minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu: you recruited our girls, our request is you bring them home – all of them.”
Two activists from a Jewish-Arab peace movement were recently detained in Israel for putting up posters with a message that the police deemed to be offensive. The message was: “Jews and Arabs, we will get through this together.”
The activists, members of Standing Together, had their posters confiscated, as well as T-shirts printed with peace slogans in Hebrew and Arabic.
It was not an isolated incident. Across Israel, people are being detained, fired from their jobs, and even attacked for expressing sentiments interpreted by some as showing sympathy for Hamas after the group’s murderous attack on 7 October. The definition of pro-Hamas is often widened to include expressions of sympathy for the plight of Palestinian children trapped in Gaza, or calls for peace, especially if expressed in both Arabic and Hebrew.
Last week, after 15 years of service at a Petah Tikva hospital, its director of the cardiac intensive care unit was suspended from his position.
Abed Samara’s apparent offence was his profile picture on social media – a dove carrying an olive twig and a green flag emblazoned with the shahada, the Muslim declaration of faith: “There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet.” He had adopted the picture last year, long before the Hamas attack, but it was nevertheless seen as somehow voicing support for the outrage.
China views the situation in Gaza as “very serious” with the risk of a large-scale ground conflict rising and the spread of armed conflicts along neighbouring borders, Chinese state media said on Monday, citing the country’s Middle East special envoy.
The envoy Zhai Jun, who is visiting the Middle East, said spillover effects in the region and internationally are widening, as conflict along the Israeli-Lebanese and Israeli-Syrian borders spread, “making the outlook worrisome”, Reuters reported. It writes:
Zhai called on the international community to be “highly vigilant in this regard” and to take immediate action urging parties concerned to strictly abide by international humanitarian law and avoid a serious humanitarian disaster while putting in “joint efforts to control the situation”.
Zhai also said China is willing to do “whatever is conducive” to promote dialogue, achieve ceasefire and restore peace, as well as to promote the two-state solution and a just and lasting resolution to the conflict, China Central Television said.
Last week, Zhai pinned the cause of the Israel-Gaza crisis on the lack of guarantees for Palestinian rights as he met with his Russian counterpart in Qatar, a go-between in the conflict.
Zhai said China will continue maintaining close communication with the international community, including the Arab countries and will next visit the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries in the region to further strengthen coordination aimed at ending the crisis.
Prior to his trip, Zhai had phone calls with the foreign ministry heads of the Palestinians, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Norway, as well as with the special representatives at United Nations and European Union.
Palestinian Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian discussed in a call late on Sunday the means of stopping Israel’s “brutal crimes” in Gaza, Hamas said in a statement according to Reuters.
Israel and the US have said there is no evidence linking Iran to Hamas’ attack on Israel on 7 October, but Iran has praised the assault and Amir-Abdollahian has warned that if Israel does not stop its assault on Gaza, Tehran could intervene.
Iran’s proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, has also been engaged in small-scale cross-border raids on Israel.
Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far right extremist who was in 2007 convicted of racist incitement against Arabs and backing a group considered by Israel and the US to be a terrorist organisation, has criticised the entry of aid into Gaza.
In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, he wrote:
Any agreement on “continuous aid to Gaza” that does not include the release of all our abductees is a continuation of the concept that led us to where we are. Humanitarian aid only in exchange for the release of all the abductees!
The ABC’s interview with IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus referenced concerns that aid agencies have for about 130 premature babies who are in incubators in Gaza’s hospitals.
Doctors and aid groups there have warned that these babies are at “grave risk” as Israel’s blockade on fuel means the hospitals are within days, or sometimes hours of running out of fuel for the generators which power the incubators.
The director of al-Aqsa Hospital in the central Gaza Strip, Iyad Abu Zahar, told the Associated Press news wire, “The responsibility on us is huge.” A bit more from the AP report:
At least seven of the almost 30 hospitals have been forced to shut down due to damage from relentless Israeli strikes and lack of power, water and other supplies. Doctors in the remaining hospitals said they are on the brink. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Sunday it has enough fuel to last three days to serve critical needs.
“The world cannot simply look on as these babies are killed by the siege on Gaza ... A failure to act is to sentence these babies to death,” said Melanie Ward, chief executive of the Medical Aid for Palestinians aid group.
None of the 20 aid trucks that crossed into Gaza on Saturday, the first since the siege was imposed, contained fuel, amid Israeli fears it will end up in Hamas’ hands. Limited fuel supplies inside Gaza were being sent to hospital generators.
A bit more from that ABC interview with IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus. Asked whether a ground invasion of Gaza was inevitable, he said:
The aim here is to totally dismantle Hamas from its military capabilities. If that can be done from the air … with very limited exposure to our troops and less damage on the ground that would be great.
If Hamas were to come out of their hiding places that they hide underneath the civilians … and return our hostages, all 212 of them, and surrender unconditionally, then the war would end.
If they won’t, we will probably have to go in and get it done.
Asked whether invasion had been delayed in order to get the hostages out, he was reluctant to give any insight into Israel’s deliberations:
That’s a very good question. The answer I can provide is that we are going to dismantle Hamas totally and we’re going to bring our people home.
Israeli warplanes bombarded areas near three hospitals in the Gaza Strip early on Monday, Palestinian media reported according to Reuters, but it was not immediately clear whether the hospitals themselves suffered damage. The news agency writes:
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the reports, which said Israel had struck near Gaza City’s Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals and near the Indonesian Hospital, in the enclave’s north.
The director of the Indonesian Hospital told Al Jazeera the Israeli bombardment caused “serious damage and injuries,” without providing details.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the reports. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries at or near the other two hospitals.
Jonathan Conricus, the spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces, has been speaking to Australia’s ABC broadcaster.
He said that any countries accusing Israel of war crimes were not democracies and “were not in any position to lecture Israel about anything related to humanitarian issues”.
Anyone out protesting against Israel was either “uninformed or really filed with hate towards Israel based on things that have nothing to do with what’s going on in Gaza right now.
Asked about the siege of Gaza, including the cutting off of water supplies and accusations that Israel was imposing collective punishment on the area’s inhabitants, Conricus said Israel in fact had only ever supplied about 10 per cent of the water to Gaza. The rest was pumped from Gaza’s aquifer, he said (although as the ABC interviewer pointed out, without fuel, which Israel has also cut off, this is no longer possible).
“I don’t think we should be forced to provide sustenance to the very same enemy that is firing rockets at our civilians and trying to kill our civilians,” Conricus said. He also claimed that there was still fuel in Gaza, which had been stolen by Hamas.
Asked about UNICEF concerns over newborn babies in hospital incubators in northern Gaza, where everyone has been told to evacuate or risk being considered a terrorist supporter, Conricus replied:
We will not target the civilian popular, they are not our enemy. We have told the civilian population to evacuate northern Gaza out of concern for their safety ... we have said that the effort should be made by anyone who can.
The leaders of the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy and Canada have reiterated their support for Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism but “called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians” in a joint statement issued after a telephone call.
They welcomed the release of two hostages and called for the immediate release of all remaining hostages. They committed to close coordination to support their nationals in the region, in particular those wishing to leave Gaza.
The leaders also welcomed news that the first convoys of humanitarian aid have been allowed into Gaza and said they would continue “coordinating with partners in the region to ensure sustained and safe access to food, water, medical care, and other assistance”.
The leaders committed to continue close diplomatic coordination, including with key partners in the region, to prevent the conflict from spreading, preserve stability in the Middle East, and work toward a political solution and durable peace.
Israeli aircraft struck two Hezbollah cells in Lebanon early on Monday, which were planning to launch anti-tank missiles and rockets toward Israel, its military said, as fighting flared across the two countries’ shared border. Reuters reports:
Lebanon’s state-run news agency NNA reported an Israeli air strike on the southern outskirts of Aitaroun, in southern Lebanon. It did not provide details.
The military said one cell was adjacent to the Israeli town of Mattat, around 13 kilometres (8 miles) southwest of Aitaroun. It said the other was further north in the disputed Shebaa Farms area. The military said it struck both cells before they fired.
It was not immediately clear if the two sides were referring to the same set of incidents.
Justin Trudeau has spoken with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, about the “terrorist organization Hamas’ brutal attacks”, the Canadian prime minister said on Twitter.
He reaffirmed Israel’s “right to defend itself in accordance with international law”, he said and added:
We spoke about the hostages held by Hamas, and the need for their immediate release. I also expressed my concern for the humanitarian situation in Gaza, and my support for the right of both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security.
Today, I spoke with President @Isaac_Herzog about the terrorist organization Hamas’ brutal attacks. I expressed my condolences for the victims and all affected. I also reaffirmed Canada’s support for Israel’s right to defend itself in accordance with international law.
This is Helen Livingstone, taking over from my colleague Maya Yang.
It is nearly 2am in Gaza and Tel Aviv. Here is a summary of the latest headlines:
A second aid convoy comprising of 14 trucks has crossed the Rafah border crossing and entered Gaza on Sunday. Announcing the crossing, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said: “Another small glimmer of hope for the millions of people in dire need of humanitarian aid. But they need more, much more.”
Pope Francis has once again urged for the end of the Israel-Hamas war, calling for humanitarian aid to delivered and for hostages to be released. Speaking at his Sunday prayer, Francis said: “War is always a defeat, it is a destruction of human fraternity. Brothers, stop! Stop!”
Thousands of people gathered in Berlin and London to oppose antisemitism and support Israel on Sunday. Earlier, German chancellor Olaf Scholz inaugurated a new synagogue in Dessau and said he was “outraged” by the rise in antisemitism since the war broke out on 7 October.
Thousands of people attended a rally in Paris in what is the first pro-Palestinian demonstration allowed by police since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. Reuters reports around 15,000 people showed up at the Place de la Republique, according to police figures, to express their solidarity with Palestinians.
At least three Palestinians were killed on Sunday night in an Israeli air strike in Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, medics and witnesses told Reuters. Several others were wounded.
UNRWA, or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, has announced that 29 of its colleagues in Gaza have been killed since 7 October. According to the agency, half of these colleagues were UNRWA teachers.
Joe Biden held a call on Sunday with the leaders of Canada, France, Britain, Germany and Italy to discuss the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, the White House said. Earlier in the day, the US president held a call with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
Benjamin Netanyahu said that French president Emmanuel Macron and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte will visit Israel next week, Reuters reports. The Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement that the two leaders “will arrive on Monday and Tuesday” and meet with Netanyahu.
Israel “cannot go back to the status quo”, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said in his NBC interview on Sunday. When asked whether it is clear who is going to govern Gaza once the war is over, Blinken said: “They can’t go back to the status quo with Hamas being in a position in terms of its governance of Gaza to repeat what it did.”
The Israeli military reports that one of its tanks accidentally hit an Egyptian post near the Gaza border and expresses sorrow over the incident, Reuters reports. An Egyptian army spokesperson said that border watchmen sustained minor injuries.
Here are some images coming out of Gaza where the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli strikes have risen to over 4,700 since 7 October:
Here is video of Pope Francis urging for the end of the Israel-Hamas war on Sunday.
Speaking to a crowd at his traditional Angelus prayer at Saint Peter’s Square in Rome, Francis said:
War is always a defeat, it is a destruction of human fraternity. Brothers, stop! Stop!
He went on to add:
I renew my call for spaces to be opened, for humanitarian aid to continue to arrive and for hostages to be freed.

Joe Biden has spoken with Pope Francis to discuss the latest developments in Israel and Gaza.
According to a readout released by the White House on Sunday, the US president discussed his recent visit to Israel with the Pope, as well as his efforts to ensure delivery of food, medicine and other humanitarian assistance.
“They also discussed the need to prevent escalation in the region and to work toward a durable peace in the Middle East,” the readout said.

Good afternoon. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has landed in the US for a critical four-day visit where the Israel-Hamas war will feature prominently on the agenda.
On the ground, a second convoy of 14 aid trucks has entered the Gaza Strip as Israel steps up its bombardment of the enclave. The UN has warned that the volume of aid is a fraction of what is needed, and the White House has promised a “continued flow” of aid into Gaza. On the diplomatic front, Western leaders have issued a joint statement urging Israel abide by international law while underscoring their support for the country, and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is due to land in Tehran to discuss the crisis.
Israel says it is intensifying its attacks in the north of Gaza, while Palestinian media reported airstrikes in the strip’s southern cities hours after the Israeli military called on Gaza’s residents to move south “for your own safety”.

"RBA’s top two executives saw 10% pay increase over past year, report reveals",2023-10-24,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/19/rba-top-two-executives-saw-10-pay-increase-over-past-year-report-reveals,"Annual report notes Philip Lowe and Michele Bullock’s remuneration increase was recommended by an independent committee
The Reserve Bank’s top two executives clocked up remuneration gains of more than 10% in the past year, or not far shy of twice the inflation rate.
During his final year as governor, Philip Lowe took home $1,147,465 in base pay, bonuses, superannuation and other payments. That sum was about 10.5% higher than a year earlier, according to the bank’s annual report, which released on Thursday.
Michele Bullock, who was deputy governor prior to her promotion to the top role last month, earned remuneration totalling $828,313. That sum was almost 12% more than in the previous year when Bullock was an assistant governor for part of the period.
Payment for the two positions are recommended by the RBA’s remuneration committee and neither the governor nor the deputy take part in the decisions, the report said. In addition, the report listed 171 “highly paid” staff who were paid at least $240,000.
The 2022-23 fiscal year included 10 of the 12 increases in the official interest rate. Since May 2022, the cash rate has increased by 400 basis points, lifting the share of disposable household income going to debt repayments to a record of almost 10%.
The RBA has left rates on hold for four months in a row, but a 13th increase in the current series is on the cards if September quarter inflation figures – due out on 25 October – surprise on the high side.

The RBA’s own balance sheet posted another $6bn in losses, extending the central bank’s negative equity position to $17.7bn. The losses resulted mostly from the lower market value of its bonds holdings, which fell as yields increased in the past year.
The negative equity “does not affect the bank’s operations or its ability to perform its policy functions,” Lowe said in a foreword to the report.
“Nonetheless, the board will seek to restore the bank’s capital over time through the retention of future profits, rather than paying these as dividends to the government,” he said.
“The treasurer [Jim Chalmers] has indicated his continued support for this approach, noting that a decision about retention of earnings is made each year.”

The RBA has historically made a profit in most years on its market operations, turning over billions of dollars to treasury.
The RBA said governor Lowe received a 2.75% increase from 1 July 2022 after two years when the award set by the Remuneration Tribunal had been flat.
Lowe’s increase for the year was also made larger by accounting tweaks, including changes in accrued leave entitlements, the bank said.

Israeli military preparing ‘unrelenting attacks’ – as it happened,2023-10-24,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/23/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-airstrikes-gaza-aid-rafah-border-crossing-egypt-white-house-joe-biden-latest-news,"This blog has now closed.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that they helped facilitate the release of two hostages held by Hamas, in a new post to X.
In the statement posted online, ICRC confirmed that they transported the two hostages out of Gaza Monday evening.
“Our role as a neutral intermediary makes this work possible & we are ready to facilitate any future release,” the ICRC post read.
“We hope that they will soon be back with their loved ones.”

Israeli chief of staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi issued a statement late on Monday suggesting that Israel had no intention of curbing its strikes on the densely populated Gaza Strip and hinting that it was well prepared for a ground assault.
“We want to bring Hamas to a state of full dismantling,” Halevi said. “The path is a path of unrelenting attacks, damaging Hamas everywhere and in every way.’
“We are well prepared for the ground operations in the south,” he added, referring to southern Israel, which borders Gaza. “Troops who have more time are better prepared, and that is what we are doing now.”
Heres a bit more from the director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza, Thomas White, who told the BBC that a shortage of shelter, food and drinking water in the south of Gaza had forced some residents to return to their homes in the north.
“People have left everything in the north … they’ve come to the south where they are struggling to find shelter, food is scarce, many people are having to drink unpotable water, so the situation in the south is dire,” White told the BBC.
Israel delivered sweeping evacuation orders for almost half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people on 13 October. The UN estimates that almost two-thirds of Gaza’s population have been displaced over the last two weeks.
The US has said now is not the time for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, as the UN reports that some Palestinians who fled their homes in the north of Gaza have returned due to a lack of food and shelter in the south.
On Monday, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told CNN that Israel still had “work to do to go after Hamas leadership”, echoing comments from the US president, Joe Biden, that any discussions of a ceasefire could only take place if Hamas freed all its hostages in Gaza.
The statement from the White House was at odds with comments from UN and EU officials who on Monday called for a humanitarian pause in fighting so that aid could be delivered into Gaza.
The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC on Monday that a shortage of shelter, food and drinking water in the south had forced some residents to return to their homes in the north.
Here’s our full report:
President Joe Biden “underscored the need to sustain a continuous flow of urgently needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza” in a phone call with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House has said.
The US leader also updated Netanyahu on US support for Israel and “ongoing efforts at regional deterrence, to include new US military deployments”, the statement said.
The White House also said the president had welcomed the release of two hostages from Gaza and reaffirmed his commitment to securing the release of the remaining hostages as well as safe passage for US citizens and other civilians in Gaza.
Here are some of the most recent images coming to us from Gaza:
Israel would not allow fuel into Gaza even if all hostages are released, Mark Regev, a senior advisor to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has told CNN. He said:
At the moment we have no interest in more fuel going to the Hamas military machine and we have not authorized fuel, we have authorized medicine, we have authorized water. We’ve authorized foodstuffs, we’ve not authorized anything else.
Asked if Israel would allow fuel to enter Gaza if all hostages were released, Regev said Israel’s position would not change.
The government decision is that fuel doesn’t go in because it will be stolen by Hamas and it’ll be used by them to power rockets that are fired into Israel to kill our people.
Israel will not delay a possible ground invasion of Gaza over concerns for the more than 200 hostages being held there by Hamas, the country’s energy minister has told German tabloid Bild.
Israel Katz, who had previously insisted that not an “electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter” Gaza, until the hostages were freed, told the paper:
We are doing everything we can and working with every interlocuter we can to bring those kidnapped home… But that cannot prevent our other actions, including the ground invasion, if we decide to do it, because that’s what Hamas wants.
Huge billboards depicting leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah looking beaten and bound as Israeli soldiers stand over them, line the main thoroughfares in the coastal city of Tel Aviv.
The words: “We love you, we trust you,” directed at the Israeli army and: “Never again,” are printed big and bold. The graphic AI-generated imagery has elicited different responses from the Israeli public; some find the campaign repugnant, many others have welcomed it.
Ofer Rosenbaum, 36, whose PR work has had previous brushes with controversy, is behind the provocative campaign launched last week that he hopes will help restore trust in Israel’s security forces.
Observing a billboard from across the highway, retired accountant Simona Yaloz, 65, said she was disgusted by the image. “I hate it, really, it’s not the Israeli attitude,” Yaloz said. “This is very extreme, it’s too violent. There are extreme people here but we’re trying to avoid it.”
Fashion designer Shiran, who only gave one name, said she and her husband were supportive of the billboard campaign. “We both smiled when we saw it. I think we’ve been too kind and too nice for too long. We’ve let people outside of Israel tell us what we can and can’t do,” said the 30-year-old.
Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte was in Israel on Monday, as international leaders continued diplomacy aimed at showing solidarity with Israel while also calling for restraint in its response to Hamas’ 7 October attack.
It was of “existential importance for Israel to remove the Hamas threat,” Rutte said in a statement after meeting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
But he added that the aid arriving in Gaza was “not nearly enough” and that “civilian casualties and regional escalation must be prevented”.
This requires restraint from Israel when it comes to the use of force.
He also called for a return to talks on a two-state solution:
Though it may seem far away, peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians is only possible if prospects for a Palestinian state, alongside a secure Israel, are renewed.
The Pentagon is sending military advisers and sophisticated air defense systems to Israel ahead of an anticipated ground assault into Gaza by Israel’s military.
One of the officers leading the assistance is Marine Corps Lt Gen James Glynn, who previously helped lead special operations forces against the Islamic State and served a high-profile role during intense combat in Falluja, one of the bloodiest and most controversial centers of battle for US forces during the war in Iraq.
Glynn will also be advising on how to mitigate civilian casualties during urban warfare, a US official told the Associated Press, on condition of anonymity.
Glynn and the other military officers who are advising Israel “have experience that is appropriate to the sorts of operations that Israel is conducting”, the national security council spokesman, John Kirby, said on Monday in a briefing at the White House.
The Israeli military has confirmed Palestinian reports of an airstrike on a refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to Reuters.
The Israeli airstrike targeted a staging ground for Hamas in Al-Shati refugee camp, a military spokesperson said without providing any further details.
Palestinian media have reported that five people were killed while a spokesperson for the Hamas-run health ministry has said children and women were among the casualties.
Washington is concerned that Israel lacks achievable military objectives in Gaza and does not yet have a workable plan for a ground invasion, the New York Times has reported, citing senior officials in the Biden administration.
Defense secretary Lloyd J Austin has stressed the need for careful consideration of how a ground invasion would be conducted in conversations with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant, the paper wrote.
It added that Biden officials still insist they support an invasion and that they are not telling Israel what to do.
However the NYT also said that in conversations with Israeli officials about prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s aim of eradicating Hamas, the Americans had not yet seen an achievable plan of action and there were concerns that a ground operation could be extremely bloody for civilians as well as troops.
“The first thing that everyone should know, and I think everyone does know, is that urban combat is extremely difficult,” Austin told ABC News’s This Week on Sunday.
There was no immediate Israeli response to the report but a diplomat from the Israeli Embassy denied that the US government was advising the Israelis to delay the ground invasion, as the paper reported on Sunday.
Here’s a bit more from Obama’s statement on the Israel-Hamas conflict, in which he said that it is important that “Israel’s military strategy abides by international law, including those laws that seek to avoid, to every extent possible, the death or suffering of civilian populations”. He wrote:
Upholding these values is important for its own sake – because it is morally just and reflects our belief in the inherent value of every human life.
Upholding these values is also vital for building alliances and shaping international opinion – all of which are critical for Israel’s long-term security.
He noted that this presented an “enormously difficult task”, one at which the US “had at times fallen short of”. And after an attack that evoked “some of the darkest memories of persecution against the Jewish people”, Israeli citizens were understandably demanding their government do “whatever it takes to root out Hamas and make sure such attacks never happen again”, he said. However, he continued:
In dealing with what is an extraordinarily complex situation where so many people are in pain and passions are understandably running high, all of us need to do our best to put our best values, rather than our worst fears, on display.
That meant opposing anti-semitism and “efforts to minimize the terrible tragedy that the Israeli people have just endured as well as the morally-bankrupt suggestion that any cause can somehow justify the deliberate slaughter of innocent people”.
It also meant rejecting anti-Muslim, anti-Arab or anti-Palestinian sentiment, he said.
It means refusing to lump all Palestinians with Hamas or other terrorist groups. It means guarding against dehumanizing language towards the people of Gaza, or downplaying Palestinian suffering - whether in Gaza or the West Bank – as irrelevant or illegitimate.
Israel’s siege and bombardment of Gaza following the Hamas attack of 7 October risks backfiring and ultimately undermining long term efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region, Barack Obama has said.
“Even as we support Israel, we should also be clear that how Israel prosecutes this fight against Hamas matters,” the former US president said in a statement that also emphasised Israel’s “right to defend its citizens against such wanton violence”. He continued:
The world is watching closely as events in the region unfold, and any Israeli military strategy that ignores the human costs could ultimately backfire.
Thousands of Palestinians, including many children, had already been killed by Israeli strikes on Gaza, while hundreds of thousands had been forced from their homes, Obama wrote.
The Israeli government’s decision to cut off food, water and electricity to a captive civilian population threatens not only to worsen a growing humanitarian crisis; it could further harden Palestinian attitudes for generations, erode global support for Israel, play into the hands of Israel’s enemies, and undermine long term efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region.
Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi has said Beijing is “deeply concerned” by the escalating war between Israel and Hamas and called on Israel to respect humanitarian law in a phone call with his Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen, Chinese state media has reported.
All countries have a right to self-defence but China condemns all acts that harm civilians and opposes any violation of the international law, Wang said, according to Xinhua.
The conflict affects the whole world, he added, and “involves a major choice between war and peace”. Xinhua wrote that he stressed:
The painful lesson of the repeated cycle of Palestinian-Israeli conflict fully demonstrates: only adhering to the concept of common security can help achieve sustainable security, and only adhering to the direction of political settlement can facilitate the thorough resolution of Israel’s legitimate security concerns.
The two-state solution is the consensus of the international community.
Wang said he hoped both sides could consider “ long-term interests of peace and security shared by future generations” and that they would resume peace talks.
Israel struck a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip late on Monday, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, Reuters has reported. The Israeli military did not immediately provide comment.
In a statement on Facebook, health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qudra said the Israeli bombardment targeted Gaza’s Al-Shati camp, which abuts the Mediterranean coastline.
Palestinian media reported that five people were killed in the camp. Reuters could not immediately confirm the reports.

UN chief calls Gaza situation ‘dire’ – as it happened,2023-10-25,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/24/israel-hamas-war-live-news-conflict-biden-netanyahu-aid-gaza-hostages-latest-updates,"This blog has now closed.

The United Nations’ secretary general has called for an immediate ceasefire to end “epic suffering” in the Gaza Strip after Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed more than 700 people in a single day and hospitals began to shut down for lack of fuel.
António Guterres said the bombardment and blockade of Gaza amounted to the “collective punishment of the Palestinian people” and violated international law, comments that sparked a fierce row with Israel.
“To ease epic suffering, make the delivery of aid easier and safer and facilitate the release of hostages. I reiterate my appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” he said.
Guterres said the 7 October attacks by Hamas were “appalling” but did not happen in a vacuum. “The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation,” he said. “They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.”
Israel’s envoy to the UN, Gilad Erdan, called on Guterres to resign immediately, accusing him of being detached from reality. “His comments … constitute a justification for terrorism and murder. It’s sad that a person with such views is the head of an organisation that arose after the Holocaust.”
Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, cancelled a planned meeting with Gutteres.
Here’s our full report on the day’s events:
This blog is closing now. You can follow the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict here.
On Tuesday the friends and family of Dana Bachar and her son Carmel mourned their loss at Gan Shlomo cemetery. The pair were killed during Hamas’ 7 October attack on kibbutz Be’eri.
Over a third of hospitals, or 12 out of 35, have shut down in Gaza and almost two thirds of primary care clinics, or 46 of 72, have closed due to damage from hostilities or lack of fuel, the UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA has said in its daily update.
As we reported earlier, UNRWA, the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees has warned that unless fuel is allowed in to Gaza immediately, it will be forced to halt all operations as of Wednesday night.
In its update, OCHA itemised some of the aid that has been allowed in over the past few days. It noted that on Sunday trucks brought in 44,000 bottles of water, enough for just 22,000 people in one day and on Monday trucks brought enough water for just 13,000 people for one day.
It noted that the Israeli military had indicated that they have attacked 400 targets, a new high since the start of hostilities and noted that residential buildings and a busy market had been among the targets. It said:
In one of the airstrikes, a residential building in Rafah was destroyed, killing 48 people and injuring dozens. In Ash Shati refugee camp, airstrikes destroyed three residential buildings overnight, resulting in 36 fatalities, with many others reportedly missing, presumably under the rubble.
Airstrikes also struck Souq An Nuseirat with at least 20 fatalities. The incident took place at noon when the market was the busiest. Shoppers were hit while they were inside a large supermarket.
The death toll in the Israeli drone strike on the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank has risen to three, the Palestinian news agency Wafa has reported, citing Wissam Bakr, director of Jenin Governmental hospital.
The drone fired at least two projectiles, Wafa reported, citing sources in the camp.
Reuters is reporting that US intelligence officials have “high confidence” that an explosion at a Gaza hospital last week was caused by a Palestinian rocket that broke up mid-flight, and not by Israel.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said 471 people were killed in the blast at the Al-Ahli Arab hospital on 17 October. Hamas said an Israeli airstrike hit the hospital, while Israel said the blast was caused by a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian militant Islamic Jihad group, which has denied responsibility.
The Reuters report was based on testimony from an unnamed official and other US media reports.
The officials said there was still uncertainty around the death toll and the number of injuries, according to the New York Times. The officials also said there was little damage to the hospital and the structure did not collapse, the newspaper reported.
The intelligence assessment was based on Israeli intercepts of Palestinian groups, publicly available video, communications intercepts provided by the Israelis and images of the blast and the aftermath, the officials told the newspaper.
British families of those being held hostage by Hamas are continuing to hold out hope after the release of two further captives.
British psychotherapist Noam Sagi, whose elderly mother Ada is being held hostage by Hamas, said the release of the two elderly hostages on Monday had offered “some hope” for the future.
Downing Street on Tuesday said that at least 12 British nationals were killed in Hamas’s attack on Israel and a further five are still missing, with some of them believed to have been kidnapped. The UK Foreign Office said that officials were working “tirelessly” to save them.
“We will continue to work tirelessly with Qatar, Israel and others to ensure all hostages come home safely,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said according to PA Media.
It comes as UK foreign secretary James Cleverly said he met with some of those whose family members were killed or are still missing.

Israel’s military has dropped leaflets in Gaza, offering protection and a reward to Palestinians who contact them with information about hostages held by Hamas, in its latest effort to free more than 200 people seized during the terrorist attacks that killed 1,400 people on 7 October.
The move underlines the difficulties facing the Israeli government as it tries to reconcile its stated aim to “crush Hamas” with saving the lives of as many hostages as possible.
So far, four female hostages have been released after negotiations brokered by Qatar, which is also believed to be trying to reach a deal in which 50 more dual nationals held by Hamas would be released.
The Israeli military is using surveillance, special forces raids and interrogation of captured members of Hamas to draw up a picture of where the captives – including infants, children and elderly civilians as well male and female soldiers – are being held.
The leaflets will complement this effort but also seek to sow uncertainty among Hamas supporters about who might have accepted the Israeli offer. Many were torn up immediately by residents in Gaza, witnesses reported.
As the death toll from Israeli airstrikes in Gaza rises, the Associated Press has sent this report from inside the enclave:
Across central and south Gaza, where Israel told civilians to take shelter, there were multiple scenes of rescuers pulling the dead and wounded out of large piles of rubble from collapsed buildings.
Graphic photos and video shot by the AP showed rescuers unearthing bodies of children from multiple ruins.
A father knelt on the floor of the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah next to the bodies of three dead children cocooned in bloodied sheets. Later at the nearby morgue, workers prayed over 24 dead wrapped in body bags, several of them the size of small children.
Buildings that collapsed on residents killed dozens at a time in several cases, witnesses said. Two families lost a total 47 members in a leveled home in Rafah, the Health Ministry said.
A strike on a four-story building in Khan Younis killed at least 32 people, including 13 members of the Saqallah family, said Ammar al-Butta, a relative who survived the airstrike. He said there were about 100 people sheltering in the building, including many who had evacuated from Gaza City.
“We thought that our area would be safe,” he said.
Another strike destroyed a bustling marketplace in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, witnesses said. AP photos showed the floor of a vegetable shop covered with blood.
In Gaza City, at least 19 people were killed when an airstrike hit the house of the Bahloul family, according to survivors, who said dozens more people remained buried.
The legs of a dead woman and another person, both still half buried, dangled out of the wreckage where workers dug through the dirt, concrete and rebar.
The Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari has backed academics and peace activists in his home country in an attack on the “indifference” of some American and European progressives to Hamas atrocities, accusing them of “extreme moral insensitivity” and betraying leftwing politics.
Harari – the author of bestselling books including Sapiens and Homo Deus – joined 90 signatories of a statement expressing dismay with “elements within the global left … until now, our political partners” who had, on occasion, “justified Hamas’s actions”.
The 47-year-old, who has recently become a high-profile political activist in Israel, opposing Benjamin Netanyahu’s rightwing populist coalition and its plan to weaken judicial oversight, told the Guardian he intervened after speaking with peace activists in his home country who were “completely devastated” and “feeling abandoned and betrayed by supposed allies” in peace efforts, after academics, artists and intellectuals signed letters which failed to condemn Hamas.
Speaking about the reaction from parts of the left in the US and Europe while on a visit to London, Harari said it was “shocking to hear some of the responses that did not only not condemn Hamas, but placed all responsibility on Israel” and to see “the lack of solidarity with regard to the horrific attacks on Israeli civilians”.
Israeli forces on an overnight raid in the occupied West Bank came under fire by a group of Palestinians whom the military then targeted with a drone strike, the Israeli military said on Wednesday, and medics said two Palestinians were killed. Reuters reports:
The military said armed Palestinians “fired and hurled explosive devices” at its forces in Jenin refugee camp, in the northern West Bank. The military then struck them with a drone, and “hits were identified”, it added.
The Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance service said two Palestinians were killed, with others injured.
The strike was at least the third use of Israeli air power in the West Bank since violence in the territory surged after Hamas’ Oct. 7 gun rampage in southern Israel.
Jenin refugee camp, a Palestinian militant stronghold, was the focus of a major Israeli military operation earlier this year.
As we look for more details of what’s happening in the city of Jenin right now, here are some of the most recent images that have come to us from the West Bank.
The United Nations’ secretary general has called for an immediate ceasefire to end “epic suffering” in the Gaza Strip after Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed more than 700 people in a single day and hospitals began to shut down for lack of fuel.
António Guterres said the bombardment and blockade of Gaza amounted to the “collective punishment of the Palestinian people” and violated international law, comments that sparked a fierce row with Israel.
“To ease epic suffering, make the delivery of aid easier and safer and facilitate the release of hostages. I reiterate my appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” he said.
Guterres said the 7 October attacks by Hamas were “appalling” but did not happen in a vacuum. “The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation,” he said. “They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.”
Israel’s envoy to the UN, Gilad Erdan, called on Guterres to resign immediately, accusing him of being detached from reality. “His comments … constitute a justification for terrorism and murder. It’s sad that a person with such views is the head of an organisation that arose after the Holocaust.”
Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, cancelled a planned meeting with Gutteres.
Here’s our full report on the day’s events:
Israel’s military has carried out a drone strike on the West Bank city of Jenin during clashes with armed Palestinians, the Israel Defence Forces has said, according to Reuters.
We’ll bring you more on that when we have more detail.
More than 90 people are reported to have been killed and 1,200 arrested by Israeli forces in the West Bank since 7 October, Bethan McKernan and Sufian Taha reported, amid fears that the occupied Palestinian territory could erupt in a fresh wave of even more violence.
At least eight Palestinian communities have been forced to leave their land in the face of escalating violence from Israeli settlers. In Wadi as-Seeq, near Ramallah, soldiers and settlers detained three Palestinians, stripping them to their underwear before beating them, urinating on them, extinguishing cigarettes on them, and sexually assaulting them. The IDF has opened an investigation.
Here’s a taste from Bethan and Sufian’s report:
In their uncle’s house, next door to the ruins of their demolished home, two young boys from Aqbat Jaber refugee camp in the occupied West Bank were still asleep at midmorning.
A few nights ago, their own bedroom was blown up during an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) operation in the camp on the outskirts of Jericho: it was targeted because the boys’ father, Maher Shalon, has been arrested on suspicion of killing an Israeli settler. A 17-year-old Palestinian was killed during the raid on Friday, six people injured, and two arrested.
After the family home was destroyed, the boys’ mother took their older brother to Bethlehem for medical treatment. The younger children are now being cared for by their uncle, Mansour, and their paternal grandmother, Hamda. According to them, the boys have not gone outside since.
“The Israelis are coming almost every day since 7 October,” said Mansour, 56, referring to the date the Palestinian militant group Hamas broke out of the besieged Gaza Strip, massacring 1,400 Israelis and sparking a new war in which more than 5,700 Palestinians in the coastal exclave have been killed.
Australia has called for humanitarian pauses in hostilities and said “the way Israel exercises its right to defend itself matters,” in a statement by foreign minister Penny Wong. She said:
Innocent Palestinian civilians should not suffer because of the outrages perpetrated by Hamas.
Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people and undermines the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.
She said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “dire” and called for “safe, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access, and safe passage for civilians,” saying the access allowed in recent days was “nowhere near enough”.
She continued:
The way Israel exercises its right to defend itself matters. It matters to civilians throughout the region, and it matters to Israel’s ongoing security.

Netanyahu says war cabinet ‘working around the clock’ – as it happened,2023-10-26,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/25/israel-hamas-war-live-news-gaza-child-deaths-unicef-jenin-west-bank-strike,"This blog is closed. Our latest live coverage is here.
Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas is “doomed” during a televised statement on Wednesday.
Israel’s military are “getting prepared” for the ground invasion with the goal of destroying Hamas’s military and governmental capabilities, the Israeli prime minister said. The country’s war cabinet are “working around the clock” until it reaches victory, he said.
Netanyahu said he would not provide any details about the ground invasion to “secure the lives of our soldiers”. However, he said the timing of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operation will be “unanimously” determined by Israel’s war cabinet.
This blog is now closing. We’ve launched a new blog at the link below:
AFP: EU leaders will on Thursday debate calling for a “humanitarian pause” in Israel’s war with Hamas.
The 27-nation bloc has long been split between more pro-Palestinian members such as Ireland and Spain, and staunch backers of Israel including Germany and Austria.
After days of negotiations, a draft statement for the summit calls “for continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including a humanitarian pause”.
That statement – which could change when leaders meet in Brussels – falls short of demands from the United Nations for a “ceasefire”.
Germany, wary of urging a more definitive halt that could tie Israel’s hands, has mooted calls for humanitarian “windows” or “pauses” in the plural.
“Letters, commas, language matter, and that’s how you find agreements,” said a senior EU official.
But diplomats from some EU nations warn that delays over finding the right words as the death toll mounts are hitting the bloc’s global standing and leaving it flailing in the face of developments.
AP: Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have decided to stay in their homes in northern Gaza, despite Israeli warnings that they face grave danger if they don’t move south.
They say evacuation doesn’t make sense considering the relentless bombardment of southern Gaza, where Israel has repeatedly urged the more than one million residents of northern Gaza to seek refuge.
If they flee, they face appalling conditions in overcrowded shelters and persistent shortages of food and water in the south. It is estimated that 350,000 civilians have remained in the north, even as Israel edges closer to a planned ground offensive.
AFP: Cryptocurrency has become the latest front in the conflict between Israel and Hamas, analysts say.
Israeli and US authorities have intensified their financial hunt into Hamas in recent days as they track illicit funds via digital currencies.
Ari Redbord, global policy head at crypto tracking specialist TRM Labs, said there is now less crypto transfer activity on pro-Hamas support networks as a result.
“We are seeing a lot less activity in some respects since the war began,” Redbord told AFP.
This is “primarily because Israel has been very aggressive and successful in taking down these fundraising efforts”, he added.
Two weeks ago, Israeli police revealed they had located and frozen accounts linked to Hamas that sought “to solicit donations on social networks” via Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange.
A Binance spokeswoman said it “follows internationally recognised sanctions rules, blocking the small number of accounts linked to illicit funds”.
Redbord, formerly a senior US government adviser, said Hamas had adopted crypto from 2019 at the latest, to seek funding via the Telegram messaging network and even on its own website.
Hamas decided in April that it would no longer accept cash via Bitcoin due to increased global surveillance of the world’s biggest digital unit.
Crypto fundraising is now operated via a network of Hamas-linked support groups.
Here is the video of Biden’s speech earlier in which he called for end to attacks by West Bank settlers and accused Hamas of hiding behind civilians in Gaza.
He also said Israel also must follow the ‘laws of war’. Speaking at a joint press conference with the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, the president said US support for Israel’s defence was ironclad, but criticised the treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank by some Israelis:
UNRWA has been sharing its own fuel supplies so that trucks can distribute aid, bakeries can feed people in shelters, water can be desalinated, and hospitals can keep incubators, life support machines and other vital equipment working.
If it continues doing all of that, fuel will run out by Thursday, so the agency is deciding how to ration its supply, UNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai told The Associated Press.
“Do we give for the incubators or the bakeries? Do we bump clean water or do we send trucks to the borders?” she said. “It is an excruciating decision.”
AP: More than half of Gaza’s primary health care facilities and roughly a third of its hospitals have stopped functioning, the World Health Organization said.
At Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital, the lack of medicine and clean water have led to “alarming” infection rates, the group Doctors Without Borders said. Amputations are often required to prevent infection from spreading in the wounded, it said.
One surgeon with the group described amputating half the foot of a 9-year-old boy with “slight sedation” on a hallway floor as his mother and sister watched.
In a swath of Gaza City’s Yarmouk neighborhood reduced to splinters, a bleeding man hugged a child after both were dug out of the rubble. A bakery in Deir al-Balah was flattened. In a nearby hospital, medics treated a boy with a mangled, half-severed leg. One worker lifted a dead baby out of the shattered concrete and rebar of 15 homes hit in the southern city of Rafah.
Japan has called on Israel to temporarily suspend fighting to allow humanitarian assistance to the besieged Gaza Strip, its foreign ministry said.The request was made in a meeting between Japan‘s State Minister for Foreign Affairs and Israel’s ambassador to Japan late on Wednesday to allow for humanitarian access to the enclave, according to a readout issued by the ministry on Thursday.Russia and China on Wednesday vetoed a U.S. push for the United Nations Security Council to act on the Israel-Hamas conflict by calling for pauses in fighting which has claimed thousands of lives. A Russian-drafted text that called for a ceasefire also failed.
AFP: There are roughly 2,500 American troops in Iraq and some 900 in Syria as part of efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group, which once held significant territory in both countries but was pushed back by local ground forces backed by international air strikes in a bloody multi-year conflict.
US forces and other personnel from the international coalition against the jihadists are deployed at bases in Iraq and Syria that have been the target of the attacks, but the facilities are ultimately controlled by local forces rather than international troops.
American troops in Iraq are playing a training and advisory role following the official end of the coalition’s combat mission in December 2021, while those in Syria conduct frequent raids against IS.
Back to the recent increase in attacks on US forces deployed in Iraq and Syria.
The impact of the attacks has been relatively limited so far, but the possibility of escalation is high, AFP reports.
The Pentagon said Wednesday that 21 US personnel “received minor injuries due to drone attacks” in Iraq and Syria last week, but that all of them returned to duty.
And a US civilian contractor suffered a “cardiac episode” and died while sheltering at a base in Iraq after early warning systems indicated a threat was approaching, according to the Pentagon, which said an attack ultimately did not occur in that case.
There is significant potential for the situation to worsen, especially in the event that a drone or rocket directly kills American personnel.
“What we are seeing is the prospect for more significant escalation against US forces and personnel across the region in the very near term coming from Iranian proxy forces, and ultimately from Iran,” the Pentagon said.
Reuters: Antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents including violent assaults and online harassment have spiked in the US since the Israel-Hamas conflict erupted on 7 October two advocacy groups said Wednesday.The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said it received 774 complaints of incidents motivated by Islamophobia and bias against Palestinians and Arabs from 7 October to Tuesday. The group said this was the highest level since 2015.The total was almost triple 2022’s average number of complaints for a period of the same duration.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said its preliminary data showed a 388% rise in antisemitic incidents in the US from 7 October to Monday over the prior year. The group reported 312 incidents including harassment, vandalism and assault. About 190 of those were directly linked to the war between Israel and Hamas, ADL said.CAIR cited an 18-year-old Palestinian man allegedly assaulted in Brooklyn; death threats against a mosque and a fatal stabbing of a 6-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois, who US authorities said was targeted for being Palestinian American.ADL said complaints included violent messages, especially on online platform Telegram, and rallies where “ADL found explicit or strong implicit support for Hamas and/or violence against Jews in Israel.”The US Justice Department has said it is monitoring rising threats against Jews and Muslims amid the conflict. President Joe Biden has condemned antisemitism and Islamophobia.
Here is our full story on Biden’s remarks earlier.
Biden has called for an immediate end to Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, as Israel kept up its strikes on Gaza in preparation for a long promised ground invasion.
Speaking at a joint press conference with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese, Biden said US support for Israel’s defense was ironclad, but added that the treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank by some Israelis was “pouring gasoline on the fire.”
“They’re attacking Palestinians in places that they’re entitled, and … it has to stop now,” the president said.
Biden accused Hamas of “hiding behind” Palestinian civilians in Gaza, but said Israel must follow the “laws of war,” in its strikes on the besieged enclave.
More than 6,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October, according to the Hamas run health ministry, and there are fears the toll could further soar if Israel pushes ahead with a widely expected ground invasion.
Biden however cast doubt on civilian casualty figures put forward by the Palestinians.
“I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s a price of waging war,” he said.
“But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.”
The Israeli military said late Wednesday that its aircraft struck at Lebanon in retaliation for the earlier launch of a surface-to-air missile.
“A short while ago, the IDF Aerial Defense Array intercepted a surface-to-air missile fired from Lebanon at an IDF UAV (drone),” the Israeli Defense Forces said in a statement.
“In response, IDF aircraft struck the source of the launch,” it added.
Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which has claimed many of the recent attacks on US forces in Iraq is not one of the established militant groups operating in the region and has not publicly claimed affiliation with or backing from a specific government, AFP reports.
But its claims of attacks on US forces have appeared in Telegram channels used by pro-Iranian armed factions, and the Pentagon has said the organizations “conducting these attacks are supported by the IRGC and the Iranian regime” – a reference to Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
The White House has meanwhile said Iran is “actively facilitating” attacks on US forces in the Middle East.
Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, told AFP the “Islamic Resistance in Iraq is a media claiming name, it’s not a group.”
It is the result of various existing Iran-backed groups in Iraq deciding “during the duration of this Gaza conflict to jointly claim all of their attacks,” he said.
American and allied forces deployed in Iraq and Syria as part of an international anti-jihadist coalition have been repeatedly targeted by drone and missile attacks this month, AFP reports.
Although the attacks have not been claimed by a known group with documented links to Iran, Washington says Tehran is involved and has threatened to respond “decisively” to strikes by its proxies.
The recent spike in attacks is linked to the latest war between Israel and Hamas.
Armed factions close to Iran have threatened to attack US interests over Washington’s support for Israel, with one of them – Ketaeb Hezbollah – demanding that American forces leave Iraq or “taste the fires of hell.”
The Pentagon said there were 10 attacks on American and allied forces in Iraq and three in Syria between 17 and 24 October, involving a “mix of one-way attack drones and rockets.”
Many - though not all - of the recent attacks have been claimed by the “Islamic Resistance in Iraq.”
Israeli airstrikes struck a bakery in the al Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza on Wednesday, killing 10 people, according to a statement released by the Gaza government press office. People could be seen sifting through rubble in a large crater as airstrikes continued across the besieged strip. Israel’s military said it had conducted airstrikes across Gaza on Wednesday, targeting Hamas infrastructure:

"‘It will be slow, very hard’: can Israel achieve its aims in Gaza invasion?",2023-10-27,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/27/can-israel-achieve-aims-gaza-invasion-palestine,"Divisions among Israeli leadership and US doubts are complicating what are already ‘fiendishly difficult’ objectives
The huge force that Israel has amassed along Gaza’s border over the past three weeks began to roll forward on Friday night, accompanied by a barrage of airstrikes and the pounding of artillery.
The Israel Defence Forces called it “an expansion” of ground operations, but a spokesperson for the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, went further, describing it as the beginning of the “turnaround” against Hamas.
“Hamas will feel our anger tonight,” the spokesperson, Mark Regev, told MSNBC.
It was not immediately clear whether Friday night’s incursions into Gaza marked the start of a major ground offensive, or its precursor, a ratcheting-up of presssure on Hamas. Whatever the tactical nature of the operation, the impact on Gaza’s population of 2.3 million will undoubtedly be to worsen the devastation wrought by the past three weeks of airstrikes.
Netanyahu has been cagey about the nature of the campaign in Gaza. He gave a speech on Wednesday night that sounded like a rallying cry for a ground assault, but it was carefully drafted, committing to nothing specific.
Whatever happens, Netanyahu – down in the polls and widely blamed for allowing the 7 October attack by Hamas – is making sure he does not take sole responsibility for whatever comes next.
“There is one group that supports a ground operation and one that is less enthusiastic,” said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat. “It’s not just the military versus Netanyahu. The division is within the war cabinet and within the military.”
There has been no shortage of reasons to delay the assault. Many in the security establishment, supported by the Biden administration, have wanted to give more time to efforts to extricate more than 200 hostages from Gaza.
The US also reportedly needed breathing space to bring in more munitions to defend its bases in the region in anticipation of a backlash from its enemies and their backers in Tehran. The IDF, meanwhile, is using the time to train reservists in urban warfare and top up their arsenal.
The plight of the 2.3 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza does not seem to have been a factor in the pause. Only a thin dribble of aid has been allowed in so far, the small relief convoys have brought no fuel to power hospitals or the water system, and the bombardment of Gaza, north and south, has been maintained.
The pause has given Israel time to reconsider its war aims and its ability to achieve them. The initial impetus to charge into Gaza was based on a desire for quick retribution and the generals’ quest for redemption in the eyes of the population after the appalling lapse of 7 October.
US military leaders were reportedly shocked at the vagueness of Israeli planning for the offensive, the blithe optimism about the urban warfare it faced, and the wishful thinking about Gaza’s long-term future post-Hamas.
“The Americans have their doubts,” Pinkas said. “And what they are questioning is the quality of Israeli decision-making. I think they are looking at gross incompetence on several levels here.”
The US was sufficiently concerned to send a Marine lieutenant general, James Glynn, and a team of urban warfare experts to sit alongside their counterparts.
It is an unprecedented melding of the US and Israeli militaries, with profound implications for both. It becomes much harder for Israel to act independently of the US – a calculated decision by Netanyahu, his critics say, to give him someone else to blame when things go wrong.
The Biden administration believes being inside the room will give it more of a restraining influence, but that has not been the case in Gaza and makes it impossible for the US to sidestep shared responsibility for the civilian death toll.
Meanwhile, Israel’s war aims have come into sharper focus. The military leadership realises that “destroying” Hamas – as an ideology and an affiliation – is impossible. In his speech on Wednesday, Netanyahu defined the goal as “destroying its military and governing abilities”. Those are two very different, and very difficult, goals, each with substantial complications.
“These two objectives cannot be achieved without the ground offensive,” said Shlomo Brom, a former general and director of IDF strategic planning. “So that’s why I believe that the government already decided on the ground campaign.”
While Hamas has ruled the entire Gaza Strip, the IDF believes the bulk of its military infrastructure – its “centre of gravity”, was how one general put it – is in the north.
That is why the Palestinian civilian population in northern Gaza, more than 1 million people, were ordered south of the Wadi Gaza River, which bisects the strip. The IDF plans to hold ground in the north long enough to destroy Hamas’s heavy weaponry and the tunnel network it has spent 16 years building. The southern half will not be spared bombing, as the people there have discovered, and the IDF is expected to mount “search and destroy” attacks aimed at Hamas members, civilian and military.
Holding the north will be hard enough. “It will be slow, very hard, and will require a great deal of preparation if we want to minimise our own casualties,” Brom said.
The Americans have come with cautionary tales from battles such as Falluja and Mosul in Iraq, or Raqqa in Syria, of how hard it is to fight in densely populated areas. In Gaza the military problems will be multiplied by Hamas’s extensive network of tunnels.
“It is hard to imagine a more challenging context for operations than Gaza City,” said David Petraeus, the US general who led US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and went on to become CIA director.
“Urban operations are always very difficult, but those in this case likely will be fiendishly so – with snipers, suicide bombers, 300 miles of tunnels, and improvised explosive devices, against terrorists who do not wear uniforms, know the area intimately, will use civilians and hostages as human shields, and have been preparing for this fight for months, if not years,” Petraeus said.
A report earlier this month by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a Washington thinktank, compared the coming fight to the battles for western Mosul and Raqqa in 2017.
An estimated 13,000 buildings were destroyed in west Mosul over 180 days of fighting and the capture of all of Mosul took 277 days, during which an estimated 9,000 civilians were killed. The authorities in Gaza say more than 7,000 Palestinians have died already, and the number is likely to increase rapidly as living conditions collapse and the ground offensive begins.
One option discussed between US and Israeli officers was a series of limited incursions targeting bits of Gaza at a time, on “search and destroy” missions. On the other end of the scale, some warn that the IDF will have to occupy the whole of the Gaza Strip for a time to do the job properly. Whatever option is chosen, Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said Israel has no intention of occupying the territory permanently.
Once Israeli forces enter Gaza, however, it may be hard for them to leave and still claim to have succeeded. That will depend on the ultimate political aims of the war, which appear to be the haziest part of the whole plan.
“Let’s assume that we invade Gaza and succeed in destroying most of the military capabilities of Hamas,” Brom said. “One thing that’s clear is that Israel doesn’t want to return to being the government in Gaza indefinitely. So it will wish to transfer the government to someone else. And there is a lot of thinking going on about who this will be.”
An Israeli general spoke hopefully in private of regional powers stepping in with investment to rebuild Gaza, and somehow overseeing a transition to a non-Hamas regime, possibly the Palestinian Authority.
It is hard to imagine who would send in peacekeeping troops after an Israeli invasion, and the authority is weak and discredited in the eyes of much of the population. It is highly unlikely that it would want to return to power in Gaza on the back of Israeli tanks.
For the Arab world, it could conceivably be a moment of leverage to demand a return to a real two-state solution.
That would involve the dismantling of settlements and the complete reversal of Netanyahu’s political project of destroying the two-state solution as a reality and as an idea. It was in pursuit of that project that Netanyahu, boosting the standing of Hamas in Gaza, sliced up the West Bank with settlements and gave radical settlers free rein to prey on the Palestinian inhabitants.
It is this project that has led Israel to its current security crisis. Finding a way out of it would involve a complete change of direction.
“There will be political implications as a result of the disastrous failure to government policies. So I hope that there will be political change,” Brom said.
There is little wonder in Israel, then, that Netanyahu has had his foot firmly, albeit surreptitiously, on the brakes. The logic of Israeli success requires him to relinquish power, while failure means a bloody morass in Gaza and perhaps the West Bank too, with the very real possibility that whatever comes next will be worse than what came before.
Nimrod Novik, who served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres when he was prime minister, said: “History tells us that when one extreme version disappears, the successor tends to be a lot more extreme and violent than the one it replaces.”

So how do we help them navigate the endless cycle of bad news?
 Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition
Good morning. With the cost of living crisis, political chaos, and two full-blown wars, the news cycle is possibly the bleakest it’s ever been. Waking up to more bad news every day is hard. It’s hard for you to read, and it’s hard for us to report on. But it’s hardest of all for the children – in Gaza, Israel and Ukraine, of course, but also those hearing about it from a distance and perhaps encountering the horrors of war for the first time.
In less than three weeks, it is thought that more than 2,360 children have been killed in Gaza, while more than 30 children were killed by Hamas during the attack in Israel and dozens have been taken hostage. Unicef described the “simply staggering” child death toll as “a growing stain on our collective conscience” as it called for an immediate ceasefire to stem the loss of young lives.
For today’s newsletter, I asked educational and child psychologist Prof Vivian Hill to talk about the impact that war has on still forming minds, and for her tips on how we should talk about the horrors of conflict with children. But first, the headlines.
Israel-Gaza | The US military has launched airstrikes on two locations in eastern Syria linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the Pentagon has said, amid growing fears that the war between Israel and Hamas could escalate into a regional conflict.
Maine shooting | A suspect in the killing of 18 people and wounding of 13 in two shootings in Maine was on the run on Thursday as authorities issued arrest warrants for multiple counts of murder.
Westminster | A senior Conservative MP, Crispin Blunt, has been arrested on suspicion of rape and possession of drugs. Blunt, who has since been suspended by the party, made a statement after Surrey police said a man in his 60s had been arrested on Wednesday and later released on bail.
Domestic violence | Wiltshire police force is reviewing thousands of applications made under Clare’s law, which gives people the right to ask whether a partner has a violent past, after it came to light that wrong or incomplete information had been given.

Almost half (47.3%) of the people living in Gaza are under 18, making it one of the youngest populations in the world. With so many children living in a war zone, it is perhaps not so surprising that many have been killed, but the numbers are still shocking. As well as the dead, 5,364 kids have been reported injured in the attacks – which Unicef works out as more than 400 children killed or injured every day since the conflict began on 7 October.
“The killing and maiming of children, abduction of children, attacks on hospitals and schools, and the denial of humanitarian access constitute grave violations of children’s rights,” Adele Khodr, Unicef’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said. “Unicef urgently appeals on all parties to agree to a ceasefire, allow humanitarian access and release all hostages. Even wars have rules. Civilians must be protected – children particularly – and all efforts must be made to spare them in all circumstances.”
Should you try to shield your children from the horror of war?
“It’s impossible to stop children from learning about the war,” Hill says. “They’re going to hear about it in the playground at school, or from their phones. Creating the right environment for them to ask questions they may have about the conflict is the most important thing.” That’s even more true for certain communities: some Jewish schools felt forced to shut their doors or tell children not to wear their uniforms in public, while Muslim children arriving at mosques for prayers have been met by police guarding the doors due to the “heightened risk” caused by the Israel-Gaza conflict.
Hill says many parents worry that learning about war is “denying children their innocence”, but she says there is never a good time for kids to learn that not everyone in the world is nice to each other. “It may well be earlier than you would have liked to broach the topic of war with your children, but take this as an opportunity to provide them with the right tools to deal with it – to build up resilience.”
As a parent or carer, Hill says, you are uniquely placed to know how much information your children require and how to talk to them depends on their age and development. The most important thing, she says, is to listen to the child and let them guide you in helping them.
“Some children will need reassurance that they are safe, while older children may need support to understand the complexities of the situation,” she says. “By taking the time to listen, and to help them process their own thoughts and emotions about the conflict, parents can provide comfort and help children cope with their difficult feelings.”
Ask your children how they feel
Hill, who has worked as a child psychologist for more than 20 years and now trains other people in child and educational psychology, says it is very important to put your own emotions to one side and let the child talk freely. “The news of war is distressing for all of us,” she says. “But it is important to be careful not to put your thoughts and worries into their heads.”
Take your time. There’s no need to rush into speaking to your children about it, Hill says. “It’s important to be clear of your own feelings, before you talk to them about it. Understand how you feel and process that, so you can be as neutral and calm as possible when you talk to them. You’ll then be in a better place to help your children process their feelings. If you’re worried you might get upset or worked up talking about it, hand it over to someone else you trust.”
Be careful about managing your distress. “If they see you’re anxious, worried or crying, they will take that onboard and worry as well.”
She suggests using open questions to explore their feelings. “Ask your children what they have heard and seen and how they are feeling, this allows them to introduce their personal perspectives and understandings first, so you can focus on their needs rather than your assumptions about how they might be feeling.”
Acknowledge the horror of war
As they grow up children inevitably develop their understanding of social injustice, inequalities and the horror of war. “This can make them feel upset, angry, frightened or unsafe, helping children learn how to process difficult information, feelings and emotions is a key role for parents and carers,” says Hill, who is a member of the British Psychological Society’s division of educational and child psychology.
She says it is important to regulate what news children are consuming, and points out that the news at 6pm uses less graphic images than the news at 10, for example. The BBC’s Newsround is the best child-friendly source of information, in her view.
“After seeing anything affecting, talk to your child about it, acknowledge the horror of it, but also don’t dwell on it.” She suggests doing something together with your child after seeing anything distressing. “Go out of for a walk, take the dog out, do something different.”
What to tell your children depends on how old they are
For younger children, only give them minimal details and in a manner they can understand. She suggests for anxious children that may worry what they’re seeing on the news could happen to them, “It might be helpful to look at a map together and see that it is happening a long way away, and not impacting people here.”
She says distance shouldn’t be used to minimise the importance of a conflict itself, but can have a big impact if children are concerned they could be at risk.
Hill says you might feel your children are too young to learn about war, but “they have a remarkable capacity to cope with feelings” and “[talking to them about conflict] may help to build their resilience for the future”.
“For adolescents they may have a more nuanced understanding of what’s happening,” says Hill, who is programme director of the UCL Institute of Education doctorate in child, adolescent and educational psychology. “In that case it can be helpful to do a little research together looking at the history of the conflict, and understand that both sides believe they have genuine cases.
“The most important thing is shifting the conversation towards the understanding of peace. Talking about the importance of ending wars, on keeping people safe, and promoting peaceful solutions, that will help your children feel reassured.”
Vivan, who has spent much of the past three weeks visiting schools to help teachers learn how to help their pupils deal with the impact of war, says she has been heartened by what she has heard unprompted in the playground.
“I heard somebody saying something unpleasant about a child whose family was linked to one side of the conflict,” she said. “Another child interrupted to say ‘It’s nothing to do with that person or their family, and they don’t get to choose what is happening, but what needs to happen is peace now’.
“It was a remarkably mature and well-researched position for a child of 14,” Hill says. “And it shows that young people can be a tremendous force for good. If we can all learn from that child and push that message that peace is the only way to solve this.”

Football | Jürgen Klopp’s prediction that Liverpool would not “fly” through the Europa League group stage amounts to their only mis-step so far. Qualification for the knockout phase is already close at hand with the procession continuing against Toulouse. Meanwhile Brighton gets its first European victory against ailing Ajax and Rangers played second fiddle to Sparta Prague for most of their Europa League game in the Czech Republic before leaving with a point in a goalless draw.
Cricket |England are on the brink of an early exit from the World Cup after an eight-wicket defeat by Sri Lanka.

A former tree of the year in Cubbington, Warwickshire that was felled to make way for HS2 is not dead; it has revived and is regrowing from its transplanted stump.
Thought to be 250 years old, the pear tree was demolished in 2020 by HS2 contractors, with its stump and root ball replanted in a location 100m from its original home. “We were very surprised and absolutely delighted,” said Rosemary Guiot, a resident of Cubbington village. Local residents say it is a testament to the area’s heavy clay soils, as most of the other young trees that were planted as part of the HS2 alleviation plan died due to recent dry conditions.

Israeli troops mount second ground raid into Gaza,2023-10-27,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/27/israeli-troops-mount-second-overnight-raid-into-gaza,"Troops attack targets in eastern Gaza City and pre-dawn bombardments reportedly kill dozens
Israeli troops backed by armoured vehicles and aircraft have mounted another ground raid into Gaza in advance of an expected invasion.
Infantry and engineering units struck targets overnight near the Shuja’iyya neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City under cover of air force helicopters, drones and jets, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said on Friday.
It followed a substantial but limited raid into a northern part of the coastal strip the previous night in an effort to scout Hamas positions and tunnel networks.
Fresh bombardments before dawn killed dozens, including children and a journalist, Yasser Abu Namous, the Palestinian Authority-run news agency Wafa reported.
Aid workers are preparing to send eight trucks with food, medicine and water into the territory. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said sporadic, limited deliveries were just “crumbs” when measured against the humanitarian needs of 2.4 million people.
“The current system in place is geared to fail,” he told a press conference in Jerusalem. “What is needed is meaningful and uninterrupted aid flow. And to succeed, we need a humanitarian ceasefire to ensure this aid reaches those in need.”
Lazzarini said 57 of the agency’s staff had been killed in the conflict. He issued a tacit rebuke to sceptics of casualty figures from the Hamas-run health ministry, which says more than 7,000 people have died in Gaza since 7 October. The commissioner said its figures in previous conflicts had been considered credible.
Satellite images provided by Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs show how the bombardment has reduced towns and cities to rubble, with rows of residential buildings erased.
Leaders of the 27 EU member states have unanimously called for “humanitarian corridors and pauses” of the bombing to allow food, water and medical supplies to enter the territory. More than 250 British lawyers, including professors of law, urged the UK government to press for a ceasefire, saying serious breaches of international law were being committed.
Fears of the crisis spreading across the region deepened on Friday after US warplanes bombed two locations in eastern Syria linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. The strikes hit weapons storage facilities and were a response to drone and missile attacks by Iranian-backed groups against US bases and personnel in Syria and Iraq, the Pentagon said.
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed four Palestinians in the latest in a series of raids that have killed scores and injured hundreds. Israeli officials said one of the four killed was Ayser Mohammad Al-Amer, a Palestinian Islamic Jihad field commander.
Israeli military officials raised the number of people held hostage in Gaza to 233, five more than the 228 cited a day earlier. Relatives of some hostages protested in Tel Aviv on Thursday against what they said was government inaction to free the hostages.
“They’ve been there for 20 days,” said Meirav Leshem-Gonen, whose 23-year-old daughter Romi was abducted, the Times of Israel reported. “Twenty days in which we’ve had no idea how they’re doing, how they’re being treated, if they’re OK, if they’re breathing.”
According to the Russian newspaper Kommersant, a member of a Hamas delegation in Moscow, Abu Hamid, said Hamas could not release hostages until a ceasefire was agreed.
Concern about the fate of the hostages has appeared to soften Israeli public support for a ground invasion of Gaza. Almost half of Israelis – 49% – wish to hold off, according to a poll by the newspaper Ma’ariv. It found that 29% of Israelis backed an immediate invasion, with 22% undecided. In a poll on 10 October – three days after the conflict began when Hamas militants entered southern Israel and killed more than 1,400 people – 65% backed a major ground offensive.
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Thursday night a full ground incursion would be launched soon. “We are responding with fire and creating the conditions for the ongoing war. There will also be other stages,” he told Kan radio. “We are preparing them, and we will carry them out. I am determined to deliver victory.”

Why did the US launch airstrikes on Syria and what happens next?,2023-10-27,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/27/what-prompted-us-air-strikes-syria-what-happens-next,"The war in Gaza risks developing into a wider conflict, but for now, the actions seem to be more about messaging between Washington and Tehran
Over the last 10 days, US military bases in eastern Syria and western Iraq have been hit by rockets and drones. There have been 22 such attacks, although details are sketchy and some may not have been counted. More than 20 US service personnel have been injured, though not seriously, and a civilian contractor died of cardiac arrest.
Earlier this week, Joe Biden promised a response if the attacks continued. On Thursday, there were more. This led to airstrikes, carried out by F-16 jets with precision munitions, on a warehouse and a bunker that reportedly contained weapons stored by the groups responsible. No casualties were reported.
Responsibility for the attacks has been claimed by the previously unknown Islamic Resistance of Iraq, which experts say is a new name invented to allow multiple extremist groups in Syria and Iraq to give the impression that a single, major organisation is behind them. This almost certainly is not true, and may hide the key role played by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
There is no direct evidence at present, or at least none in public, linking Iran to the attacks, but the various extremist groups that make up the so-called Islamic Resistance in Iraq are all known to have been founded, funded or otherwise assisted by Tehran. This does not mean they always follow Iranian orders, only that they are closely aligned.
As such, they are considered part of the “axis of resistance” established by Tehran as a chain of proxy groups across a swath of the Middle East from Yemen to the Mediterranean coast. The most powerful is Hezbollah in Lebanon, but the network also includes the Houthis in Yemen as well as Hamas in Gaza, whose terrorist attack on Israel on 7 October killed 1,400 people and sparked the war in Gaza.
The US has already moved two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean and deployed more military assets, especially anti-missile batteries, around the region with the aim of deterring Iran, which does not want to risk a costly all-out confrontation.
The US also wants to protect the approximately 900 US soldiers in Syria and 2,500 in Iraq who are there to reinforce the campaign against Islamic State (IS).
“These Iranian-backed attacks against US forces are unacceptable and must stop,” said the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, after the US strikes. “Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them. If attacks by Iran’s proxies against US forces continue, we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people.”
The prospect of massive use of US air power may also help to convince Tehran that a major Hezbollah offensive against Israel would be a bad idea.
This is the most direct use of force by the US since the crisis in the Middle East began almost three weeks ago. With the war in Gaza causing massive civilian casualties and an Israeli ground offensive looming, analysts say the region is a powder keg.
Nevertheless, the attacks of recent days and the US response are finely calibrated. This is more about messaging than actually trying to do harm. Experts say Iran is telling the US that it has the capability to hurt and embarrass Washington.
The US has made clear its own concerns, and that the “self-defence strikes … were intended solely to protect and defend US personnel in Iraq and Syria”. This sends the message: you back off and we’ll back off.
“We continue to urge all state and non-state entities not to take action that would escalate into a broader regional conflict,” Austin said.

Sarwar and Khan add to pressure on Starmer over Israel-Hamas ceasefire,2023-10-27,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/27/keir-starmer-under-pressure-to-call-for-ceasefire-between-israel-and-hamas,"Scottish Labour leader and mayor of London join calls to halt hostilities and allow aid to reach those in need
Keir Starmer is under growing pressure to call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after two of Labour’s most senior Muslim politicians said doing so was the best way to prevent further unnecessary deaths.
Anas Sarwar, the leader of Scottish Labour, said there should be an “immediate cessation of violence” with conditions attached. Hours earlier, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said a ceasefire was vital to avoid a “substantial military escalation”.
The interventions were not believed to be coordinated, but paved the way for other prominent Labour politicians to openly support the move for a de-escalation in Gaza.
Among others who put themselves at odds with the Labour leadership’s position on Friday were Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester.
Starmer has resisted calls from many Labour MPs – including several frontbenchers – to support a ceasefire.
Sarwar backed such a move with conditions, including an end to rocket exchanges and the release of all hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October.
“We need a proper peace process, because sadly right now there is no peace and there is no process. That’s the only way we can see a safe, secure and free Palestine, and a safe, secure and free Israel,” Sarwar said in a video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
He said withholding essential supplies such as food, water and medicine was a breach of international law, and added: “These are dark times.”
Earlier on Friday, Khan released a video saying he wanted to “join the international community in calling for a ceasefire”.
Calls to back a total ceasefire have been resisted by the UK government and the US, both of which instead support temporary pauses that are time- and location-specific to allow aid to reach those most in need. Labour has mirrored the Foreign Office’s approach, seeking to show cross-party alignment.
Khan said Israel had a right to defend itself, target those responsible for what he called the terror attack on 7 October and seek to free hostages, but added: “No nation, including Israel, has the right to break international law.”

Hundreds of Labour councillors and nearly a quarter of MPs, including two on the party’s frontbench, have supported a ceasefire.
Criticising Khan, Ian Austin, an independent peer who is the prime minister’s trade envoy to Israel, tweeted on Friday: “Sadiq Khan can’t stop kids killing each other on the streets of London, yet thinks he can provide useful advice on the most complicated and difficult conflict in the world.”
Although some Labour frontbenchers are said to have been on “resignation watch” since Starmer inflamed tempers with comments on LBC radio two weeks ago, party insiders suggested there may be no need for people to quit to speak out.
Khan and Sarwar’s interventions have given cover to frontbench MPs to make veiled criticisms of the party’s national policy, according to several sources.

Rushanara Ali, the shadow small business minister, said on Friday evening that there was a “grave danger of the war in Gaza spreading throughout the region” and called for countries to “support an immediate, internationally supported humanitarian ceasefire”.
The Labour leadership has sought to show that it is relaxed about the slew of politicians breaking ranks. Those around Starmer believe the considerations of Sarwar, Khan and Burnham differ from his. They stressed privately that Starmer would stick to the UK government’s position and maintain a more nuanced position instead of issuing “soundbites”.
However, unhappiness remains at senior levels within the parliamentary party.
One shadow cabinet source said: “They either need to change position or allow people to break ranks, otherwise at some point there will be resignations. The current situation is not sustainable: everyone wants to win, but some people believe they are in serious danger of losing their seat in the process.”
A Labour party spokesperson said: “We understand why people want to call for a ceasefire … The Palestinian people are not Hamas, and they are suffering terribly.”
The spokesperson reiterated Labour’s support for “humanitarian pauses” to allow aid, fuel, water, electricity and medicines to reach those in need.
They added that Israel had “a right and a duty to defend itself, rescue the hostages and stop Hamas from being able to carry out that sort of terrorist attack ever again”, so long as all action was taken within the confines of international law.
Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, explained on Friday why the government was resisting supporting a total ceasefire. She said the UK did not want to “cross that line of telling Israel it has anything but the right to defend itself”.
She went on: “Hamas have created this situation and Hamas are now embedding themselves in the Palestinian population.”

A recap on the situation in Gaza right now: Israel knocked out the internet and communications in the blockaded territory in a stepped-up bombardment during Friday night, largely cutting off its 2.3 million people from contact with each other and the outside world and creating a near-blackout of information, Associated Press reports.
The Israeli military said it was “expanding” ground operations in the territory, in an announcement signalling it was moving closer to an all-out invasion of Gaza.
Explosions from continuous airstrikes lit up the sky over Gaza City for hours after nightfall. The Palestinian telecom provider, Paltel, said the bombardment caused “complete disruption” of internet, cellular and landline services. The cutoff meant that casualties from strikes and details of ground incursions could not immediately be known. Some satellite phones continued to function.
Already plunged into darkness after most electricity was cut off weeks ago, Palestinians were thrown into isolation, huddling in homes and shelters with food and water supplies running out.
Relatives outside Gaza panicked after their messaging chats with families inside suddenly went dead and calls stopped going through.
“I was so scared this was going to happen,” said Wafaa Abdul Rahman, director of a feminist organisation based in the West Bank city of Ramallah. She said she hadn’t heard for hours from family in central Gaza.
This is where we’ll wrap up this blog and continue our rolling live coverage on a new blog here. Thanks for reading. Here’s a look at the latest as it just passes 8am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv.
Israel knocked out the internet and communications across the Gaza Strip during a stepped-up bombardment on Friday night, largely cutting off the blockaded territory’s 2.3 million people from contact with the outside world and creating a near-blackout of information.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Friday evening its air and ground forces were stepping up their operations in the Gaza Strip. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said aerial attacks had been targeting Hamas tunnels and other targets and warned residents of Gaza City to move south. A senior Israeli government adviser said Hamas “will feel our wrath tonight”. “Tonight we are starting payback,” Mark Regev said. “When this is over, Gaza will be very different.”
The IDF announcement came amid exceptionally heavy bombing of Gaza. After nightfall, frequent explosions from airstrikes lit up the sky over Gaza City. The Red Crescent, the World Health Organization, Médecins Sans Frontières, Unicef and other aid groups said they had lost all contact with their staff in Gaza.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees has cautioned that “many more will die” in Gaza from catastrophic shortages. “People in Gaza are dying, they are not only dying from bombs and strikes, soon many more will die from the consequences of [the] siege,” said Philippe Lazzarini, the agency chief.
Hamas said on Saturday its fighters in Gaza were ready to confront Israeli attacks with “full force” after Israel intensified its air and ground assaults. The Palestinian militant group said earlier that its fighters were clashing with Israeli troops in Gaza’s north-eastern town of Beit Hanoun and in the central area of Al-Bureij.
The US said it sought to degrade ammunition supplies of Iranian-linked militias with strikes in eastern Syria but insisted it did not want to widen the Middle East conflict. The strikes on two sites followed attacks by Iran-linked groups against US forces in Iraq and Syria. US president Joe Biden said later in a letter to House speaker Mike Johnson on Friday that the US “stands ready to take further action”.
The near-total telecommunications blackout in Gaza risks providing cover for mass atrocities, Human Rights Watch has said. A number of international agencies and NGOs said they had lost touch with their staff in Gaza on Friday, including the UN’s humanitarian agency, OCHA, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
The UN general assembly has overwhelmingly called for an “immediate, durable and sustainable humanitarian truce” between Israel and Hamas and demanded unhindered aid access to the besieged Gaza Strip. The motion drafted by Jordan is not binding but carries political weight, reflecting the degree to which the US and Israel are isolated internationally as Israel steps up its ground operations.
The Israeli military has accused Hamas of using hospitals in Gaza for military purposes and of turning them into “hideouts for Hamas terrorists and commanders”. While it is not possible to verify the precise details of the claims by the IDF, there is evidence that Hamas has in the past taken advantage of cover provided by civilian objects, including hospitals.
At least 7,326 Palestinians, including 3,038 children, have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said in its latest update on Friday. The claims have not been independently verified.
The UN has said it is concerned that war crimes are being committed on both sides of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. “We are concerned about the collective punishment of Gazans in response to the atrocious attacks by Hamas, which also amounted to war crimes,” a spokesperson for the UN human rights office, Ravina Shamdasani, said on Friday.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its medics had entered Gaza for the first time since the outbreak of war. Six medical staff passed through the Rafah border crossing on Friday, alongside four other ICRC specialists and six aid trucks carrying urgently needed medical material and water-purification supplies, an ICRC spokesperson said.
The Egyptian military reported that two drones fired from the southern Red Sea had landed in two resorts on the Sinai peninsula, one of them falling on Taba, which sits on the border with Israel. Six people were reported hurt in the incident, in a worrying sign of the conflict’s potential to spread.
EU leaders have unanimously called for humanitarian corridors and “pauses” in the Israel-Hamas war. An official declaration was to be issued after a two-day summit of leaders in Brussels that wrapped up on Friday.
Aid trucks trickle into Gaza while Israel steps up attacks and the UN’s general assembly calls for an immediate truce – here’s a rundown of what happened each day during week three of the war.
A fifth of bakeries supported by the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza have been bombed so far, as warnings have been issued of “catastrophic” food shortages due to a lack of fuel.
The UN Relief and Works Agency said 10 of the 50 bakeries it supplied with flour – helping to lower the soaring cost of bread – had been hit in airstrikes and fuel was running out for vehicles to transport flour to those that remained.
Bread has been desperately sought after, with long queues at bakeries, and has become the main food for many people in the shelters, which now house more than 600,000 people – triple their intended capacity.
The World Food Programme (WFP) said only two bakeries it had contracted had enough fuel to keep their ovens going and those that were operating were producing six times their capacity. The WFP had been supplying an average of 200,000 people a day with bread but that dropped to 150,000 on Wednesday, a spokesperson said.
Tens of thousands of people rely on small bakeries to find a loaf of bread to bring back to their families. People risk their lives and queue for hours, but they often go home empty-handed.

Joe Biden said in a letter to House speaker Mike Johnson on Friday that the US “stands ready to take further action” following attacks by Iran-linked groups against US forces in Iraq and Syria.
The US president’s comments in the letter, quoted by Reuters, came after US fighter jets carried out air strikes in eastern Syria on Friday.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has cautioned that “many more will die” in Gaza from catastrophic shortages.
“People in Gaza are dying, they are not only dying from bombs and strikes, soon many more will die from the consequences of [the] siege,” Philippe Lazzarini, the UNRWA chief, said.
Agence France-Presse also reports that the first tranche of critically needed aid was allowed in last weekend but only 74 trucks have crossed since then. The UN says an average of 500 trucks entered Gaza every day before the conflict.
Lazzarini said:
These few trucks are nothing more than crumbs that will not make a difference.
A first team of six medics from the International Committee of the Red Cross entered Gaza on Friday via its Rafah crossing with Egypt, along with six aid trucks, the Red Cross said.
Between the bombardments and the fuel shortages, 12 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals have been forced to close, and UNRWA said it has had to “significantly reduce its operations”.
Hamas said on Saturday its fighters in Gaza were ready to confront Israeli attacks with “full force” after Israel intensified its air and ground assaults, Reuters reports.
The Palestinian militant group said earlier that its fighters were clashing with Israeli troops in areas near the Israeli border.
Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised news briefing on Friday evening that its “ground forces are expanding their operations tonight”, raising the question of whether a long-anticipated ground invasion of Gaza might be starting. Israel’s air force was conducting extensive strikes on tunnels dug by Hamas and on other infrastructure, he said.
The armed wing of Hamas said late on Friday its fighters were clashing with Israeli troops in Gaza’s north-eastern town of Beit Hanoun and in the central area of Al-Bureij.
Hamas, which governs Gaza, said in a statement early on Saturday:
The Al-Qassam brigades and all the Palestinian resistance forces are completely ready to confront [Israel’s] aggression with full force and frustrate its incursions.
“Netanyahu and his defeated army will not be able to achieve any military victory,” Hamas said, referring to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
Al Jazeera, which was broadcasting live footage overnight showing frequent blasts in Gaza, said Israeli air strikes had hit areas around the enclave’s main hospital.
Reuters could not verify the reports of the strikes near Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. Israel’s military accused Hamas on Friday of using the hospital as a shield for its tunnels and operational centres, an allegation the group denied
Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has said he is praying his family survive the night of heavy bombardment in Gaza as they mark the end of a third week “trapped in this war zone” .
The Scottish National party leader said on social media he has been unable to contact his wife’s mother and her husband after communications were cut off, PA Media reports.
Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband, Maged, travelled to the region before the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October and have been caught since in the Israeli retaliation.
Yousaf said on X/Twitter:
How many more children have to die before the world says enough?
Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, recognised that Israel was “expanding their military campaign against Hamas” and said the UK’s “top priority remains the safety of British nationals in Gaza and the region”.
Cleverly tweeted:
We support Israel’s right to self defence, in line with IHL [international humanitarian law], and continue to push for the protection of Palestinian civilians.
Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to take to the streets of Britain on Saturday as Israel steps up its offensive on Gaza.
PA Media reports that police expect about 100,000 people to join a demonstration in London demanding a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, with other rallies organised elsewhere in the UK, including in Manchester and Glasgow.
About 200 British nationals remain in Gaza, the UK government says.
Metropolitan police said officers were expected to intervene if protesters use the word “jihad” in chants in London over the weekend.
A video emerged of a pro-Palestinian protester chanting “jihad” at one event last week, but officers had said no offences were identified in the footage from the demonstration.
The Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, differed with government ministers this week over how to police pro-Palestine protesters using the phrase.
The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, signalled that police were unlikely to be given more powers to address chants deemed to be extremist after the comments at last Saturday’s rally.
Here are some of the latest images of Gaza coming in via news agency wires as Israel intensified its bombardment overnight on Friday.
The near-total telecommunications blackout in Gaza amid Israel’s ongoing bombardment risks providing cover for mass atrocities, Human Rights Watch says.
The group said in a statement on Friday:
Widespread phone and internet outages occurred in Gaza on October 27, 2023, amid a concerted Israeli bombardment, almost entirely cutting off the 2.2 million residents from the outside world
Agence France-Presse also reported the NGO’s senior technology and human rights researcher, Deborah Brown, as saying:
This information blackout risks providing cover for mass atrocities and contributing to impunity for human rights violations.
A number of international agencies and NGOs said they had lost touch with their staff in Gaza on Friday, including the UN’s humanitarian agency, OCHA, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
Its humanitarian coordinator, Lynn Hastings, said in a statement that UN hospitals and humanitarian operations “can’t continue without communications”, alongside energy, food, water and medications.
The NGO Amnesty International said it had also lost contact with colleagues in Gaza, adding:
This communications blackout means that it will be even more difficult to obtain critical information and evidence about human rights violations and war crimes being committed against Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
Internet access and the phone network were completely cut across the Gaza Strip on Friday as Israel said it was expanding its military operation.
This video shows explosions flashing across the sky over Gaza overnight as Israel ramped up its aerial bombardment of the besieged territory.
The continuous explosions went for hours, but with communications cut off, the number of casualties and details of any ground incursions could not immediately be known.
Palestinians, aid groups, journalists and civil society organisations have said they have lost touch with staff and families in the Gaza Strip, after Israel knocked out the territory’s internet and communications.
NetBlocks, a watchdog organisation that monitors cybersecurity and the internet, reported a collapse in connectivity in Gaza late on Friday.
The Palestinian telecom provider, Paltel, said the bombardment caused “complete disruption” of internet, cellular and landline services.
Shortly after reports of lost service, exceptionally heavy bombardment was heard in the territory and the Israel Defense Forces said their air and ground forces were intensifying their attacks in Gaza.
Already in darkness after most electricity was cut off and fuel for generators ran out, Gaza’s 2.3 million people were thrown into isolation from the rest of the world.
See the full story from Hibaq Farah and agencies here:
Demonstrations have been held in New York City’s Grand Central Station calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.
NYPD reportedly made arrests at the scene on Friday evening.
A recap on the situation in Gaza right now: Israel knocked out the internet and communications in the blockaded territory in a stepped-up bombardment during Friday night, largely cutting off its 2.3 million people from contact with each other and the outside world and creating a near-blackout of information, Associated Press reports.
The Israeli military said it was “expanding” ground operations in the territory, in an announcement signalling it was moving closer to an all-out invasion of Gaza.
Explosions from continuous airstrikes lit up the sky over Gaza City for hours after nightfall. The Palestinian telecom provider, Paltel, said the bombardment caused “complete disruption” of internet, cellular and landline services. The cutoff meant that casualties from strikes and details of ground incursions could not immediately be known. Some satellite phones continued to function.
Already plunged into darkness after most electricity was cut off weeks ago, Palestinians were thrown into isolation, huddling in homes and shelters with food and water supplies running out.
Relatives outside Gaza panicked after their messaging chats with families inside suddenly went dead and calls stopped going through.
“I was so scared this was going to happen,” said Wafaa Abdul Rahman, director of a feminist organisation based in the West Bank city of Ramallah. She said she hadn’t heard for hours from family in central Gaza.
Before the White House’s latest comments on its strikes on Syrian sites it said were used by Iranian-linked militias, it said Joe Biden had relayed a direct warning to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, against militias striking US troops in Syria and Iraq.
The US forces are stationed as part of efforts against the Islamic State group, which also has clashed with Iran, Agence France-Presse reports.
There have been at least 14 attacks on US and allied forces in Iraq and six in Syria since 17 October, a period in which 21 US military personnel suffered minor injuries and one contractor died from a cardiac incident, according to the Pentagon.
The US strikes on Thursday were the first on Iranian interests since March, breaking a stretch of calm after the Biden administration opened quiet diplomacy with the US arch-enemy that led to a prisoner swap and conversations on Iran’s disputed nuclear program.
The defense secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes were “narrowly tailored” to protect US personnel and were “separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas”.
The Pentagon said on Friday evening that its current assessment was the strikes did not cause casualties.
The United States has said it sought to degrade ammunition supplies of Iranian-linked militias with strikes in Syria but insisted it did not want to widen the Middle East conflict.
Agence France-Presse reports that the Pentagon on Thursday announced air strikes on two sites in eastern Syria it said were used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after a string of attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.
John Kirby, the US national security council spokesman, told reporters on Friday:
The purpose for those two sites that we targeted was to have a significant impact on future IRGC and Iran-backed militia group operations
It went right at storage facilities and ammo depots that we know will be used to support the work of these militia groups, particularly in Syria.
The main goal was to disrupt that ability and also to deter – to prevent – future attacks.
This is Adam Fulton picking up our rolling live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. It’s now approaching 2.30am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv
If you’re just joining us, here’s where we stand:
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have announced its air and ground forces are stepping up their operations in the Gaza Strip. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said aerial attacks had been targeting Hamas tunnels and other targets, and warned residents of Gaza City to move south, where there will be “better conditions”.
Hamas’s military wing said it was confronting Israeli forces in the areas of Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza and Bureij in the centre of the territory – both entry points that have been used by IDF forces in previous conflicts. “Violent engagements” are taking place on the ground, the al-Qassam brigades said.
The Israeli military’s announcement came amid exceptionally heavy bombing and a communications blackout across the Gaza Strip. After nightfall, frequent explosions from airstrikes lit up the sky over Gaza City. The Red Crescent, the World Health Organization, Médecins Sans Frontières, Unicef and other aid groups said they had lost all contact with their staff in Gaza.
A senior Israeli government adviser has said Hamas “will feel our wrath tonight”. “Tonight we are starting payback,” Mark Regev said. “When this is over, Gaza will be very different.” Israel is “beefing up the pressure” on Hamas and that pressure will continue to increase until it has achieved its goal, he said.
The UN general assembly has overwhelmingly called for an “immediate, durable and sustainable humanitarian truce” between Israel and Hamas and demanded unhindered aid access to the besieged Gaza Strip. The motion drafted by Jordan is not binding, but carries political weight, reflecting the degree to which the US and Israel are isolated internationally as Israel steps up its ground operations.
The Israeli military has accused Hamas of using hospitals in Gaza for military purposes and of turning them into “hideouts for Hamas terrorists and commanders”. While it is not possible to verify the precise details of the claims by the IDF, there is evidence that Hamas has in the past taken advantage of cover provided by civilian objects, including hospitals.
At least 7,326 Palestinians, including 3,038 children, have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the health ministry in Gaza said in its latest update on Friday. The claims have not been independently verified.
“Many more will die” as a result of Israel’s siege of the Gaza Strip, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees has said. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) chief, Philippe Lazzarini, warned at a news conference on Friday that basic services in Gaza are “crumbling”, with medicine, food and water running out.
The UN has said it is concerned that war crimes are being committed on both sides of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. “We are concerned about the collective punishment of Gazans in response to the atrocious attacks by Hamas, which also amounted to war crimes,” a spokesperson for the UN human rights office, Ravina Shamdasani, said on Friday.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its medics had entered Gaza for the first time since the outbreak of war. Six medical staff passed through the Rafah border crossing on Friday, alongside four other ICRC specialists and six aid trucks carrying urgently needed medical material and water-purification supplies, an ICRC spokesperson said.
The Egyptian military reported that two drones fired from the southern Red Sea had landed in two resorts on the Sinai peninsula, one of them falling on Taba, which sits on the border with Israel. Six people were reported hurt in the incident, in a worrying sign of the conflict’s potential to spread.
US fighter jets launched airstrikes early on Friday on two locations in eastern Syria linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Pentagon said, in retaliation for a slew of drone and missile attacks against US bases and personnel in the region that began early last week.
EU leaders have unanimously called for humanitarian corridors and “pauses” in the Israel-Hamas war. An official declaration will be issued after a two-day summit of leaders in Brussels that wrapped up on Friday.
Antisemitic and Islamaphobic incidents have almost doubled in just over a week in London, according to police data on Friday.

Israeli forces have struck targets in Syria and Lebanon, the country’s defence force has said. In separate tweets, the IDF said an aircraft had attacked Hezbollah targets in Lebanese territory, including “infrastructures for directing terrorism and military infrastructures of the organisation”, and that a fighter jet had attacked launchers in Syrian territory. It said both attacks were in response to launches from those areas into Israel.

This liveblog is closing – you can continue to follow live coverage on a new liveblog here. Thank you for reading.
All living former prime ministers of Australia, except Paul Keating, have co-signed a statement regarding the Israel-Hamas war.
The statement condemns the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel, calls for the unconditional release of hostages taken by Hamas, and for sustained humanitarian access for Palestinians.
On the battlefield in Israel and Gaza we do not presume to give strategic advice to Israel. But the legitimate objective of defeating Hamas must be accompanied by support and protection for the civilian population of Gaza. Israel promises it will do all it can to avoid civilian casualties, we urge it to do so with all of its humanity and skill.
The former prime ministers also endorse a two-state solution “as the basis for long-term lasting peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples”.
The statement concludes:
At this time, more than ever, we must, in the words of the 34th Psalm ‘seek peace and pursue it’. And here at home that is done by defending our Australian values, condemning hate speech and intolerance and respecting the people of Australia in all our diversity.
It is signed by John Howard, Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison. In a statement yesterday, Keating said he was contacted by Mark Leibler proposing the joint statement and asking for his agreement and signature.
I told Leibler in a written message that I would not be agreeing to join other former prime ministers in authorising the statement.
That remains my position.
Leibler is the former president of the Zionist Federation of Australia and current chairman of the Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council.
Another 33 aid trucks were allowed to pass into Gaza from Egypt on Sunday, according to a spokesperson at the Rafah crossing, Wael Abo Omar. It is the largest number of aid trucks to cross in a day since the conflict began, but humanitarian workers have told the Associated Press that the assistance still falls desperately short of what’s needed, as only a fraction of the aid that used to cross prior has gotten through.
On Sunday thousands of Gaza residents broke into UN warehouses to take food and other essentials, in what the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency said was a sign people had reached “breaking point”.
The Palestinian Red Crescent agency earlier said 24 trucks had been allowed to pass, bringing the total number to 118.
After visiting the Rafah crossing, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court called the suffering of civilians “profound” and said he had not been able to enter Gaza. “These are the most tragic of days,” said Karim Khan, whose court has been investigating the actions of Israeli and Palestinian authorities since 2014.
Palestinians in northern Gaza have reported fierce air and artillery strikes in the last few hours.
Palestinian media reported Israeli air strikes had hit areas near Gaza City’s Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals, and that Palestinian militants and Israeli forces had fought in southern border areas east of Khan Younis. The Palestinian Red Crescent said on Sunday that it had received warnings from Israeli authorities to immediately evacuate al-Quds hospital, where some 14,000 people have sought shelter. The Guardian has not independently verified the reports, and there has been no comment from Hamas or the Israeli military.
On Sunday evening the IDF had delivered a briefing saying its ground operation was continuing and intensifying. The spokesman also said its call for Gaza residents to evacuate to the south – ahead of military targeting of the north - was now “a matter of urgency”.
Israel also released photos of tanks on Gaza’s west coast, which Reuters reported as a signal of a potential effort to surround Gaza’s main city.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has released preliminary findings of its investigation into the death of its journalist Issam Abdallah on 13 October, saying they believe he was killed by a “targeted strike” from the direction of the Israeli border.
“According to the ballistic analysis carried out by RSF, the shots came from the east of where the journalists were standing; from the direction of the Israeli border,” RSF said.
“Two strikes in the same place in such a short space of time (just over 30 seconds), from the same direction, clearly indicate precise targeting.”
The RSF report did not conclude who had launched the strike against the journalists or provide its underlying analysis.
The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters on the RSF’s findings. It has said it does not deliberately target journalists and that it is investigating the 13 October incident.
In a statement, Reuters said: “We are reviewing the preliminary conclusion reached by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which found that Issam Abdallah and other journalists in Alma el-Chaab appear to have been deliberately fired upon from the direction of Israel on 13 October.
“We reiterate our call to the Israeli authorities to conduct a swift, thorough and transparent probe into what happened. And we call upon all other authorities with information about the incident to provide it. We will continue to fight for the rights of all journalists to report the news in the public interest free of harassment or harm, wherever they are.”

Local health authorities in Dagestan have now said about 20 people were injured after hundreds of anti-Israel protesters stormed the airport in Makhachkala. The authorities said two of the injured are in a critical condition, Reuters has reported.
Israeli forces have struck targets in Syria and Lebanon, the country’s defence force has said. In separate tweets, the IDF said an aircraft had attacked Hezbollah targets in Lebanese territory, including “infrastructures for directing terrorism and military infrastructures of the organisation”, and that a fighter jet had attacked launchers in Syrian territory. It said both attacks were in response to launches from those areas into Israel.

In the UK, five people have been charged in relation to protests in Central London on Saturday. Tens of thousands of people marched on Saturday, calling for a ceasefire, and protesting against the UK government’s refusal to back one.
Metropolitan Police said 11 people were arrested – nine on the day and another two on Sunday morning. Five have now been charged, including two people for racially aggravated public order offences, two for public order offences, and one for causing actual bodily harm after allegedly assaulting a police officer.
Here is where the day stands:
International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan said that the ICC has “active investigations ongoing” into alleged war crimes in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. The prosecutor added: “There should not be any impediment to humanitarian relief supplies going to … civilians.”
Jordan has asked the US to deploy Patriot air defense systems to bolder its border defense amid increased regional tensions, Reuters reports a Jordanian army spokesperson saying on Sunday. “We asked the American side to help bolster our defence system with Patriot air defence missile systems,” Brigadier General Mustafa Hiyari, Jordan’s army spokesperson, told state television.
The International Committee of the Red Cross has announced that three more aid trucks crossed into Gaza on Sunday. The trucks come as an addition to the six trucks and war surgery team that were sent into Gaza on Friday, the ICRC said.
Israel has summoned the Russian ambassador to lodge a protest at Moscow’s hosting last week of a delegation from Hamas following its 7 October attacks against Israel. Inviting Hamas “sends a message legitimising terrorism against Israelis”, Israel’s foreign ministry said in a statement, quoting its senior staff as telling ambassador Anatoly Viktorov, Reuters reports.
Russian authorities closed an airport in the city of Makhachkala in the northern Caucasus region and diverted flights, including one from Israel, after media reports showed demonstrators denouncing Israeli actions in Gaza had gathered at the facility, Reuters reports. The authorities said the airport would remain closed pending “normalisation” of the situation. Russia’s Investigative Committee ordered a criminal probe into the incident, Reuters added.
Joe Biden spoke by phone with Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday morning, the White House said. “The president reiterated that Israel has every right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism and underscored the need to do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law that prioritizes the protection of civilians,” the White House said in a press statement.
Joe Biden also spoke with Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the White House said. “President Biden and President Sisi affirmed their commitment to work together to set the conditions for a durable and sustainable peace in the Middle East to include the establishment of a Palestinian state,” it said.
Thousands of Gaza residents broke into UN warehouses on Sunday, grabbing flour and other essential items in a sign they had reached “breaking point”, said the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), Reuters reports. “This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege on Gaza,” UNRWA said in a statement.
“We are going to move a standalone Israeli funding bill,” the US’s new House speaker Mike Johnson said in an interview on Fox News. In a response to a question on separating Israeli aid from Ukrainian aid, Johnson said: “Our Republican colleagues in the Senate have a similar measure. We believe that that is a pressing and urgent need.”
Médecins Sans Frontières has sent 26 tons of medical supplies on a World Health Organization plane to Egypt. “The medical supplies can cover the needs for 800 surgical interventions and are destined for healthcare facilities in Gaza in collaboration with the local health authorities,” MSF said.
The number of children killed in Gaza in last three weeks surpassed annual number of children killed in war zones since 2019, Save the Children said on Sunday. “With a further 1,000 children reported missing in Gaza assumed buried under the rubble, the death toll is likely much higher,” it added.
Faculty from New York City’s Columbia University and Barnard College have signed an open letter in support of their students expressing solidarity with Palestine, noting that such expressions of solidarity and the historical contextualization of the ongoing war is not antisemitic. “One could regard the events of October 7th as just one salvo in an ongoing war between an occupying state and the people it occupies, or as an occupied people exercising a right to resist violent and illegal occupation,” the letter said.
Jordan has asked the US to deploy Patriot air defense systems to bolster its border defense amid increased regional tensions, Reuters reports a Jordanian army spokesperson saying on Sunday.
“We asked the American side to help bolster our defence system with Patriot air defence missile systems,” Brigadier General Mustafa Hiyari, Jordan’s army spokesperson, told state television.
The International Committee of the Red Cross has announced that three more aid trucks crossed into Gaza on Sunday.
The trucks come as an addition to the six trucks and war surgery team that were sent into Gaza on Friday, the ICRC said, adding that it stands ready to deliver more aid to address the “huge needs” in Gaza.
📢 3 more trucks crossed into #Gaza today - in addition to the 6 trucks & war surgery team Friday.

Israel has summoned the Russian ambassador to lodge a protest at Moscow’s hosting last week of a delegation from Hamas following its October 7 attacks against Israel. 
Inviting Hamas “sends a message legitimising terrorism against Israelis,” Israel’s foreign ministry said in a statement, quoting its senior staff as telling ambassador Anatoly Viktorov, Reuters reports.
The ministry described the summons as a protest rather than a reprimand.
Russia had described its hosting of Hamas as an attempt to maintain contacts across all sides of the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict.
On Saturday, Hamas said that it is trying to locate eight Russian-Israeli dual citizens who are among the more than 200 hostages captured during its 7 October attacks against Israel.
“We are looking for those people ... It is hard but we are looking. And when we find them, we will let them go … We are very attentive to this list and will process it carefully because we consider Russia to be a close friend,” senior Hamas representative Moussa Abu Marzook said, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.
Russian authorities closed an airport in the city of Makhachkala in the northern Caucasus region and diverted flights, including one from Israel, after media reports showed demonstrators denouncing Israeli actions in Gaza had gathered at the facility.
Reuters reports:
The Russian aviation authority Rosaviatsia said security forces had by 10:20 p.m. Moscow time (1920 GMT) removed the group from Makhchkala airport in Dagestan – one of several areas in the north Caucasus region that is home to large Muslim communities.
The authority said the airport would remain closed pending “normalisation” of the situation. Russia’s Investigative Committee ordered a criminal probe into the incident.
Israel urged Russian authorities to protect Israelis and Jews in their jurisdictions following the reports.
A statement by the foreign ministry in Jerusalem said the Israeli ambassador in Moscow was working with Russian authorities. “The state of Israel views gravely attempts to harm Israelis citizens and Jews anywhere,” the statement said.
Here are some images coming through the newswires of Gaza, where the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli strikes have surpassed 8,000, the Gaza health ministry reports:
Angelina Jolie has spoken out about the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, as well as the ongoing humanitarian crisis currently faced by thousands of Gazans as a result of Israel’s deadly strikes and seige across the strip.
In a statement on Instagram, the former UN special envoy said:
What happened in Israel is an act of terror. But that cannot justify the innocent lives lost in bombing a civilian population in Gaza that has nowhere to go, no access to food or water, no possibility of evacuation, and not even the basic human right to cross a border to see refuge …
The denial of aid, fuel and water is collectively punishing a people. Humanity demands an immediate ceasefire. Palestinian and Israeli lives – and the lives of all people globally – matter equally.
She added that she has donated to medical relief efforts and that she has “chosen to support the work of Doctors Without Borders”.
US secretary of state Antony Blinken said that he spoke with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan to discuss the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas and the need for humanitarian aid into Gaza.
In a tweet posted on Sunday, Blinken said:
I spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister @HakanFidan to discuss our efforts to prevent the spread of the Gaza conflict further into the region, secure the release of hostages, and mobilize humanitarian aid. We also discussed ratification of Sweden’s accession to NATO.
Blinken’s call follows Israel’s announcement on Saturday that it was recalling its diplomats due to “increasingly harsh statements” coming out of Ankara.
Earlier Saturday, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during a pro-Palestinian protest that Israel is “an occupier”.
Hundreds of people on Sunday stormed into the main airport in Makhachkala, Russia’s Dagestan region, to protest the arrival of a flight from Tel Aviv, Russian news agencies and social media said.
The Associated Press reports:
Authorities closed the airport in Makhachkala, capital of the predominantly Muslim region, and police converged on the facility.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests.
Russian news reports said people in the crowd were shouting antisemitic slogans and tried to storm the airliner belonging to Russian carrier Red Wings that had landed from Tel Aviv.
Video on social media showed some in the crowd on the landing field waving Palestinian flags.
In a statement released Sunday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel “expects the Russian law enforcement authorities to protect the safety of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they may be and to act resolutely against the rioters and against the wild incitement directed against Jews and Israelis.” Netanyahu’s office added that the Israeli ambassador to Russia was working with Russia to keep Israelis and Jews safe.

Tree image leads to calls for logging overhaul
A photo of a centuries-old tree on the back of a truck being driven through the centre of Hobart has prompted fresh calls for laws to be changed to protect Tasmania’s native forests from logging.
The image of the logging truck on Macquarie Street, the city’s main south-north thoroughfare, was posted online by the Bob Brown Foundation, an environment group. It is the latest in a series of pictures of large trees being hauled on the state’s roads in recent months.
Protesters have blocked logging in an area near Kermandie, south of Hobart, that scientists say has large trees that could be used for nesting by the critically endangered swift parrot, a migratory species that breeds in Tasmania.

Most Australians in Gaza want to flee, assistant minister says
Matt Thistlethwaite, the assistant minister for defence, has provided a brief update on 88 Australians who remain in Gaza, with many of them seeking to leave. He told Sky News:
There are 88 Australians that are left in Gaza. Many of them are seeking to return to Australia and the government is working as closely as we possibly can with the Israeli government to hopefully allow that to occur.
That’s why you’ve seen in the last week the foreign minister, Penny Wong, call for a humanitarian pause on the actions of the Israeli military to allow important humanitarian supplies food, water, fuel, sanitation products to get to those in need, but also to allow those that want to leave, particularly to come south and escape the combat zone, to do so as quickly as possible.
We’ve been trying to do that through a leeway, through Rafah. We’ll continue to try to do that. But that’s why I think it was important that the prime minister reiterated that we do want humanitarian law upheld here and that humanitarian pause to take place to allow those Australians and indeed other internationals that want to leave the area to get out if they can.
NSW police dump youth crime strategy
The New South Wales police force has rushed to dump a decades-old policy on “highly intrusive” proactive policing of children after a watchdog warned the strategy was potentially unlawful.
The move comes after a five-year investigation by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (LECC), which found the NSW police’s use of the suspect targeting management plan (STMP) was having an “ongoing discriminatory effect” on young people.
After seeing a draft of the LECC’s scathing report – the final version of which was released on Monday – the police force said it had stopped using the scheme for people under 18 last week.

Even ‘best’ police may not be able to de-escalate some mental health crises, union says
The head of the New South Wales police union has warned there may be some mental health crises which are so severe that even the “best” officers won’t be able to de-escalate them.
The NSW Police Association president, Kevin Morton, gave evidence to the state’s parliamentary inquiry into mental health outpatient services on Monday, when he repeated his calls for health professionals to lead mental health responses.
Morton said:
Unfortunately when we get to mental health incidents, the mere fact that we are there in uniform with a person that is seriously and critically having a mental health episode ... just exacerbates the situation.
And no amount of communication skills, even for the best of officers, may not be able to de-escalate that.
The police union’s manager, Tony Bear, also giving evidence at Monday’s hearing, said officers were worried about criticism including from the state coroner and that they had been used as a “punching bag”.
He said:
When there’s a violent incident, police will be called.
And I think that sometimes in this place we see police used as a bit of a punching bag for incidents that will never stop being police incidents.
The parliamentary inquiry comes with the police use of force in the spotlight, after four vulnerable people were fatally wounded or shot by officers in as many months, leading to calls for a royal commission from affected families.

Services Australia pauses repayments on thousands of Centrelink debts
Services Australia has paused repayments on thousands of potentially unlawful welfare debts but has warned income support recipients it’s too early to say if their debts will be waived.
In August the commonwealth ombudsman revealed that up to 100,000 debts or potential debts were incorrectly calculated over two decades by “unlawfully apportioning” welfare recipients’ income.
Services Australia responded by pausing the process of raising new debts for affected income earned before December 2020, but has now gone a step further by pausing repayments of those it has already claimed owed it money.

Students return to St Andrew’s Cathedral school after coach’s death
Overwhelming the courtyard at St Andrew’s Cathedral school on Monday was a sombre mood and the smell of pollen.
It was the first day of students returning to the Sydney private school grounds since the body of the 21-year-old water polo coach Lilie James was found in the gym bathroom about midnight last Wednesday.
They walked into the school with arms full of bright bouquets to lay at the front door in memory of James. Alongside them, teachers and parents held each other in long embraces.

Extreme fire conditions have been forecast for parts of Queensland tomorrow, with strong westerly winds and hot temperatures accelerating bushfires across the state.
An emergency warning was issued on Monday afternoon for residents along Lucky Road in Tara, west of Brisbane, who have been told to leave immediately.
Up to 44 homes have already been lost in the fires in Queensland’s Western Downs region. Two people have died, including a woman who suffered a cardiac arrest while evacuating her home.
The Rural Fire Service superintendent, John Welke, told reporters on Monday that fire crews had taken advantage of cooler weather over the weekend but conditions would deteriorate on Tuesday.
“Unfortunately we do see some severe deterioration in the weather tomorrow. I would actually say extreme fire danger ... for the Darling Downs tomorrow ... affected by those strong westerly winds ... in the vicinity of 30km [an hour] and quite a warm day.”
Welke urged Queenslanders to follow the fire bans in place for most of the state and reconsider performing outside activities such as welding.
“We implore people to be very conscious that our crews are very tired ... There is a tremendous resourcing drain but ... there’s been tremendous goodwill ... We are going to see some improvement support [of additional crews] starting to flow in later this week from Victoria.”
Cancer Council says four ‘loopholes’ in tobacco bill must be closed
Cancer Council Australia’s chief executive officer, Prof Tanya Buchanan, and the organisation’s chief policy officer, Dr Michelle Scollo, have told the public hearing into amendments to the Tobacco and Other Products Bill that there are four “loopholes” in the bill that need to be closed.
“If there are loopholes in a piece of legislation, we can be sure that they do get exploited,” Scollo said.
The Cancer Council said the legislation prohibits individuals from entering into sponsorships with the tobacco and vaping industries, but they want the legislation to make it explicit that organisations and corporations are also prohibited.
The Cancer Council is also concerned about wording that bans certain flavours from products, such as menthol. They do not want the industry to try to improve the palatability of products by adding ingredients that aren’t strictly considered “flavours”.
Scollo said she also wants tobacco trade publications barred from including anything that promotes smoking or vaping to retailers when highlighting available products.
The public hearing into the bill is expected to hear from retail and tobacco industry representatives tomorrow.
The chief of the New South Wales anti-corruption watchdog has praised the investigation into Gladys Berejiklian and Daryl Maguire for sending “a clear message to all public officials” as the former premier prepares a legal challenge against its findings.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption chief commissioner, John Hatzistergos, singled out the investigation into Berejiklian and her ex-boyfriend Maguire in Icac’s annual report, released on Monday.
The publication of the annual report comes six weeks after Berejiklian launched legal action against Icac’s finding that she had engaged in serious corrupt conduct in relation to her secret relationship with the then Wagga Wagga MP.
It also follows a separate review by the independent Icac inspector of the way the watchdog handled the Operation Keppel inquiry into Maguire and Berejiklian, which concluded there was no maladministration and the time taken to release the report was reasonable.
However, the inspector, Gail Furness, did say Icac could not expect to meet future key performance indicators if it continued to work in the same way.
The Icac annual report reveals the watchdog narrowly missed its target of completing 70% of its full-length investigations within 16 months, completing 66% within this time frame.
Hatzistergos said the commission achieved its best KPI result for investigation timeliness in five years.
The Icac annual report also revealed that Hatzistergos was paid $796,128 in the past financial year.
Milk recalled over potential E coli contamination
Consumers are being warned not to drink a batch of milk from Tempo Foods after it was found to have a potential E coli contamination.
The milk, which was recalled on Friday, had been available at Coles, Woolworths and independent supermarkets in New South Wales and Victoria.
The NSW Food Authority warned consumers not to consume the Tempo Foods Full Cream 2L product and the Light 2.5% 2L product with a use-by date of 31 October and 2 November. The company’s Skim 0% 2L product with a use-by date of 31 October should also not be consumed.
People with asthma in west and south Gippsland are at a high risk of epidemic thunderstorm asthma today, Victoria’s acting chief health officer, Christian McGrath, is warning.
The combination of high grass pollen levels and predicted thunderstorms with strong winds mean they may develop asthma symptoms over a short period of time.
The health department advises people with asthma to protect themselves by:
Monitoring the epidemic thunderstorm asthma risk forecast on the VicEmergency app.
Avoid being outdoors in a storm, especially in the winds that come before the storm.
Take preventative medication as directed, even when symptom-free.
Carry a reliever and know how to manage an asthma attack. Follow an asthma action plan or use asthma first aid.
Licensing would help combat small tobacco black market, expert says
The tobacco control expert and professor of public health Becky Freeman has told the public hearing into the Tobacco Amendments Bill that 90% of tobacco consumption in Australia is not illicit consumption, but legal consumption.
The proposed changes to the bill include updated graphic warnings on packaging, and cracking down on additives that make the products more appealing. The public health experts speaking to the bill are being pressed by Senator Maria Kovacic about whether the changes will increase illicit tobacco use.
Freeman responds that:
Anytime we’ve proposed any reform in tobacco control, the industry will say it causes a black market or that changes inflate the black market.
This is just rhetoric for them, and you will see news stories start to increase around this when you are debating reforms. You’ll see experts come out of the woodwork who all of a sudden know everything about the black market that you’ve never heard of before.
In Australia, we actually have a really straightforward way to combat the black market, which though obviously is a small problem, is not one that we should ignore. But it’s about enforcement and monitoring. It’s about licensing manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers.
Our two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, do not have appropriate licensing systems for such a dangerous product. If we had better controls on knowing where products were stored, where they were sold, and who they were imported to, we could track where all tobacco products are going.
Labor withdraws controversial casual work provision in IR bill
The Albanese government has withdrawn one of the most controversial provisions of its closing loopholes industrial relations bill.
The bill contains a new section 359A of the Fair Work Act, creating a civil penalty provision for employers who misrepresent that a job is casual.
On Monday the Australian Hotels Association announced and Guardian Australia confirmed that the government has committed to drop this. It has also agreed to an amendment clarifying that a person who works a regular pattern of work can be a casual if they want to be. The government had said this was always its intent, but employers said it was not the effect of the bill as drafted.
The chief executive of the Australian Hotels Association, Stephen Ferguson, said the commitments from the workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, were “good news for both casuals and employers alike”.
Ferguson said:
The simple fact is many hospitality workers do actually prefer casual employment, given the 25% wage loading and the flexibility to refuse shifts.
Our concern with the original Bill was that employers would no longer be able to provide systemic regular casual employment to those workers who were happy with it. The amendments which have been committed to provide much more certainty and fairness for workers and employers and can be chalked up as a win for both.
They strike the right balance – and we thank Minister Burke for taking the time to listen to our concerns and taking actions to address them.

What is a human shield and how has Hamas been accused of using them?,2023-10-30,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/30/human-shield-israel-claim-hamas-command-centre-under-hospital-palestinian-civilian-gaza-city,"Israel claims group has placed command centre under hospital and is deliberately shielding behind Palestinian civilians
In an audio recording released by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), a member of the military intelligence directorate’ can be heard calling a Palestinian man in Gaza to persuade him and his family to flee south towards Khan Younis.
But the recipient of the call complains that it is hard to comply with the Israeli warning because Hamas is blocking roads on the route south, and “just sending people back home”. The man adds that Hamas is shooting at Palestinians attempting to leave the area.
The audio is just one of numerous pieces of alleged evidence released by the IDF to support its claims that Hamas uses the civilian population of Gaza as human shields or operates in a way that shows flagrant disregard for civilian safety.
The international criminal court defines the war crime of using human shields as “utilising the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military operations”.
One interpretation of this is that it would be a war crime to fire weapons and to position bases in proximity to heavily populated civilian areas, in particular near facilities that should be protected according to the Geneva conventions, including schools, hospitals or mosques.
During conflicts against Hamas and other armed militant groups in Gaza, Israel has repeatedly accused them of deliberately shielding themselves behind Gaza’s civilian population.
Israel has cited what it says are numerous examples of Hamas using human shields as a tactic in the current conflict and in the previous war in 2014. It claims Hamas has placed parts of its military tunnel system and command network under civilian objects including Gaza City’s Dar al-Shifa hospital.
Last Friday the IDF released an infographic depicting what it said was Hamas’s command HQ under the hospital. The following day, the IDF and the Shin Bet domestic security agency released footage they said was from the interrogation of two members of Hamas’s armed wing who they said had infiltrated Israel on 7 October during the massacre of 1,400 Israelis. They appeared to confirm that Hamas militants were using hospitals in the Gaza Strip to protect themselves from IDF strikes.
One, identified as Amer Abu Awash, a member of Hamas’s elite Nukhba force, was asked about the connection between hospitals in Gaza and the “metro”, Hamas’s extensive tunnel network. A handcuffed Awash replied: “Most of them are hidden in the hospitals. [At] Shifa [hospital], for example, there are underground levels … Shifa is not small, it is a big place that can be used to hide things.”
Abu Awash was then asked by the interrogator about why Hamas was using medical institutions such as hospitals and clinics, to which he answered, “[so] you won’t strike them.”
Ezzat el-Reshiq, a Hamas official, denied allegations that the group was using the Shifa hospital as a shield for its underground military infrastructure, and said the claims have “no basis in truth”.
Hamas has also discouraged Palestinians from heeding Israel’s call to evacuate. The Hamas-run interior ministry sent a text messages telling inhabitants: “The aim is to frighten civilians, and civilians must act responsibly and not follow misleading Israeli instructions.”
Anecdotal and other evidence does suggest that Hamas and other factions have used civilian objects including hospitals and schools. Guardian journalists in 2014 encountered armed men inside one hospital, and sightings of senior Hamas leaders inside the Shifa hospital have been documented.
During the 2014 conflict the UN reported weapons were found inside two UN schools and there have been numerous reports of Palestinian armed factions in Gaza firing rockets and other weapons from close to protected civilian locations. It is also clear that Hamas has operated from residential buildings.
Making the issue more complicated, however, is the nature of Gaza and conflict there. As the territory consists mostly of an extremely dense urban environment, it is perhaps not surprising that Hamas operates in civilian areas.
International law also makes clear that even if an armed force is improperly using civilian objects to shield itself, its opponent is still required to protect civilians from disproportionate harm.
While polls suggest Hamas enjoys considerable support, Amnesty International in 2022 described Hamas’s rule as authoritarian in nature. “In the Gaza Strip, a general climate of repression, following a brutal crackdown on peaceful protests against the rising costs of living in 2019, effectively deterred dissent, often leading to self-censorship.”
Hamas’s attitude towards civilians during conflict in Gaza often appears cynical at best. After five conflicts with Israel since 2008, Hamas is well aware of the high potential for civilian deaths in fighting with Israeli forces – and has instrumentalised those fatalities in its messaging to the world.
That, however, does not absolve Israel from responsibility for the force it usesin areas where civilian deaths might be expected.
In statements over the years Hamas has made clear it sees the civilian death toll as inevitable and useful.
In 2014, the Hamas spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhari told al-Aqsa TV: “Hamas despises those defeatist Palestinians who criticise the high number of civilian casualties. The resistance praises our people … we lead our people to death … I mean, to war.”

In Gaza, where communications have been all but impossible in recent days, the reporter Hazem Balousha tells Michael Safi on Today in Focus that the intensifying assault is making everywhere in Gaza unsafe. As he speaks, the boom of aerial attacks plays out behind him and at one point he is able to catch a leaflet dropped by the Israeli Defence Forces warning him and others to evacuate the area.
In Jerusalem, the Guardian’s Middle East correspondent, Bethan McKernan, reports on the latest Israeli offensive and how the latest actions are being explained to Israelis and the wider world:
AP: A watchdog group advocating for press freedom said that the strikes that hit a group of journalists in southern Lebanon earlier this month, killing one, were targeted at the area, rather than accidental, and that the journalists were clearly identified as press.
Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, published preliminary conclusions Sunday in an ongoing investigation, based on video evidence and witness testimonies, into two strikes that killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and wounded six journalists from Reuters, AFP and Al Jazeera as they were covering clashes on the southern Lebanese border on 13 October.
The head of RSF’s Middle East desk, Jonathan Dagher, said there is not enough evidence at this stage to say the group was targeted specifically because they were journalists.
However, the report noted that the journalists wore helmets and vests marked “press,” as was the vehicle, and cited the surviving journalists as saying that they had been standing in clear view for an hour and saw an Israeli Apache helicopter flying over them before the strikes.
The first strike killed Abdallah, and the second hit a vehicle belonging to an Al Jazeera team, injuring journalists standing next to it. Both came from the direction of the Israeli border, the report said, but it did not explicitly name Israel as being responsible.
“What we can prove with facts, with evidence for the moment, is that the location where the journalists were standing was explicitly targeted...and they were clearly identifiable as journalists,” Dagher told The Associated Press Monday. “It shows that the killing of Issam Abdallah was not an accident.”
Japan has imposed a fresh set of sanctions on individuals and a company connected to the Gaza-based militant group Hamas, according to a statement released by the Japanese foreign ministry on Tuesday.The sanctions consist of freezing the assets of individuals and a company that have helped fund Hamas, and is in line with new sanctions announced by the United States government earlier this month.It is the first set of sanctions Japan has imposed on Hamas since 7 October.Individuals including Hamas operatives Muhammad Ahmad ‘Abd Al-Dayim Nasrallah and Ayman Nofal were newly added to the list of people and organisations deemed as terrorists by Japan.

Israel’s military had no immediate comment.
US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield has urged the divided UN Security Council to come together, saying “the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing more dire by the day.”
Stressing that all innocent civilians must be protected, she said the council must call “for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, address the immense humanitarian needs of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, affirm Israel’s right to defend itself from terrorism, and remind all actors that international humanitarian law must be respected.”
She reiterated President Joe Biden’s call for humanitarian pauses to get hostages out, allow aid in, and safe passage for civilians.
In a sign of increasing US concern at the escalating Palestinian death toll, Thomas-Greenfield told the council Biden reiterated to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday “that while Israel has the right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism, it must do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law.”
“The fact that Hamas operates within and under the cover of civilians areas creates an added burden for Israel, but it does not lessen its responsibility to distinguish between terrorists and innocent civilians,” she stressed.
Republicans in the US House of Representatives on Monday introduced a plan to provide $14.3bn in aid to Israel by cutting funding for the Internal Revenue Service, setting up a showdown with Democrats who control the Senate.
In one of the first major policy actions under new House speaker Mike Johnson, House Republicans unveiled a standalone supplemental spending bill only for Israel, despite Joe Biden’s request for a $106bn package that would include aid for Israel, Ukraine and border security.
Johnson, who voted against aid for Ukraine before he was elected House speaker last week, had said he wanted aid to Israel and Ukraine to be handled separately. He has said he wants more accountability for money that has been sent to the Kyiv government as it fights Russian invaders.
“Israel is a separate matter,” Johnson said in an interview on Fox News last week, describing his desire to “bifurcate” the Ukraine and Israel funding issues.
Johnson has said bolstering support for Israel should top the US national security agenda in the aftermath of the 7 October attack by Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people and saw more than 200 others taken hostage.
Democrats accused Republicans of stalling Congress’ ability to help Israel by introducing a partisan bill.
Here are some recent images out of Gaza, where nearly 3,200 children have been killed in three weeks:
AAP: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the government is working with international counterparts to provide humanitarian access to Gaza and establish a safe corridor at the Rafah crossing into Egypt to allow citizens to get to safety.
Asked whether he supported a statement from six former prime ministers who called for an end to religious hatred amid rising tensions over Israel’s response against Hamas in Gaza, Mr Albanese said his position had been clear.
“It is important that we recognise that the attacks from Hamas on Israel are worthy of absolute condemnation in an unequivocal way,” Mr Albanese told reporters in Bundaberg on Tuesday.
“It’s also important to recognise that Israel has a right to defend itself, but how it does that matters.
“We need to make sure, as well, that every civilian life is valued, whether it be Israeli or Palestinian - every innocent loss of life is a tragedy.”
It is almost 2.30am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here is where things stand:
Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out a ceasefire in Gaza, declaring “this is a time for war”. In a press conference conducted in English on Monday, the Israeli prime minister said the army’s advance through Gaza opened opportunities to free hostages, which he said Hamas would do only under pressure.
Nearly 70% of those reported killed in Gaza are children and women, said the UNRWA chief. The head of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees has warned that the level of destruction across Gaza “is unprecedented, the human tragedy unfolding under our watch is unbearable”. Philippe Lazzarini, addressing the UN security council on Monday, said nearly 3,200 children have been killed in Gaza in three weeks, citing figures by the territory’s health ministry.
The US does not believe a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is “the right answer” right now, the White House’s national security council spokesperson said. “We believe that a ceasefire right now benefits Hamas, and Hamas is the only one that would gain from that right now,” John Kirby said on Monday.
Hamas has released a video of three Israeli hostages in Gaza in an apparent effort to increase the pressure on Netanyahu’s government. Netanyahu’s office named the hostages as Daniel Aloni, Rimon Kirsht and Elena Trupanov. Their families held a press conference in Tel Aviv urging the Red Cross to demand to see all of the hostages held in Gaza, and for the US president, Joe Biden, to “do any and everything in your power to bring everyone home”.
An Israeli soldier captured by Hamas has been rescued from Gaza in an overnight operation, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. Ori Megidish, an army private, was freed on Sunday night, three weeks after she was abducted with more than 220 other hostages. After a medical check declared her healthy she was reunited with her family.
Israeli forces appear to be advancing on Gaza City in two directions. In the north of the Gaza Strip, Israeli armour was operating close to the Mediterranean coast. Witness reports described Israeli tanks cutting the main north-south Salah al-Din road south of Gaza City and operating on the outskirts of the Zaytun district and Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City. The cutting of the key road, if confirmed, would suggest that Israeli forces are attempting to cut off Gaza City from the south, effectively isolating and laying siege to the urban sprawl that extends north all the way to Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia.
A total of 26 trucks containing food supplies and medical equipment have passed through the Rafah border crossing into the Gaza Strip, the Palestine Red Crescent said on Monday. Just 144 trucks have delivered supplies to the Palestinian humanitarian organisation since 7 October, it said.
Hundreds of patients are trapped inside al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza amid intense constant bombardment around the hospital, ActionAid warned. More than 12,000 displaced people are taking shelter in the hospital’s corridors and courtyards in addition to hundreds of patients who would not survive the journey south, it said.
The humanitarian crisis in Gaza continued to worsen, with insufficient water, food, medicine and fuel, aid agencies said. The international criminal court’s top prosecutor, Karim Khan, said impeding aid could constitute a war crime and urged Israel to allow more trucks to enter.
The deepening IDF incursion into Gaza came amid dwindling Israeli public enthusiasm for a prolonged occupation. Support has fallen from 65% on 10 October to 46% now, according to a study by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which has monitored the same sample of 1,774 people, with a 4.2% margin of error.
Israeli forces struck targets in Syria and Lebanon, in response to launches from those areas into Israel, the military said. In separate tweets, the IDF said an aircraft had attacked Hezbollah targets in Lebanese territory, including “infrastructures for directing terrorism and military infrastructures of the organisation”, and that a fighter jet had attacked launchers in Syrian territory.
Israel said it carried out an operation to “thwart terrorist infrastructure in the Jenin refugee camp” in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which it claimed led to 51 people being arrested, of which it claimed 38 were operatives of Hamas.
The family of Shani Louk, a 22-year-old German-Israeli woman initially believed to have been kidnapped alive during Hamas’s assault on a music festival in Re’im, have said she died.
A Palestinian stabbed and seriously wounded an Israeli police officer before being shot dead in annexed East Jerusalem, close to the green line. Guardian correspondents about 200 metres from where the shooting took place heard two bursts of gunfire in quick succession and saw armed police, horses and sharp shooters on motorbikes converging on a nearby petrol station.
The Kremlin has said a mob that stormed a Dagestan airport in search of Jewish passengers from Israel on Sunday did so due to “outside influence”. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said “ill-wishers” had used widely seen images of suffering in Gaza to stir up feeling in the predominantly Muslim region in the north Caucasus. Local health authorities said 20 people were injured in the incident in Makhachkala.
A British Conservative MP, Paul Bristow, has been sacked from his government job after breaking ranks to publicly urge Rishi Sunak to back a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
A man accused of murder, attempted murder and a hate crime in an attack on a Palestinian American boy and his mother pleaded not guilty on Monday after his indictment by an Illinois grand jury. Joseph Czuba, 71, is charged in the fatal stabbing of six-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume and the wounding of his mother, Hanaan Shahin, on 14 October. Authorities said the victims were targeted because of their Muslim faith.
Civil rights groups in the US have warned of a “wave of McCarthyite backlash” against criticism of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza after Americans expressing support for the Palestinians have been sacked, faced threats of violence and hounded by pro-Israel groups.
Here is our video report after Israel forces announced the liberation of a hostage in Gaza. Ori Megidish, an Israel Defence Forces soldier, was freed during an escalating offensive in Gaza, the IDF said on Monday night. It said she had undergone medical checks and was doing well:
More now from Philippe Lazzarini.
“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs,” Lazzarini said, calling for the Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
According to UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, 33 trucks carrying water, food and medical supplies entered Gaza through Rafah on Sunday.
Prior to the war, some 500 trucks carrying aid and other goods entered Gaza every day.
In this opinion piece, addiction and trauma specialist Diane Young gives some advice for how to stay informed about this conflict while looking after your mental health.
The ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza has once again brought to the forefront the grim realities of war and its impact on innocent civilians. As we’re flooded with images and stories of destruction, suffering, and loss, it’s natural to feel a deep sense of sadness, empathy, helplessness and, of course, anger and dismay at what we are witnessing. Many are finding it increasingly challenging to balance their desire to stay informed with the emotional toll this crisis can take. Unfortunately, this can lead to secondary trauma.
Secondary trauma, also known as vicarious trauma, is a phenomenon where individuals experience symptoms of trauma as a result of witnessing or hearing about traumatic events happening to others, even if they aren’t directly involved. In the context of the Israel-Gaza crisis, secondary trauma can manifest as feelings of grief and extreme sadness, anxiety and depression, helplessness, and even physical symptoms like headaches or stomach aches.
For those trying to stay informed, the distressing images and videos can take a toll on their mental and emotional wellbeing. The line between being an informed and empathic global citizen and subjecting oneself to secondary trauma can be quite thin, and many of us find it difficult to turn away from the images flashing on our screens. We are in a state of disbelief.
So, how can you navigate this difficult terrain while staying informed without succumbing to secondary or vicarious trauma? Here are some strategies:
Lazzarini added that there is no place is safe in Gaza, and warned that a further breakdown of civil order in the territory would make it “extremely difficult if not impossible” to deliver more aid.
“Most of the people of Gaza felt abandoned. They feel the world is equating all of them to Hamas. This is dangerous – an entire population is being dehumanised. The atrocities of Hamas do not absolve the state of Israel from its obligations under international humanitarian law. Every war has rules and this one is no exception,” he said.
Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general for the UN relief and works agency (UNRWA), has accused Israel of “collective punishment” of the people of Gaza, and of forcing their displacement from the north of the territory to the south – where they are still not safe.
More than 8,000 Palestinians have now been killed in Israel’s attack, who Lazzarini said included 64 UNRWA staff.
He said that a UN worker named Samir, as well Samir’s wife and eight children, were killed just hours before the meeting.
The Swiss-Italian official said:
My UNRWA colleagues are the only glimmer of hope for the entire Gaza Strip … but they are running out of fuel, water, food and medicine and will soon be unable to operate
The entire population of Gaza is becoming “dehumanised” the commissioner general for the main UN agency in Palestine has told the UN security council, adding that a ceasefire has become a matter of life and death for millions.
Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general for the UN relief and works agency (UNRWA) was one of three speakers to starkly describe the scale of the damage being inflicted on Gaza, as UN agencies piled pressure on the security council to set aside its divisions and back some form of immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
The speakers detailed a breakdown in civil order, the loss of clean water and a death rate of children that matches the total number of children killed in conflict in the last four years.
The debate called by the United Arab Emirates was intended to build on the momentum created by Friday’s vote by the UN general assembly calling for a humanitarian truce, a vote seen as a way of shaming the superpowers to abandon their arguments for not backing a form of ceasefire.
Four previous draft UN security council resolutions on the crisis have been vetoed either by Russia or the US. Efforts are now being made by the 10 elected members of the security council – including Brazil, the current security council president – to frame a resolution that the five permanent members would feel forced to adopt.
Israel’s expansion of its ground operations in Gaza has complicated US efforts to secure the release of hostages being held in the Palestinian territory, according to a report.
A senior US official told CNN on Monday that they believed the prospects of getting hostages out could be described as “50/50”.
“The parameters are all there,” the official said about a potential deal, but efforts to negotiate with Hamas have been slow, they said.
A spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign affairs ministry told the outlet that Israel’s escalation on the ground is making the situation “considerably more difficult”.
Ongoing talks involving Israel, Qatar, Egypt, the US and Hamas have centered on freeing hostages in exchange for prisoners being held by Israel, according to a source.
They have also included getting Hamas to open the Rafah gates for dual nationals to get out of Gaza, they said.
Cyprus is doubling the capacity of its main migrant reception camp in preparation for a potentially large influx of people if the Israel-Gaza conflict escalates, according to authorities, Associated Press reported.
The Pournara reception camp on the outskirts of the capital, Nicosia, currently has a capacity of 1,153 people.
It will also receive an increase in staffing to adequately provide needed care to new arrivals and expedite asylum application processing, Cyprus’ interior minister Constantinos Ioannou said in a statement.

‘I want him to come home’: Thai family awaits news of son abducted in Israel,2023-10-31,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/israel-hamas-family-await-news-son-taken-hostage-thousand-thai-migrant-worker,"Komkrit Chombua was one of thousands of Thai migrant workers in Israel when he was taken hostage by Hamas
For three weeks, Sunan Chombua has waited anxiously for news about his son. On 7 October, a photograph shared online showed Komkrit Chombua, 29, sitting on the floor, head bowed, among a group of hostages taken by Hamas.
“When I looked at the phone and I saw his picture, I knew immediately it was him,” Sunan said. “I want the government to negotiate with them quicker, faster. I want to see him again, I want him to come home.”
Komkrit had moved from his home in rural Thailand four years ago to work in Israel, one of thousands of Thais who have done so, often propping up the country’s agriculture sector. This month they have found themselves in the centre of a war zone, and Thais are thought to be the biggest group of foreign nationals killed or missing in the Hamas attacks, according to Israel.
The Thai government has said 22 of its nationals have been taken hostage. A further 32 have been killed and 19 injured.
Komkrit’s parents had never wanted him to move away for work, but the salary abroad is far higher. “He just wanted to help us,” said Sunan, who is a subsistence rice farmer. “Before, we didn’t have a proper house, just a small little hut. We didn’t have money.”
Komkrit sent back enough money for his parents to build a home. “He hasn’t had a chance to see it yet,” Sunan said.
Komkrit would call every weekday but didn’t talk much about life in Israel, instead asking if his father had eaten, and telling them he would send money soon.
In Israel he could earn the equivalent of up to 50,000 baht (£1,145) a month – far more than the minimum wage in Thailand, which is about 10,620 baht a month. He worked first in agriculture and then construction.
Komkrit had told them before about violence locally, including one time when he had hid in a bunker. The fighting would normally end in a few days, he would say, adding that he didn’t feel unsafe.
Workers’ rights experts, however, say migrant workers are especially vulnerable. Often employers and middlemen neglect to brief them properly about how to protect themselves, and a language barrier means they have less access to information, said Assia Ladizhinskaya, a spokesperson for Kav LaOved, which advocates for marginalised workers in Israel.
“Many workers, they have never heard a siren before. We have been interviewing workers in previous wars and they didn’t know this sound means danger – they didn’t know that they have to run and hide,” said Ladizhinskaya.
If the field is far away from houses, they might not even hear a siren. Nor would Iron Dome, Israel’s anti-missile system that intercepts rockets launched from the Gaza Strip, protect the kinds of open spaces where they worked, she added.
On the day of the Hamas attack, in which 1,400 Israelis were killed, Kav LaOved received messages from migrant workers, some asking where they should go to hide.
According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, some workers hid in orchards from early morning until 11am the next day. “A government that abandoned its citizens certainly abandoned the workers who grow its fruit and vegetables,” Hareetz wrote.
Thousands of Thai workers have been evacuated by their government over recent weeks. Some, though, are worried about returning home as they paid large fees to work abroad.
“A lot of them have taken loans, either from banks or the informal sector. They’ve mortgaged land or a house,” said Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “[The work arrangement is] predicated on the idea that the first year or two you’re working to pay off debt,” he added.
Thai workers were reluctant to complain, even when they faced mistreatment, due to the imbalance of power, said Ladizhinskaya.
She said Israel depended upon migrant workers but treated them as disposable. “Each time some group is becoming more aware of their rights … Israel finds a group which is weaker to replace them,” she said.
In Israel, relatives of those being held by Hamas met the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Saturday after gathering outside the defence ministry headquarters, asking to know what strategies were in place to free the captives. Many fear their loved ones could be killed in airstrikes as Israel proceeds with its escalated assault on Gaza.
Israel estimates of the number of Thai nationals taken hostage are higher than those given by authorities in Bangkok. It said last week that 54 Thai nationals were among the 220 hostages taken. The Thai prime minister, Srettha Thavisin, however, said it was possible the Israeli figure included a combination of confirmed deaths, abductions and missing people.
At a UN General Assembly meeting last week, the Israeli envoy to the UN showed a brief video, which he said showed a Hamas fighter trying to decapitate a man with a garden tool during the 7 October attacks. Ambassador Gilad Erdan told diplomats the victim was a Thai agricultural worker.
Thailand said the video had “stirred a sense of outrage not only among Thais but undoubtedly people throughout the world”. It also criticised the decision to play the video, saying this failed to show “proper respect and due consideration” for the deceased and his family.
Komkrit’s father said the family received updates from the Thai authorities every few days. “The latest was that they said all the hostages are safe but they don’t know the location,” he said.
His wife was initially unable to eat or sleep when they heard Komkrit had been taken, he said. But she had become stronger and was keeping hope, he added.
“I would like to tell my son to please be patient and strong. I am fine,” he said. “Please be safe, take care of yourself.”

Keir Starmer cautions Israel but refuses to back calls for ceasefire,2023-10-31,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/31/keir-starmer-israel-hamas-ceasefire-may-risk-further-violence,"Labour leader criticises Israeli bombardment but says ceasefire is not ‘the correct position now’
Keir Starmer has urged Israel to obey international law but refused to back calls for a ceasefire, as he seeks to heal increasingly bitter divisions within his own party over the conflict in Gaza.
The Labour leader spelled out his position on the crisis in detail on Tuesday after days of criticism from many of his own members and MPs that he appeared oblivious to the suffering of Palestinians.
In an attempt to reassure MPs and councillors who have threatened to quit the party over the issue, Starmer gave his most direct criticism yet of the Israeli bombardment, expressing “concern” over some of its actions and urging the Israeli government to allow fuel to cross into Gaza.
But he rejected calls made by some of his most high-profile colleagues for an immediate ceasefire in the region, saying such a move would make it harder to rescue Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas.
“While I understand calls for a ceasefire at this stage, I do not believe that it is the correct position now,” he told an audience at the Chatham House foreign affairs thinktank in London.
He said a ceasefire would “freeze the conflict”, allowing Hamas to launch attacks against Israel again in the future. “Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately,” he said, adding that he wanted instead to see a temporary “humanitarian pause” in fighting.
The comments were a direct rejection of calls for a ceasefire made by, among others, the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham.
At least 13 shadow ministers – including Alex Cunningham, Afzal Khan, Rushanara Ali, Andy Slaughter, Jess Phillips and Florence Eshalomi – have also joined calls for an end to the fighting.
Starmer also refused to support the judgment of the UN among others that war crimes may have been committed during the bombardment of Gaza.
“Israel has to act in accordance with the law,” he said. But he added: “I think it’s unwise for politicians to stand on stages like this or to sit in television studios and pronounce day by day which acts may or may not be lawful under international law.”
His comments were criticised by Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Amnesty International UK, who said: “In failing to call for an immediate ceasefire, Keir Starmer is not showing the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs.”He said it was “deeply disappointing” that Starmer “did not use this moment to be clear that under his leadership the UK would be consistent and rigorous in supporting international law”.
The Labour leader did go further than he had recently in his criticism of Israel’s actions since the Hamas attack of 7 October.
Starmer said the recent 36-hour communications blackout that led to people in Gaza being unable to call for an ambulance after being hit by rocket attacks was a “concern”. He said those who had been forced to flee their homes should receive “crystal clear guarantees they will be able to return”.
He called it unacceptable that the siege conditions around Gaza had not been lifted, and he urged Israel to allow fuel into the strip, something Israel is refusing to do, instead accusing Hamas of hoarding supplies.
As Starmer left the venue of his speech, his vehicle was surrounded by protesters who demanded an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Police officers pushed them aside but the protesters ran at the car and drummed on the window.
Since the war broke out earlier this month, Starmer has struggled to maintain discipline within his party over the issue. Tensions started after Starmer gave an interview with LBC during the Labour party conference in which he appeared to suggest Israel was justified in cutting off electricity and water to Gaza.
Since then, multiple members of the shadow cabinet have urged him to show more compassion to the suffering of ordinary Palestinians, several Labour councillors have quit the party in protest and the party’s most well-known devolved leaders have broken ranks to call for a ceasefire.
On Monday the Labour MP Andy McDonald was suspended by the party for using the phrase “between the river and the sea” during a pro-Palestinian protest – a phrase that some see as calling for the destruction of Israel.
Starmer on Tuesday refused to comment on McDonald’s case but urged MPs “to be extremely careful about the language that we use”.
So far the Labour leader has shied away from punishing shadow cabinet ministers who have called for a ceasefire despite that not being the official party position.
He insisted on Tuesday that the shadow cabinet was still bound by collective responsibility. But he added that he would not necessarily take a hard line against those who breached it on this issue.
“It’s my job to ensure we do have collective responsibility,” he said. “I will do it sensitively and engaging with my frontbenches.”

"Britons go map-crazy, with geographical games and books becoming bestsellers",2023-10-31,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/oct/31/metro-memory-and-tim-marshall-put-cartography-back-on-the-map,"London tube game Metro Memory is a surprise hit, with geography books also finding favour with readers
In a world where we get from A to B by following the shortest route on our phones or satnavs, are cartographers mapping their way back into our national psyche?
Rather than ignoring what is around us, we appear to be increasingly fascinated with locations and their significance, whether it is through a viral tube map game, YouTube videos or books about geopolitics.
According to the software developer Benjamin Tran Dinh, his online game Metro Memory – which requires players to name as many of the 416 London TfL stations as they can – has had more than 400,000 plays since it was launched two weeks ago.
“The game was much more popular in London than in other cities,” the 32-year-old, who has also made versions for Paris and Berlin, said. “I did not expect it to grow this much across the Channel.”
When making the game, Tran Dinh, who is based in Paris, said he was drawn back to memories of studying in London a decade ago, when he was a regular user of South Kensington tube station and the Circle and District lines, and would sometimes go climbing at Latimer Road. This sentiment, he believes, is behind Metro Memory’s popularity.
“Maps tell different stories depending on the reader’s location,” he said. “They are also a visual way to anchor those stories in the real world. In the case of Metro Memory, I have seen people zoom in on the map, remember a specific moment they have spent in a certain neighbourhood and suddenly link that memory to a station name.”
Ordnance Survey, the national mapping agency for Great Britain, said 2022-23 was the first time that digital consumer mapping overtook paper in revenue.
Nick Giles, OS’s managing director for leisure, added: “Last year we sold over 1.5m paper maps and we are seeing a huge rise in demand for curated guidebooks with route information contained within them, such as our Pathfinder series [curated walking routes].
“On digital, OS Maps app has now been downloaded approximately 6 million times and we are seeing an average of 1 million users per month. We are finding that people like crossing over between physical and digital maps – they like planning and using through different media.”
Three of the paperbacks on the Sunday Times top 10 bestsellers list at the moment have been authored by one man – Tim Marshall, whose books The Future of Geography, Prisoners of Geography and The Power of Geography have proven a hit with readers.
The former Sky News diplomatic editor said he became interested in geography as a young reporter covering the Bosnian war in the 1990s, when he “realised how knowing the geography of the terrain would help me understand both what might be possible militarily and politically”.
He said people were drawn to his books because they were “rediscovering that understanding the geography of certain situations is as important as understanding the history and politics”. According to Marshall, all three are linked.
“This is not ‘geographic determinism’, it’s an acceptance that geography has a role in what happens,” he said. Maps, according to the writer, help you assess what is and is not possible, and therefore what might or might not happen in a region.
“Geographical and ideological faultlines can been seen everywhere. Current examples are Armenia/Azerbaijan, Ukraine/Russia, and of course Palestine/Israel.
“Demographic ethnic faultlines seen in human geography also play a role in many conflicts, for example in the Ethiopian civil war, the insurgency in Mali, and in Myanmar. Of course there is much more to the roots of conflict than geography, but it should not be overlooked.”
Whether it is because Britons are suddenly keen to determine future conflicts or just want to stock up on information, it is safe to say cartographers are having their moment.
The Horrible Histories-style “edu-tainment” videos by Mark Cooper-Jones and Jay Foreman, the so-called Map Men, have become a YouTube sensation. The pair – one a former geography teacher and the other a fellow self-confessed geek – have said they are even stopped in the street by fans asking for selfies.
Their videos on subjects such as “The world’s worst border” and “How did triangles shrink France?” regularly attract 1m to 5m views, and are shown by teachers in the classroom.
According to Michael Howe, whose book Terrible Maps: Hilarious Maps for a Ridiculous World was released by HarperCollins this month, people “look to maps to help them quickly understand complex data and spot interesting patterns”.
Howe’s book is based on his popular Terrible Maps social media feed, which has 1.7 million followers on X. It “celebrates pointless cartography in all its glory” – from the average jeans colour across the US to what unites the villages of Brokenwind, Upton Snodsbury and Crackpot.
“There’s always been a sense of adventure associated with maps, for obvious reasons,” he said. “Even within any given map there’s a feeling of exploration as your eyes scan around taking in information. Ultimately these days I think people just want everything in an easily digestible format and don’t have the attention span to read long sentences.”
But while maps can tell a story through the data they display in a way that feels familiar and fun, Howe issued a word of caution. “Just be wary, because they may also be intentionally divisive and amplify bias. Or they may just be plain terrible,” he said.

The clash of right versus right in the Middle East conflict | Letters,2023-11-01,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/01/the-clash-of-right-versus-right-in-the-middle-east-conflict,"Dr Raia Browning and Janet Dobson respond to Jonathan Freedland’s article on the Israel-Palestine conflict
Jonathan Freedland is correct to describe the Israel-Palestine conflict as a clash of right versus right (The tragedy of the Israel-Palestine conflict is this: underneath all the horror is a clash of two just causes, 28 August). But he overlooks the power differential within which this clash occurs – the very severe constraints on Gazans over the last 16 years, and the Israeli military protecting Jewish settlers taking over more and more Palestinian land in the West Bank. This is not a clash between equals, but between an occupying force and a subjugated population. But there is no military solution to this conflict. A negotiated compromise, as in Northern Ireland, where both parties are recognised as equal political agents, can be the only way forward.Dr Raia BrowningOxford
 Thank you, Jonathan Freedland, for a perspective on the Palestine-Israel conflict that I share. In 1960, as a student visiting Poland, I went to Auschwitz. I have never forgotten the horror of what I saw there. A few years later I travelled in the Middle East and met Palestinian refugees. They were gentle, hospitable people who mourned the loss of their homes and land when Israel was created. I have never forgotten them either. What is happening now in Gaza is unbearable. If neither “side” can find leaders who see both sides, what hope is there?Janet DobsonDunnington, North Yorkshire

Colombia recalls ambassador to Israel – as it happened,2023-11-01,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/31/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-latest-news-today-hamas-clashes-idf-gaza-aid-plan-failure,"This blog is now closed.
The US and Israel are considering the possibility of a multinational force that could include American, UK, French troops in the Gaza Strip, in the event that Israeli forces are successful in ousting Hamas, according to a report.
US and Israeli officials exploring options for the future of Gaza have also discussed a second option that would establish a peacekeeping force modeled on one that oversees a 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the conversations.
A third option would see Gaza put under temporary UN oversight, it said. The sources noted that the conversations are still at an early stage and much could change.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, alluded to the challenge of coming up with a plan for the future of Gaza when he addressed a Senate panel on Tuesday.
“We can’t have a reversion to the status quo with Hamas running Gaza,” Blinken told the Senate appropriations committee. “We also can’t have — and the Israelis start with this proposition themselves — Israel running or controlling Gaza.” He added:
Between those shoals are a variety of possible permutations that we’re looking at very closely now, as are other countries.
This blog is closing now. We have launched a new blog at the link below:
South of the Gaza City, Israeli troops are reportedly still trying to cut off Gaza’s main highway and the parallel road along the Mediterranean coast, according to Dawood Shehab, a spokesperson for Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas.
Zaki Abdel-Hay, a Palestinian living a few minutes’ walk from the road south of Gaza City, told the Associate Press people are afraid to use it. “People are very scared. The Israeli tanks are still close,” he said over the phone, adding that “constant artillery fire” could be heard near the road.
Here is a more on the South American nations taking diplomatic action and calling for a ceasefire, via Reuters.
Bolivia said on Tuesday it had broken diplomatic ties with Israel because of its attacks on the Gaza Strip, while neighbours Colombia and Chile recalled their ambassadors to the Middle Eastern country for consultations.The three South American nations lambasted Israel’s attacks on Gaza and condemned the deaths of Palestinian citizens.Bolivia “decided to break diplomatic relations with the Israeli state in repudiation and condemnation of the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in the Gaza Strip,” Deputy Foreign Minister Freddy Mamani said at a press conference.The three countries called for a ceasefire, with Bolivia and Chile pushing for the passage of humanitarian aid into the zone and accusing Israel of violating international law.Colombian President Gustavo Petro called the attacks a “massacre of the Palestinian people” in a post on the social media network X, formerly known as Twitter.Israel’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Other Latin American countries, such as Mexico and Brazil, have also called for a ceasefire.“What we have now is the insanity of Israel’s prime minister, who wants to wipe out the Gaza Strip,” said Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Friday.Bolivia is among the first countries to actively break diplomatic relations with Israel over its war in Gaza. Bolivia cut diplomatic ties with Israel in 2009 under the government of leftist President Evo Morales, also in protest against Israel’s actions in Gaza.In 2020, the government of right-wing interim President Jeanine Anez reestablished ties.“We reject the war crimes being committed in Gaza. We support international initiatives to guarantee humanitarian aid, in compliance with international law,” Bolivian President Arce said on social media on Monday.
Palestinian telecommunications company Paltel says that there is another “complete interruption of all communications and Internet services with the Gaza Strip.”
Writing on twitter it said that international routes have been cut off.
The tweet reads: “Dear people in our beloved homeland, We regret to announce a complete interruption of all communications and Internet services with the Gaza Strip, due to international routes that were previously reconnected being cut off again. May God protect you and protect our country.”
Gaza lost internet access on Friday before it was restored.
More now on the reports that injured Palestinians and foreign nationals in Gaza could be allowed to enter Egypt for treatment.
Earlier the border authority in Gaza said that Egypt had agreed to let in 81 of the most badly wounded on Wednesday through Rafah, the only crossing not controlled by Israel.
A photographer with the AFP news agency has reported seeing a large number of ambulances gathered at Rafah.
Separately, a medical official in the Egyptian city of El Arish told AFP that medical teams will be present at the Rafah crossing to examine cases and determine which hospitals they will be sent to.
The medical official added that a field hospital with an area of 1,300 square metres would be built to receive the wounded Palestinians in the city of Sheikh Zuweid in northern Sinai, about 15km from Rafah.
The BBC has reported that the UK Foreign Office has informed British nationals trapped in Gaza that Rafah might open for limited exits.
According to that report, the Foreign Office was unable to provide details on how the opening would be managed and who would be permitted to leave.
Colombia has become the latest country to register a diplomatic protest against Israel.
The country’s leftwing president, Gustavo Petro, said on Tuesday he had recalled his ambassador over Israel’s “massacre of the Palestinian people”.
Earlier we reported that Chile had also recalled its ambassador from Israel, while Bolivia has cut ties with the country entirely.
The Associated Press: Republicans criticised Lew for his role in the Obama White House when it negotiated the Iran nuclear agreement in 2015, among other foreign policy moves. The deal with Iran — the chief sponsor of Hamas — was later scuttled by former President Donald Trump.
“This is the wrong person at the wrong time in the wrong place,” said Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, just before the vote. “The last thing we need is somebody who is very contrary to our view about how Iran should be handled.”
At the hearing, Lew defended his work in the Obama White House and called Iran an “evil, malign government.”
“I want to be clear — Iran is a threat to regional stability and to Israel’s existence,” Lew said.
He also expressed sympathy for the civilians on both sides who have been injured or killed in the fighting. It must end, Lew said, “but it has to end with Israel’s security being guaranteed.”
Lew, who is Jewish, said at the hearing that he cannot remember a time in his life “when Israel’s struggle for security was not at the forefront of my mind.”
Here is more on the new US ambassador to Israel, whose appointment was confirmed on Tuesday, via the Associated Press:
Jacob Lew, a treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, was confirmed 53-43.
He has promised to stand side by side with Israel’s leaders as they respond to the militant group’s surprise attack on 7 October, telling senators in his confirmation hearing in mid-October that “at this moment, there is no greater mission than to be asked to strengthen the ties between the United States and the state of Israel.”
President Joe Biden nominated Lew, who goes by Jack, last month to fill the post left vacant when Tom Nides left as ambassador in July. Democrats say Lew’s wealth of government experience – he also was chief of staff to Obama and White House budget director under Obama and President Bill Clinton – makes him the right person to fill the post at a a critical moment in the two countries’ relationship.
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said after Lew’s confirmation that the administration is eager for him “to get on the ground and start leading our efforts to support Israel and their fight against Hamas, but also to help us integrate and continue to lead the effort to get humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza.”
Republicans have a 221-212 majority in the House, but Biden’s fellow Democrats control the Senate 51-49. To become law, the bill would have to pass both the House and Senate and be signed by Biden.The top Senate Democrat said the Republican bill would be dead on arrival in the upper chamber, even if it passed the House.Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate said he felt the four issues needed to be addressed.“We need to treat all four of these areas, all four of them, Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the border,” McConnell told reporters.
Reuters: US senators from both parties voiced doubts on Tuesday about House Republicans’ plan to provide $14.3bn in aid to Israel by cutting Internal Revenue Service funding, without providing aid to Ukraine, and Democratic President Joe Biden threatened to veto the bill were it to pass.In the first major legislative action under new Speaker Mike Johnson, House of Representatives Republicans unveiled a standalone supplemental spending bill only for Israel on Monday.This is despite President Joe Biden’s request for a $106bn package that would include aid for Israel and Ukraine and funding to boost competition with China in the Indo-Pacific as well as security along the U.S. border with Mexico.
“The bottom line is it’s not a serious proposal,” Senate Democratic Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, told reporters.The administration said Biden would veto such a bill were it to reach his desk.“This bill is bad for Israel, for the Middle East region, and for our own national security,” the White House’s Office of Management and Budget said.
More now from that call: US President Joe Biden and Jordan’s King Abdullah on Tuesday discussed their shared commitment to increasing aid to civilians in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas conflict, the White House said.The two men also reiterated the importance of protecting civilian lives and that it was critical to ensure that Palestinians were not forcibly displaced from Gaza, the White House said.
Biden and King Abdullah II of Jordan have held a phone call during which they “agreed that it is critical to ensure that Palestinians are not forcibly displaced outside of Gaza,” Reuters reports the White House as saying.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking earlier on Tuesday at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, said there were around 400 American citizens and their family members totalling around 1,000 people stuck in Gaza and wanting to get out.“We’re working with various parties to try to facilitate their departure from Gaza. The impediment is simple: It is Hamas,” Blinken said, adding that there were another roughly 5,000 foreign nationals who were hoping to get out.
“Chile strongly condemns and observes with great concern... these military operations,” Chilean president Gabriel Boric wrote in a post on social media platform X as he announced that Chile is recalling its ambassador to Israel.
Chilean president Gabriel Boric has announced that Chile is recalling its ambassador to Israel for consultations.
The reason for the recall is the “violations of international humanitarian law” in the Gaza strip, Reuters reports.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday “emphasised the need to take feasible precautions to minimise harm to civilians” during a telephone call with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, the State Department said, amid the conflict with Hamas.“The Secretary reiterated US support for Israel’s right to defend itself against terrorism consistent with international humanitarian law,” spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement.

Hundreds of Labour councillors urge Keir Starmer to back Gaza ceasefire,2023-11-01,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/01/hundreds-of-labour-councillors-urge-keir-starmer-to-back-gaza-ceasefire,"Letter signed by at least 330 councillors says refusal to back end to violence is ‘harming communities’
At least 330 Labour councillors have signed a letter urging Keir Starmer to back a ceasefire in Gaza, despite the Labour leader’s attempts to reassure the party over the issue.
The councillors, two-thirds of whom the Guardian understands are not Muslim, have criticised the party’s refusal to back the policy, which they say is “harming communities across the UK”.
Starmer detailed his position on the crisis on Tuesday after mounting criticism from MPs over his stance on the suffering of Palestinians.
But the councillors have urged him to go further and “unequivocally condemn” all acts of violence against civilians.
“As community leaders, we are proactively supporting our residents by speaking to faith and community groups and working to protect our communities who are facing rising hate crime and racially motivated violence,” the letter says.
“The intensified human catastrophe in Gaza impacts us all, and the Labour party’s failure to call for an end to violence is causing hurt in our communities.”
Reacting to Starmer’s speech, one Labour official formerly critical of Starmer’s stance said the speech had done enough to keep the party together in the short term.
“We can stand by this position,” they said. “The main thing is to look like we care about Palestinian lives rather than arguing about the technical difference behind a ceasefire versus a pause.”
But other senior Labour figures said his remarks had done little to hold the parliamentary party together. One insider said Labour MPs were stressed, desperately trying to stop their colleagues at the national and local level from resigning.
This open letter to Starmer comes after at least 250 Labour Muslim councillors called on the leadership to call for a ceasefire.
Starmer gave his most direct criticism yet of the Israeli bombardment, expressing “concern” over some of its actions and urging Israel to allow fuel to cross into Gaza.
Speaking to an audience at the Chatham House foreign affairs thinktank in London, Starmer said: “While I understand calls for a ceasefire at this stage, I do not believe that it is the correct position now.”
Starmer insisted he took collective responsibility – the principle that members of his frontbench team adopt a unified position – seriously, but he gave no indication he was about to sack those who had spoken out.
“It is for me to address collective responsibility, I recognise that,” he said.
He said a ceasefire would “freeze the conflict”, allowing Hamas to launch attacks against Israel again in the future.

“Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately,” he said, adding that he wanted instead to see a temporary “humanitarian pause” in fighting.
The comments were a direct rejection of calls for a ceasefire made by, among others, the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham.
At least 13 shadow ministers – including Alex Cunningham, Afzal Khan, Rushanara Ali, Andy Slaughter, Jess Phillips and Florence Eshalomi – have also joined calls for an end to the fighting.
Starmer also refused to support the judgment of the UN among others that war crimes may have been committed during the bombardment of Gaza.
“Israel has to act in accordance with the law,” he said. But he added: “I think it’s unwise for politicians to stand on stages like this or to sit in television studios and pronounce day by day which acts may or may not be lawful under international law.”
His comments were criticised by Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Amnesty International UK, who said: “In failing to call for an immediate ceasefire, Keir Starmer is not showing the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs.”
He said it was “deeply disappointing” that Starmer “did not use this moment to be clear that under his leadership the UK would be consistent and rigorous in supporting international law”.

Israel and Hamas at war: what we know on day 30,2023-11-05,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/05/israel-and-hamas-at-war-what-we-know-on-day-30,"Blinken makes surprise visit to meet Abbas in Ramallah; Israel claims to have struck ‘over 2,500 terror targets’ during campaign against Hamas
Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday again rejected calls for a ceasefire in Gaza until all of the more than 240 hostages captured by Hamas during its 7 October attack are returned. “There will be no ceasefire without the return of our hostages, we say this to both our enemies and our friends. We will continue until we beat them,” Reuters Netanyahu told air and ground crews at the Ramon air force base in southern Israel, reiterating the government’s position.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an unannounced visit to meet Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah after meeting with Arab foreign ministers in Jordan. A spokesman for Abbas said after the meeting that the Palestinian president had called for an immediate ceasefire and the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Al Jazeera reported small protests against the visit took place.
The US said Blinken reaffirmed the US commitment to the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance and resumption of essential services in Gaza and made clear that Palestinians must not be forcibly displaced. It has refused to back calls for a ceasefire, arguing that it would allow Hamas to re-group.
Blinken also visited Cyprus, where he spoke to president Nikos Christodoulides about Cypriot proposals for a maritime humanitarian corridor to deliver aid to Gaza.
Israel says that in the combined activities of its ground, air and naval forces in the Gaza Strip, “over 2,500 terror targets have been struck”. Israel launched the campaign on 7 October after the surprise Hamas attack inside Israel’s borders that killed more than 1,400 Israelis, and during which at least 240 people were abducted and taken into Gaza as hostages.
It is reported that at least 9,770 Palestinians, including 4,008 children, have been killed in Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip since 7 October. In addition, the Palestinian Authority health ministry in the Israeli-occupied West Bank says that 152 Palestinians have been killed and 2,100 wounded since 7 October. The claims have not been independently verified.
IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari has demanded that Hamas stop using hospital facilities in Gaza, saying “we will not accept Hamas’s cynical use of hospitals to hide their terror infrastructures”. In a Sunday afternoon briefing in English, Hagari presented what Israel claimed was evidence that the Indonesia hospital in Bait Lahia was built over existing Hamas infrastructure that Israel had photographed in 2010.
Evacuations for civilians and heavily wounded Palestinians from Gaza have been suspended since Saturday, according to Egyptian security and medical sources said, following an Israeli strike on ambulances near the entrance to Gaza City’s main Dar al-Shifa hospital. Israel later claimed Hamas was using an ambulance to move its fighters. The health ministry in Gaza has appealed to Egypt to allow Egyptian ambulances into the Gaza Strip to treat the wounded.
The head of the World Food Programme (WFP), Cindy McCain, said on Sunday that the aid entering Gaza was “nowhere near” enough to meet the needs of people there, which she added were growing exponentially. “We need to continue to work together to get safe and sustained access to Gaza at a scale that aligns with the catastrophic conditions facing families there,” McCain said in a statement after visiting the Rafah border crossing
More than 300 US citizens have left Gaza, but there are still those who remain in the besieged Gaza Strip, White House official Jonathan Finer told the CBS show Face the Nation.
More than 100 Britons have been evacuated from Gaza and the government hopes more will be able to leave, the UK’s deputy prime minister said on Sunday, as he urged the reopening of the Rafah crossing. Oliver Dowden said “The first thing we are doing is trying to make sure we get the Rafah crossing open again and I’m hopeful we will make progress on that today. Secondly, we are seeking to have these temporary pauses to allow humanitarian aid in and to get our people out”. The UK government has also refused to back calls for a ceasefire.
Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said on Sunday that there had been “false” reports on negotiations to release Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Qatar’s foreign ministry said that efforts to secure the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza required a “period of calm”, and that leaks from the negotiations are “harmful” and make it difficult for mediators to do their jobs.
The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, said in Doha on Sunday that too many civilians had died in Israeli strikes on Gaza. Colonna added that an international humanitarian conference, to be hosted by France on 9 November, would cover respecting international law, basic needs such as health, water, energy and food, and would call for concrete action to help civilians in Gaza.
Pope Francis made an urgent plea for a halt to the conflict in Gaza on Sunday, calling for humanitarian aid and help for those injured in order to ease the “very grave” situation. “I keep thinking about the grave situation in Palestine and Israel where many people have lost their life. I pray you to stop in the name of God, cease the fire,” he said, speaking to crowds in St Peter’s Square after his weekly Angelus prayer.
The World Health Organization in Palestine has issued an updated bulletin in which it says it has documented 102 attacks on healthcare facilities within the Gaza Strip since 7 October.
An Israeli drone struck near two ambulance on their way to pick up casualties from overnight strikes in southern Lebanon, wounding four paramedics, local officials have claimed.
Netanyahu has sought to distance himself from comments by a minister in his government that dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza is “one of the possibilities” and that the Palestinian population can “go to Ireland or deserts”. Heritage minister Amichai Eliyahu of the Otzma Yehudit party made the comments in a radio interview. Netanyahu said the statements “are not based in reality” and suspended Eliyahu from cabinet meetings. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called for him to be fired, saying the comments harmed Israe’s “international standing”.
Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, has posted an image to social media of his family reunited after his in-laws were trapped inside Gaza by the Israeli blockade and the closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt.
I am pleased to say my in-laws are safe and back home  ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِWe are, of course, elated, but my father-in-law said, ""My heart is broken in two, and with my mum, son & grandchildren in Gaza."" He then broke down telling me how hard it was saying goodbye to them. pic.twitter.com/rJxccT6SkQ
Pro-Palestinian demonstrators staged protests in London, Berlin, Paris, Ankara, Istanbul, Sydney and Washington on Saturday to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Hamas’s armed wing said more than 60 hostages were missing due to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam brigades, also said on Hamas’s Telegram account that 23 bodies of Israeli hostages were trapped under the rubble. Reuters could not immediately verify the statement.
The Committee to Protect Journalists has said that more media workers have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war than in any other conflict in the area since it started monitoring in 1992. As of Friday, 36 media workers — 31 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese — have been killed since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, according to the group.
Agence France-Presse has called on Israel ot provide “an in-depth and transparent investigation” into the exact involvement of its army after a strike severely damaged its office in Gaza City, which has been shelled for weeks. “A strike on the offices of an international news agency sends a deeply troubling message to all the journalists working in such difficult conditions in Gaza,” the news agency’s chairman and CEO Fabrice Fries said.

‘I could never dream such a nightmare’: Gaza in grip of humanitarian disaster,2023-11-06,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/06/conditions-worsen-in-gaza-shelters-there-are-lots-of-diseases-now,"UN official, medics and displaced people tell of overcrowding, panic and lack of essentials as bombardment continues
UN-run shelters in Gaza are so crowded that it is impossible to count the people needing food, water, medicine and other basics, administrators say, as more fighting and bombardments continue to arrive.
“It is a terrible, terrible situation. There is no room even to sleep on the floor. There is one toilet for 700 or 800 people. No bread, no stoves for cooking. We are drinking irrigation water,” one UN official at a compound in the southern city of Khan Younis told the Guardian on Monday night.
“No one can get an accurate number of IDPs [internally displaced persons] here. We know nothing about what happens outside. Everyone is just concentrating on survival,” said the official, who was not authorised to speak to the media.
With a conflict that began with Hamas’s murderous assault on southern Israel on 7 October now entering a second month, the humanitarian toll from Israel’s attack on the territory has been enormous. The Hamas-run health authority has said 10,022 people have died in Gaza, including 4,104 children. Hamas’s attack left 1,400 Israelis dead.
Nur Hatib, 33, a kindergarten teacher, said everyone in the compound, a vocational training centre that now houses about 25,000 people, was terrified by the continuing bombardment in Gaza. The constant noise of airstrikes and reports of attacks close to shelters have sown panic.
“Of course we are frightened. We have our babies and children with us. Every parent in the world wants to protect their children and we cannot,” Hatib said. “My six-year-old daughter wants to know when she will go home so she can go back to reading and writing, which she loves. I try to give her hope and I say, ‘Of course you will go back to school,’ but I don’t know how this will be possible.”
A 37-year-old dentist who helps to run a basic primary healthcare station in the compound said she and others felt “totally lost”. “We have no homes. All the city is destroyed. Where will we go even if there is a ceasefire? We have lost everything and feel we have been abandoned here,” she said, requesting anonymity for security reasons.
Her healthcare station was struggling to cope. “It is very horrible. [It] is so crowded, and garbage is everywhere, and flies and insects. There are lots of infectious diseases now – skin and stomach problems. It is very hard for the mothers with newborns,” she said. “A lot of people are coming here with fractures or burns or just are shocked by what they have seen. Some have amputated legs and hands. I cannot say how horrible is this disaster. I never could dream such a nightmare.”
Sunday night’s Israeli bombardment of Gaza was one of the heaviest since the war began. In the north, where Gaza City and adjacent refugee camps are surrounded by Israeli ground forces, air and artillery strikes appeared to target the area around al-Shifa hospital.
Dr Marwan Abusada, the hospital’s head of surgery, said the situation was disastrous. “We have zero capacity. We have 153 patients at the ER. All the beds are occupied. We have no space for patients to go after they undergo surgery. We have a type of worms [in] the wounds after the surgery. Most injuries and surgeries have no follow-ups as the medical teams cannot cope with the influx of injuries every hour,” Abusada said in a statement transmitted to the Guardian by the NGO Medical Aid for Palestine.
The hospital’s usual capacity is 210, but staff are now trying to treat more than 800. About 150 medical personnel have been killed and there is a limited supply of food and water. The maternity ward has electricity and lights for only four hours a day, and only the ICU, emergency room and operating rooms have uninterrupted power, Abusada said.
Dr Tayseer Hassan, a surgeon at the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza, said patients were “on the floors … they are everywhere, next to doors, in hallways. The type of injuries we see are people who survived airstrikes and were pulled from under the rubble. So their bodies are scratched and bleeding. We do surgeries while the injuries are covered with flies. Nothing is clean, nothing is sterile. The whole hospital is full of blood and insects.”
In the south, where Israel has told all civilians to go for their own safety, more than 700,000 people are now crowded into shelters in schools and other facilities run by the UN, though exact numbers are unclear.
Private houses are also full of displaced people who have fled their own homes, and many new arrivals are sleeping in cars or tents. “I have been sleeping in my car for four weeks. My children sleep on the sand,” said the dentist in Khan Younis.
Outside Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, a tent city has emerged around parked vehicles, with plastic sheeting spread from car roofs to provide shade. People sleep or sit, charging phones from car batteries if they have fuel or from solar panels if they do not.
“The first moment I can’t forget is when I saw our house. It was targeted, destroyed and razed to the ground. That place where we used to be comfortable and secure was gone in a second,” Minna al-Qassas, 18, whose family are now living in their car, told Reuters.
Her family fled Gaza City and then stayed with relatives in Khan Younis, but their house was also bombed. “We came here hoping to find safety and security, but it doesn’t exist. When you sleep, you hear rockets overhead … People are scattered in the streets, some injured,” she said.
Not far away, Mohammad al-Qassas was living with his family under a plastic sheet strung from his car. Their home was destroyed in an airstrike and all the public shelters in UN-run schools were full, he said.
“Some sleep here on the bed, where we put mattresses, and some sleep down here on the ground. Some sleep on chairs, others lying down,” he said.
Nearly 1.5 million people have been displaced across the Gaza Strip since 7 October. The Israel Defence Forces have opened what they call “humanitarian corridors” to give civilians an opportunity to comply with instructions to leave the areas of the most violent fighting, but some have remained.
Outside al-Shifa hospital, Haneed Abdelhakim Saad said her family would not leave Gaza City despite the Israeli assault and demands for civilians to go. She fears that if they head to the south of the enclave, they will never be allowed back home.
“They can cut off the water, the electricity, the food, but we are staying,” she said. “This is what we want: to live in peace, to have our children go out without worrying about them.”
Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls for a ceasefire or humanitarian pause in the fighting, despite growing international pressure. The Israeli prime minister has said the Israeli offensive will continue until the 240 hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October are released.
Almost no humanitarian aid has reached Gaza in recent days, as agencies have been unable to deliver even the small amounts brought into the enclave from Egypt.
Hatib misses her kindergarten. “It is a beautiful nursery, full of beautiful kids, who all deserve to live,” she said.

Gaza: who lives there and why it has been blockaded for so long,2023-11-07,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/07/gaza-who-lives-there-and-why-it-has-been-blockaded-for-so-long,"Most people in the strip, once part of Palestine, are refugees or their descendants, expelled during the creation of Israel in 1948
The Gaza Strip, a narrow slice of land on the Mediterranean Sea, is the smaller of the two Palestinian territories, inhabited by approximately 2.3m Palestinians.
Historically part of the geographical region of Palestine, it was a vital coastal location for centuries, linking Asia with Europe, and has been controlled by the Ottoman and then the British empires and, more recently, been under Egyptian and Israeli military occupations.
The strip is wedged between the sea to the west, Israel to the north and east, and Egypt’s Sinai peninsula to the south. Gaza is geographically disconnected from the other Palestinian territory, the occupied West Bank, and Palestinians cannot freely travel between the two.
The vast majority of the Palestinians who live in Gaza are refugees or the descendants of refugees who moved to Gaza after being expelled or fleeing Zionist forces during the wars around the creation of Israel in 1948. Palestinians call that exodus the Nakba, or catastrophe. This is why many in Gaza object to being called Gazans, as it suggests they are from the strip and diminishes their rights as refugees to return to their homes.
Nearly half the people in Gaza live in refugee camps – tented communities that have become impoverished concrete slums. Most young people in Gaza have never left the territory.
Israel occupied Gaza during the 1967 war with its neighbours, taking it from Egyptian forces. Israeli troops remained there until 2005, when the then prime minister, Ariel Sharon, “disengaged”, withdrawing more than 8,000 Jewish settlers from the area. Sharon wanted instead to solidify Israel’s control of the “biblical heartlands” in the West Bank.
In 2006, the Islamist movement Hamas won a Palestinian election, leading to a rupture in Palestinian politics. Armed clashes broke out in Gaza between Hamas and militias linked to the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority, a secular body formed during failed international efforts to create a Palestinian state.
Since 2007, Hamas has been the de facto administration in Gaza and has ruled with an iron fist. However, Israel has never relinquished its overall control of the territory, and the UN considers Gaza still occupied. Israeli forces, in coordination with Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, have kept Gaza enclosed by land, air and sea.
People, food, fuel, internet, power and water cannot leave or enter Gaza without permission from Israel. Egypt has a land crossing in the south, Rafah, but in practice, the military regime in Cairo – an enemy of Hamas and ally with Israel’s most powerful backer, the US – acts as an enforcer of the blockade.
Israel says the blockade is for its own security, citing repeated Hamas rocket attacks and incursions. But UN experts say the blockade, and intense bombing during five wars on Gaza, amounts to collective punishment on civilians, a war crime under international law.
Human Rights Watch describes Gaza as an “open-air prison”.

Netanyahu’s vague vision for Gaza after war may open up new chapter of violence,2023-11-07,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/07/netanyahus-vague-vision-for-gaza-after-war-may-open-up-new-chapter-of-violence,"PM’s once unthinkable assertion Israel will reclaim security in territory would come with responsibilities towards Palestinians
The last time Israeli troops had a permanent security role inside Gaza, Israel’s prime minister was Ariel Sharon. Twenty-one Israeli settlements were scattered across the Gaza Strip, connected to Israel through a bypass road, used by Israeli surfers at the weekend to reach the coast.
Soldiers manned checkpoints and metal-clad towers. At night, Palestinian children would approach the towers under cover of darkness to throw crude pipe bombs that could be bought for pocket money.
For their part the armed factions in Gaza, Hamas among them, would attempt serious attacks including shootings and suicide bombings.
Now Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has suggested what many Israelis thought unthinkable: a return of security in Gaza to the Israeli administration, a place already half in ruins, with a population of 2.3 million.
“Israel will for an indefinite period have the overall security responsibly,” Netanyahu told ABC news on Monday, “because we have seen what happens when we do not have it.”
Exactly what Netanyahu has in mind remains unclear. Indeed, his comments appear to run contrary to assessments in the US and elsewhere that Israel – which militarily controlled Gaza from 1967 to 2005 – planned to reoccupy Gaza in any fashion and in any case would be opposed by Washington.
“Israel cannot reassume control and responsibility for Gaza,” the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said last week, adding it was his understanding that “Israel has made clear it has no intention or desire to do that”.
However, Netanyahu’s remarks follow statements by some other Israeli officials who have suggested Israel will need to maintain a military presence inside Gaza as a buffer to protect its civilians.
While Netanyahu has been vague about precisely what this could mean, reporting in the Hebrew media has suggested a rough shape.
The Israel Defence Forces and domestic security agency Shin Bet, it is suggested, would oversee security arrangements with the hope that other countries, not least in the Arab world, would help fund a humanitarian response.
The arrangement would remain until it was felt that the Israeli communities neighbouring Gaza were secure. These are all suggestions burdened with tremendous ifs.
One considerable problem is precisely how Israel would manage to separate any security arrangement on the ground from the wider legal obligations that arrangement would entail. When Israel withdrew troops from Gaza in 2005, it said it had ended its military rule and the occupation – while others, including a 2022 report by United Nations independent international commission of inquiry on the occupied Palestinian territory, said Gaza remained occupied through other means, including Israeli control over airspace, land crossings and governmental functions such as the management of the Palestinian population registry.
Under international humanitarian law, the prolonged presence of Israeli troops in Gaza would make the occupation of the coastal strip far more obviously concrete and place clear responsibilities on Israel as an occupying force, defined by it having effective control over the territories it is present in.
The fourth Geneva convention, for example, stipulates: “The occupying power has the duty to ensure that the adequate provision of food and medical supplies is provided, as well as clothing, bedding, means of shelter, other supplies essential to the survival of the civilian population of the occupied territory.”
And not everyone in Netanyahu’s cabinet has been relaying the same message.
For his part, Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has appeared to suggest exactly the opposite in terms of Gaza’s future administration: that after the fighting is completed in Gaza, Israel needs to end its involvement in responsibility for life in the territory.
And the story of Sharon’s unilateral disengagement from Gaza in 2005 is an instructive one for today’s Israeli leaders. Like Netanyahu, Sharon was a rightwing prime minister, an ally of the settlers and hugely sceptical about the peace process.
He saw the disengagement first and foremost as a security measure rather than a move in pursuit of the stalled Middle East peace process.
At its centre was the idea that reducing Israel’s civilian and military footprint in Gaza and elsewhere would reduce tensions that had recently been startlingly apparent during the second intifada. By quitting Gaza too, the calculation went, Israel would find it easier to pursue its policies of settlement on the West Bank.
With the disengagement, IDF installations and troops were removed and more than 9,000 Israeli citizens living in 21 settlements were evicted amid protests following a pre-2005 occupation of Gaza that had been costly both in terms of maintaining the Israeli military presence and in terms of lost soldiers’ lives.
Perhaps ironically, Netanyahu was among those who first supported disengagement as a cabinet minister, and then resigned over the issue when it became more politically expedient, saying he refused “to be a partner to a move which ignores reality, and proceeds blindly toward turning the Gaza Strip into a base for Islamic terrorism which will threaten the state”.
In the intervening period, the idea that Israel should fully occupy Gaza has not gone away, through war and blockade, as Hamas emerged as the strip’s ruler.
The rightwing politician Avigdor Lieberman, during his time as foreign minister, was one of those pushing for “a full occupation of the Gaza Strip” to end the threat of Hamas and its missiles.
And whatever Netanyahu’s vision, he may find it easier to win the war against Hamas than to extricate Israel from responsibility for the daily lives of Palestinians in Gaza. A formula, not for security, but rather a different chapter of violence.

Amnesty urges police not to ban pro-Palestinian march in London,2023-11-07,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/07/justice-secretary-alex-chalk-calls-for-armistice-day-pro-palestine-march-to-be-postponed,"Human rights body calls on Met not to bow to ‘political pressure’ over planned protest on Armistice Day
Amnesty International has called on the police in London not to bow to “political pressure” to ban this Saturday’s pro-Palestinian march in the city.
The human rights organisation also accused the home secretary, Suella Braverman, of “a dystopian distortion of the truth” for describing such protests as “hate marches”.
Amnesty’s intervention came as the Metropolitan police appeared to be on the brink of banning the march, saying a protest on Armistice Day would be inappropriate and risked violence, and as Conservative MPs brought fresh pressure to bear for the protest to be banned.
However, there was also a divergence from Braverman’s language by the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, who said those taking part included people peacefully expressing their “anguish at the untold suffering” in Gaza.
He told Sky News he did not believe the pro-Palestine march planned for Armistice Day should proceed and called on the organisers to listen to the call from the Met to postpone the demonstration.
He declined to endorse his colleague’s use of the term “hate marches”, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s also fair and reasonable to point out that there will be those on these marches who will not be consumed by illegality, are not calling for jihad and so on.”
Labour, meanwhile, continued to avoid taking an official position on whether the march should be banned as the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said it was an operational consideration for the police.
Cooper declined to say whether she believed the protest should be banned, but told Radio 4’s World at One: “We should support the police in their assessments and not this inflammatory rhetoric which is trying to to provoke people and trying to provoke divisions. Frankly, I think Suella Braverman is making it harder for the police to do their job rather than pulling communities together at a time of remembrance”
After a meeting between organisers of the protest and the Met, a statement was issued by Scotland Yard claiming that “the risk of violence and disorder linked to breakaway groups is growing”.
While most protests have passed off peacefully so far, police in Scotland are investigating an alleged assault on a veteran selling poppies at a station during a pro-Palestinian rally. Jim Henderson, 78, told the Scottish Daily Mail he was punched as he tried to leave Waverley Station in Edinburgh before being helped by railway staff.
Saturday’s protest is scheduled to start at 12.45pm at Marble Arch and end at the US embassy in south-west London, about two miles from the Cenotaph, where formal remembrance events will be held the next day.
The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which is organising the event, tweeted on Tuesday morning: “We will protest on Saturday as we have done ever since Israel’s savage assault on Gaza began, killing more than 10,000 people, including nearly 5,000 children.
“Our marches are peaceful, well-organised and a fundamental democratic right. See you on Saturday.”

‘We saw death’: families flee past tanks as Israel begins to storm Gaza City,2023-11-07,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/07/we-saw-death-families-flee-past-tanks-as-israel-prepares-to-storm-gaza-city,"Civilians given four-hour window to leave encircled capital but fears many are still trapped
Waving white flags and holding their hands above their heads, Palestinian families fled past tanks waiting to storm Gaza City in the next stage of the war that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said will give Israel “indefinite” control over the besieged territory.
Israel’s military gave civilians inside the encircled city a four-hour window to leave on Tuesday, as its forces prepared to retake the biggest city in the strip.
Men, women and children, some carrying their belongings on donkeys, fled their homes past Israeli troops out of the city.
In an Arabic-language message, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they would allow people to leave from 10am until 2pm local time, and published a video of dozens of people along a main road.
Posting online, one resident, Adam Fayez Zeyara, said the walk on Tuesday was the most dangerous of his life. “We saw the tanks from point blank. We saw decomposed body parts. We saw death.”
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said that Israeli forces were operating “in the heart of Gaza City” which he described as “the largest terrorist base ever built”.
Gallant also claimed that Hamas’ most senior leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, was isolated in his bunker, adding that the militant chief was “cut off from his surroundings, [and] his chain of command is weakening”.
Hundreds of thousands of people are feared to still be trapped in the city. Hamas, which has long used the tactic of hiding among civilians, has been accused of blocking people from leaving their homes.
Israel has repeatedly told civilians to move south for their own safety but continued to bomb the entire strip, striking the southern city of Khan Younis on Tuesday, killing 23 people according to Palestinian health officials.
A man rescued from the rubble of a house where medics said 11 people had been killed said that Israel would be “taught a very tough lesson”.
“This is the bravery of the so-called Israel, they show their might and power against civilians, babies inside, kids inside, and elderly.”
Nearly a month after Israel imposed a “complete siege” on Gaza, the World Health Organization said medical supplies were so low that doctors were performing operations, including amputations, without anaesthetic. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said Gaza was becoming a “graveyard for children”, calling for an urgent ceasefire.
Meanwhile, in Israel on Tuesday people held a minute’s silence to mark a month since the Hamas attack that killed 1,400 people in communities near the frontier and led to the current bombardment of Gaza.
The night before, a vigil in Jerusalem was held, with a candle lit for each victim.
Relatives of the dead gathered at Jerusalem’s Western Wall, where prayers were held to mark the first month of grief, in line with Jewish tradition. “We don’t have other ways to commemorate them except with prayers, lighting candles, and having them in our heart,” Yossi Rivlin, whose two brothers were killed at the music festival massacre during the Hamas attack.
Standing before a giant Israeli flag, the army’s chief cantor, Shai Abramson, gave a prayer for the dead, modified to include a blessing for security forces personnel who had died.
Israel’s bombardment in retaliation for the Hamas raid, in which fighters also seized 240 hostages, has killed more than 10,000 people, including about 4,100 children, according to Palestinian health officials.
Netanyahu, in comments that offered the clearest indication yet that Israel plans to keep a tight grip over the strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, has said his country will take “overall security responsibility” for Gaza.
Asked who should “govern” Gaza after the fighting ends, he told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Monday night: “Those who don’t want to continue the way of Hamas,” adding: “Israel will for an indefinite period … have the overall security responsibility because we’ve seen what happens when we don’t have that security responsibility.”
The White House reiterated on Tuesday that President Joe Biden does not support an Israeli reoccupation of the Gaza Strip after the war.
“The president still believes that a reoccupation of Gaza by Israeli forces is not good,” White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. “It’s not good for Israel; not good for the Israeli people.”
He added that there needed to be a “healthy set of conversations about what post-conflict Gaza looks like and what governance looks like” and that he would leave it to Netanyahu to clarify what he meant by “indefinite.”
The UN and other world bodies, including the EU, consider Gaza to be occupied – despite Israel withdrawing its forces from inside the strip in 2005 – as Israel has maintained effective control over the small territory by land, sea and air.
Netanyahu also said he would consider hour-long “tactical little pauses” in fighting to allow aid to enter or hostages to leave Gaza, but again rejected calls for a ceasefire.
Both Israel and Hamas have rebuffed mounting calls for a halt to fighting. Israel says hostages should be released first, while Hamas says it will neither free them nor stop fighting while Gaza is under assault.
Rights groups and UN experts have accused both sides of war crimes. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, began a five-day visit to the Middle East on Tuesday, although he had still not secured permission from Israel to visit.
“It has been one full month of carnage, of incessant suffering, bloodshed, destruction, outrage and despair,” Türk said in a statement. “Human rights violations are at the root of this escalation and human rights play a central role in finding a way out of this vortex of pain.”
International organisations have said Gaza’s hospitals cannot cope with the wounded, and food and clean water are running out, with aid deliveries nowhere near enough. “We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It’s been 30 days. Enough is enough. This must stop now,” said a statement from the heads of several UN bodies.
The UN security council met behind closed doors on Monday. The 15-member body is still trying to agree a resolution after failing four times in two weeks. Diplomats said a key obstacle was whether to call for a ceasefire, cessation of hostilities or humanitarian pauses to allow aid access in Gaza.

Israel fell silent on Tuesday to observe a minute’s silence to mark one month since the Hamas terrorist attacks that killed 1,400, mostly civilians at home and at a festival, and injured many more.
At 11am, people stood silently on the street and at schools, businesses and in cafes in Jerusalem and elsewhere, heads bowed. Some wept, others prayed or held hands.
Throughout the day thousands attended ceremonies held by public organisations and institutions. Schools, universities and youth movements arranged special lessons, lectures and other activities.
“Now there is a coming together, and you feel you belong to a community that cares and that is how I feel today,’ said Nava Ben-Or, a retired judge at a memorial outside the president’s official residence in Jerusalem. “This is not just for the bereaved but for everybody. We are all grieving.”
Outside the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, a crowd gathered for a vigil to remember the dead and the estimated 240 hostages still held by Hamas, the Islamist organisation that governs Gaza and was responsible for the attacks a month ago.
Ayaleth Katzit, 54, said she had come to show solidarity. “We are grieving. We are disappointed by our government which doesn’t know how to do its job in these hard times. The government is trying to divide us … but most Israelis are not like this,” Katzit said.
Yaakov Godo, 74, had travelled to the Knesset to confront politicians that he holds responsible for the death of his son, who was shot in his home on a kibbutz by Hamas attackers. His wife and three young daughters narrowly escaped.
“It has taken me a month to come to terms with the death of my son and my grief. There are many people like me and we have felt very alone, but there are many Israelis who do not want to be angry and want revenge by wiping out Gaza,” Godo said, standing in front of a row of portraits of missing hostages, who include infants, children and elderly people.
“It is very difficult for me to a pass a message that is so different to the message of revenge and anger. But I promised my son at his funeral that I would bring a message of peace and hope. That was my promise to him.”
The 7 October attacks came at moment of extreme political polarisation in Israel, exacerbated by the return to office of Benjamin Netanyahu last year at the head of a far-right coalition that has sought to undermine the country’s judicial system.
Polls now suggest that four in five people blame the Israeli government for the 7 October massacres and more than half want the Netanyahu to resign.
However, existing political and cultural battles have continued into the current crisis.
Near the Knesset rows of banners placed by relatives of the hostages, many of whom have called for negotiations with Hamas to secure the release of their loved ones, had been deliberately obscured by others that also demanded “no end” to the current Israeli offensive on Gaza until the “terrorists are exterminated, the area cleaned out and full control established”.
The Israeli offensive has killed more than 10,000 people in Gaza so far, including 4,000 children, according to local health authorities.
There is little sign of any widespread opposition to the campaign in Israel, and much support for frontline soldiers. Hundreds of thousands of ordinary Israelis remain mobilised.
One man shouted abuse at the small gathering of bereaved relatives and hostages’ families outside the Knesset, accusing them of being “leftist traitors”.
At Jerusalem’s Hebrew University about 1,000 people recited prayers and dozens attended a memorial at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, where a crowd wearing black lit rows of tealight candles commemorating the victims.
Sobs could be heard as they sang the “Hatikvah” national anthem – meaning “the hope” in Hebrew.
“No one has the right words,” said Adi Stern, the president of the academy. “We are all in despair, in horror. We want to add some hope.
“It’s extremely difficult but we have to do it,” he said.

Met police chief defies calls to ban pro-Palestine Armistice Day march in London,2023-11-07,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/07/no-grounds-to-ban-pro-palestine-march-in-london-on-armistice-day-met-believes,"Sir Mark Rowley says there is insufficient intelligence pointing to a risk of serious public disorder
Israel-Hamas war latest
The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has defied calls for a ban on a pro-Palestinian march through London on Armistice Day as he insisted on the independence of his force amid intense government pressure to act.
In a statement in which he acknowledged the demands for him to stop Saturday’s procession, Rowley insisted there was currently insufficient intelligence that there would be a risk of serious public disorder.
He stressed the importance of an “independent police service … focused simply on the law and the facts in front of us”, despite a chorus of cabinet ministers – including the home secretary and the justice secretary – insisting that the march should not go ahead.
While vowing “at all costs” to stop any disruption linked to the march, which falls on 11 November when the nation will hold a two-minute silence in commemoration of those who have died in conflict, Rowley said he would not act outside the law.
Under section 13 of the 1986 Public Order Act, a chief constable can apply to the home secretary to prohibit public processions to avoid serious public disorder.
Rowley said: “Many have called for us to use this power to ban a planned march by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign on Saturday.
“But the use of this power is incredibly rare and must be based on intelligence which suggests there will be a real threat of serious disorder and no other way for police to manage the event …
“Over recent weeks we’ve seen an escalation of violence and criminality by small groups attaching themselves to demonstrations, despite some key organisers working positively with us.
“But at this time, the intelligence surrounding the potential for serious disorder this weekend does not meet the threshold to apply for a ban.
“The organisers have shown complete willingness to stay away from the Cenotaph and Whitehall and have no intention of disrupting the nation’s remembrance events. Should this change, we’ve been clear we will use powers and conditions available to us to protect locations and events of national importance at all costs.”
Those attending the pro-Palestine marches in recent weeks have been calling for a ceasefire in the war that broke out last month after Hamas killed 1,400 people, mainly civilians, in Israel and took more than 200 hostages.
Thousands of civilians in Gaza have been killed in the Israeli military operation since, according to Gaza’s health authority, which is run by Hamas.
Saturday’s protest is scheduled to start at 12.45pm at Marble Arch and end at the US embassy in south-west London, about two miles from the Cenotaph, where formal remembrance events will be held the next day.
The police chief’s stance is likely to provoke anger in government where there had been an expectation that Rowley would ask the home secretary, Suella Braverman, for permission to prohibit the march. Ministers had been raising the prospect of disorder for days.
The Campaign Against Antisemitism on Tuesday night called for the home secretary to trigger draconian powers and even send in the army to “uphold the values that our country stands for”.
In a letter to Braverman, the group called on her to use powers under section 40 of the Police Act 1996 to ensure that this weekend’s protests are banned. The section allows the home secretary to step in when the police force is failing to discharge any of its functions in an effective manner.
Section 13 of the Public Order Act was last used in 2011 to stop a protest by the far-right English Defence League.
Home Office sources had said the risks of Saturday’s march included groups splintering off from the main procession, the danger of counter-protests clashing with pro-Palestine demonstrators and the unusual route of the march.
The founder of the EDL, Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had tweeted: “Saturday 11/11/11 London [a reference to the timing of the two-minute silence], your country needs you.”

Sources said the Met would keep seeking and assessing intelligence up until the weekend, and could still seek a ban if the threat reached what it viewed as the legal threshold.
Rowley said: “If over the next few days the intelligence evolves, and we reach a threshold where there is a real threat of serious disorder we will approach the home secretary. Right now, we remain focused on the facts in front of us and developing our plan to ensure the highest levels of protection for events throughout the weekend.”
In his statement, the Met commissioner added he understood the significance of this Remembrance weekend: “I completely recognise the significant public and political concern about the impact of ongoing protest and demonstrations on this moment of national reflection. Therefore I am determined we will do everything in our power to ensure they pass without disruption.
“The reason we have an independent police service is so that among debate, opinion, emotion and conflict we stand in the centre, focused simply on the law and the facts in front of us.
“The laws created by parliament are clear. There is no absolute power to ban protest, therefore there will be a protest this weekend.
“The law provides no mechanism to ban a static gathering of people. It contains legislation which allows us to impose conditions to reduce disruption and the risk of violence, and in the most extreme cases when no other tactics can work, for marches or moving protests to be banned.”
Gideon Falter, chief executive of Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: “If the Met is unable or unwilling to protect our freedoms and values this Remembrance Day weekend, we call on the home secretary to issue section 40 directives to force the Met into action, and call in the army to do what their predecessors did and uphold the values that our country stands for.”
Lawyers for the march organisers, led by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said they would study the grounds if a ban was sought ahead of launching a potential court battle by seeking a judicial review.
Braverman has described the pro-Palestine protests as “hate marches”. Critics of the home secretary have accused her of fuelling anger and the potential for trouble.
Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said Labour backed the police to make the right decision but suggested Braverman had been “encouraging people to exploit tensions and exploit situations and make them harder for the police to sort out”.
 This article was amended on 7 November 2023. In reporting on a letter from the Campaign Against Antisemitism, an earlier version referred to planned protests as “anti-Israel”; the CAA described the marches in these terms but the attribution was not made clear.

"Israel’s attempt to destroy Hamas will breed more radicalisation, UN expert says",2023-11-07,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/07/israels-attempt-to-destroy-hamas-will-breed-more-radicalisation-un-expert-says,"Francesca Albanese says crisis is result of failing to heed concerns about Israel’s repression of Palestinian human rights
Israel’s attempt to wipe out Hamas in response to the attacks of 7 October is likely to breed only further radicalisation, besides being unlawful, the UN special rapporteur on theoccupied Palestinian territories has said.
In an interview with the Guardian, Francesca Albanese also said the international community was “reaping the whirlwind” of failing to heed the concerns of those, including herself, who had criticised Israel’s “systematic repression of Palestinian human rights”.
“We raised the alarm in the international community, the human rights community, but no one has really listened,” Albanese said. “Now it has reached a dangerous point of no return where the chances of peaceful coexistence have dropped vertically off a cliff. In fact, we are staring into an abyss.”
Albanese, an Italian academic, has often been accused by Israel of displaying pro-Palestinian bias, a charge she denies.
She challenged Israel to consider what is in its own self-interest. “Half the infrastructure of Gaza has been destroyed. 9,000 people have been killed, 3,500 of them are reported to be children, over 1,000 of them are still under the rubble. How on earth is that going to lead to peace?”
She doubted it was possible to eradicate Hamas, which she described as “not just a military presence but a political reality”.
“Even if it was possible to eradicate Hamas, if [Israel] was to exterminate everyone, everyone, so not just the militants, but anyone who works for Hamas including service providers, even if that was possible, but Israel’s occupation remained in place, all the grievances would continue to grow and another resistance will emerge. It’s natural, it’s almost a law of physics. History confirms that.”
Her most recent report as UN special rapporteur was on children in the occupied territories, and she said she fears for the further psychological damage inflicted over the last month.
“When you see children there, a profound trauma has gone across their tiny bodies,” she said. “They can speak like adults, they speak of the rights, they speak of the world they know and the world they want. They live with fear, and their major fear is not to see their mother and father any more, either because they are killed or because the children themselves get killed.
“The parents of these kids say that they’re scared because they see what it is like for them, that there are fewer alternatives to armed resistance. And it’s difficult to keep the kids away from that path because so many hopes have been destroyed. … When they resist peacefully, and use international law such as the International criminal court or the international court of justice, the international community has been deaf. People feel left with nothing and this is a huge responsibility for the international community to reflect upon.”
Albanese said she feared the space was shrinking for voices that still cultivate peace.
“October 7 has thrown all of us out in an uncharted territory, it’s much murkier. Before October 7 those who advocated for Palestinian rights, including many Israelis, felt that the debate about apartheid was on the cusp of gaining legitimacy. Now that space has dropped vertically.
“Many of the civilians killed heinously by Hamas or taken hostage were from the left, and have been advocating for peace and respect for human rights for years.”
Albanese’s references to apartheid, occupation and description of the settlements as colonies have led to her being accused of being anti-Israeli. She says the term “settlements” for her is too neutral a word for an illegal act. She insists she is not an advocate for Palestinians, but for human rights, and justice for Israelis and Palestinians, while recognising the asymmetry in power, agency and responsibilities of the two sides.
The Israeli government has demanded her dismissal, labelling her language as hate-filled, that of an antisemite, and symptomatic of an anti-Israeli mindset that underplays the country’s legitimate security concerns. It refuses to cooperate with her as it has done so with her predecessors. She was appointed to a six-year term in 2022.
However much Israel abhors her, Albanese’s arguments have gained traction and a wide audience in Arab and parts of the western media.
She argues that Israel cannot invoke the right to self-defence under the UN charter since the threat comes not from a state, but a military group, in a territory that Israel occupies militarily. Israel rejects the idea that it has occupied Gaza since withdrawing its forces in 2005, but the UN and other global bodies consider the occupation to have continued since then as it has maintained effective control over the small territory by land, sea and air.
She said that even if Israel did have a right to invoke self-defence, the attack on Gaza could not be justified under the law of war. “The attacks are clearly indiscriminate, disproportionate and violate the principle of precaution. One cannot bomb hospitals hosting hundreds of patients and sheltering thousands of refugees. Sorry, we need to look for another solution, and not to bomb hospitals. Absolutely not. This is criminal.”

Netanyahu says Israel will have ‘overall security responsibility’ in Gaza after war,2023-11-07,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/07/netanyahu-israel-consider-tactical-pauses-gaza,"Prime minister rules out general ceasefire as Israel marks a month since Hamas attack
Israel will keep control over Gaza indefinitely after its war against Hamas ends, Benjamin Netanyahu has stated, saying his country will take “overall security responsibility” for the territory.
One month after Hamas’s attack killed 1,400 people, the Israeli prime minister also said he would consider hour-long “tactical little pauses” in fighting to allow the entry of aid or the exit of hostages from the Gaza Strip, but again rejected calls for a ceasefire.
Asked who should “govern” Gaza after fighting ends, Netanyahu told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Monday night: “Those who don’t want to continue the way of Hamas.”
He added: “Israel will for an indefinite period … have the overall security responsibility [in Gaza] because we’ve seen what happens when we don’t have that security responsibility.”
His comments offered the clearest indication yet that Israel plans to keep a tight grip over the territory that is home to 2.3 million Palestinians.
The United Nations and other world bodies, including the EU, consider Gaza as occupied – despite Israel withdrawing its forces from inside the strip in 2005 – as it has maintained effective control over the small territory by land, sea and air.
Israel’s military re-entered Gaza last week and has encircled the densely populated Gaza City, where the Hamas Islamist group is hiding among civilians. The army said early on Tuesday that it had taken a Hamas compound and was poised to attack fighters hiding in underground tunnels.
Health officials in Gaza said at least 23 Palestinians were killed in two separate Israeli airstrikes early on Tuesday in southern Gaza – areas to where Israel has told civilians to flee.
In the city of Khan Younis, a man rescued from the rubble of a house where medics said 11 people had been killed warned that Israel would be “taught a very tough lesson”.
“This is the bravery of the so-called Israel, they show their might and power against civilians, babies inside, kids inside, and elderly,” the man told reporters.
On Tuesday, a month since Hamas’s attack in southern Israel, people held a minute of standing silence across Israel to commemorate the victims.
The night before, a vigil in Jerusalem was held, with a candle lit for each victim.
Relatives of the dead gathered at Jerusalem’s Western Wall where prayers were held marking the first month of grief, in line with Jewish tradition. “We don’t have other ways to commemorate them except with prayers, lighting candles, and having them in our heart,” Yossi Rivlin, whose two brothers were killed at a music festival massacre during the Hamas attack.
Standing before a giant Israeli flag, the army’s chief cantor, Shai Abramson, gave a prayer for the dead, modified to include a blessing for security forces personnel who had died.
Retaliating to the Hamas raid, in which fighters seized 240 hostages, Israel has bombarded the enclave in an assault that Gaza health officials say has killed more than 10,000 Palestinians, including about 4,100 children.
Both Israel and Hamas have rebuffed mounting calls for a halt in fighting. Israel says hostages should be released first. Hamas says it will neither free them nor stop fighting while Gaza is under assault.
Rights groups and UN experts have accused both Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, began a five-day visit to the Middle East on Tuesday, although he had still not secured permission from Israel to visit.
“It has been one full month of carnage, of incessant suffering, bloodshed, destruction, outrage and despair,” Turk said in a statement. “Human rights violations are at the root of this escalation and human rights play a central role in finding a way out of this vortex of pain.”
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said Gaza is becoming a “graveyard for children”, calling for an urgent ceasefire.
International organisations have said Gaza’s hospitals cannot cope with the wounded, and food and clean water are running out with aid deliveries nowhere near enough. “We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It’s been 30 days. Enough is enough. This must stop now,” said a statement from the heads of several United Nations bodies.
On Monday, the Israeli military released video of tanks moving through bombed-out streets and groups of troops moving on foot. It says it has surrounded Gaza City, cutting off northern parts of the narrow coastal strip from the south.
The UN security council met behind closed doors on Monday. The 15-member body is still trying to agree a resolution after failing four times in two weeks to take action. Diplomats said a key obstacle was whether to call for a ceasefire, cessation of hostilities or humanitarian pauses to allow aid access in Gaza.
When asked on Monday if there had been any talks at the UN yet about what might happen in Gaza once the fighting stopped, the deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, told reporters: “Obviously there is concern about what happens the day after, but we’re not at that point.”

Imran Hussain: Labour frontbencher resigns in support of Gaza ceasefire,2023-11-08,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/08/imran-hussain-labour-frontbencher-resigns-gaza-ceasefire,"Shadow minister says his position on Gaza is at odds with Keir Starmer’s call for humanitarian pauses
A member of Labour’s frontbench has resigned “with a heavy heart” over the party’s position on the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Imran Hussain, MP for Bradford East, said he could no longer “sufficiently in all good conscience” serve as a shadow levelling up minister as he wanted to be a strong advocate for a ceasefire.
“Over recent weeks, it has become clear that my view on the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza differs substantially from the position you have adopted,” Hussain said in a resignation letter to the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, published on social media.
“A ceasefire is essential to ending the bloodshed, to ensuring that enough aid can pass into Gaza and reach those most in need, and to help ensure the safe return of the Israeli hostages.”
He said he had been proud to work alongside Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, in developing a plan for employment rights, but could not “in all good conscience” push for a cessation of hostilities while remaining part of the frontbench.
Since the Guardian reported about the first 20 councillors who were ready to quit the party last month over Starmer’s comments on LBC and the party’s position, many frontbenchers who represent constituencies with large Muslim communities had been on resignation watch. Those constituencies included Birmingham, Bradford, Manchester and Leeds.
Despite Starmer’s efforts to clarify the comments he made during an LBC interview in which he said Israel “has the right” to withhold power and water from Gaza, Hussain said the party leader’s comments had left him “deeply troubled”.
I want to be able to strongly advocate for a ceasefire, as called for by the UN General Secretary. In order to be fully free to do so, I have tonight stepped down from Labour's Frontbench. My letter below: pic.twitter.com/u47KMVNhxt
“I have unequivocally condemned Hamas’s attacks of 7 October and I firmly agree that every country has the right to defend itself. This however can never become a right to deliberately violate international law on protecting civilians or to commit war crimes,” he wrote.
Hussain ultimately wants the party to go further and call for a ceasefire, and he is joined by at 15 other Labour frontbenchers who have either called for a ceasefire or shared others’ demands for a ceasefire on social media, including Yasmin Qureshi and Jess Phillips.
Asked if Labour MPs had been told not to attend pro-Palestine marches this weekend, the shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “We’ve been told we need to be careful that we don’t end up alongside people where there may be banners or language being used that is unacceptable, and sadly there have been incidents on some of these marches where that has happened. I appreciate that it’s not the majority of people who want to demonstrate.”Pressed on Hussain’s views on whether Israel had breached international law, Phillipson said all Labour MPs “have to tread with a degree of caution”, adding that “Imran has reached his own decision”.
Starmer had sought on Friday to portray the party as unified in its position on the Israel-Hamas conflict, insisting that calls for a ceasefire and humanitarian pauses were “coming from the same place”.
Hussain’s resignation puts Starmer’s leadership under strain. A number of senior Labour MPs do not feel his comments on the Middle East conflict this week have done enough to “hold the parliamentary Labour party together”, given the “level of anger within Labour’s grassroots”.
The Labour leader has argued that a ceasefire would freeze the status quo and that Hamas’s murder of 1,400 people on 7 October and the group’s stated intention to strike again and again makes this untenable.
Starmer has followed the White House in calling for humanitarian pauses to allow aid to get into Gaza. Labour backs a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.
Senior Labour figures, including the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, have also challenged Starmer’s stance.
The Labour leader of Burnley borough council resigned along with 10 other councillors in protest at Starmer’s refusal to call for a ceasefire; while at least 330 Labour councillors have signed a letter urging Starmer to back a ceasefire.
The Labour leadership has sought to toughen its line towards Israel. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, after visiting the region, said the “number of dead Palestinian civilians and children is shocking” as he called on Israel to take further steps to stop a “humanitarian catastrophe”, including a pause in the fighting.
Lammy said Israel “must uphold international law” and also warned of violence in the West Bank.

‘Why didn’t we die together?’: the last survivors of three Gaza families speak,2023-11-08,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/08/gaza-palestine-family-israel-airstrike-survivors,"Israeli airstrikes have leveled thousands of homes, killing entire families. Wafa Aludaini, reporting from Gaza, meets those left behind
In Gaza, many branches of one family often share a home. Grandparents, aunts and uncles become like second parents to children. Cousins become like siblings. Family members care for each other’s kids, changing diapers, feeding them, making sure they get to and from school. In moments of crisis and uncertainty, they evacuate together, worry together, grieve together.
For the 33rd day, Israeli bombs and missiles have rained down on the besieged Gaza Strip, after the 7 October attack by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups killed 1,400 Israelis and took more than 240 people hostage or prisoner. The death toll in Gaza reached more than 10,000 people on Monday, according to the Palestinian ministry of health. Israel’s government says it will not consider a ceasefire unless the hostages are freed as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens by the hour.
By the 31st day of Israeli airstrikes, a ministry of health spokesperson said that 1,200 Palestinian families had their homes destroyed, and that dozens of families were removed from Gaza’s population registry altogether. But in some families, a member or two does survive, who must learn to go on alone after painful and sudden loss. The Guardian spoke to some of these last survivors during the third week of the war.
Rushdiyya Toutah is a 43-year-old wheelchair user from Gaza City, in the north of Gaza. On 17 October, she sat in the yard at the al-Ahli Arab hospital, surrounded by other displaced people who sought refuge there. An hour later, a blast killed nearly 500 of them, according to Palestinian officials. (Israeli and US intelligence officials say the death count was much lower.) That included every adult member of Toutah’s family. Once she learned the fate of her loved ones, she could only cry out: “Why, why I am here? I need to go with them. We were always together, why didn’t we die together?”
Earlier in the day, Toutah said her eldest brother alerted the family to airstrikes near their home and insisted they all evacuate to a safer place. Toutah and one of her sisters are mobility-impaired, which meant it would have been nearly impossible for them to hurry out of their home in time to escape an impending strike. And in the event of a surprise attack, they would not have been able to pull themselves out of the rubble.
So the whole family, nearly 40 members in all, headed towards the hospital. “We felt safe,” Toutah said. “There were thousands of people and kids.” Her brothers set up tents for everyone in the yard, and they settled in as they listened to Israeli warplanes fly overhead.
Then, horror struck: “All I remember is that the kids said that they were hungry, so their mothers started making sandwiches for them after asking them to go to play in the yard,” Toutah said. “I saw them laughing and playing while their mothers were happy, preparing the food. Then I found myself covered in others’ blood in al-Shifa hospital, where the rescuer and the paramedics took me.”
Toutah’s parents, her two brothers, their wives and her disabled sister were all killed. Of the children in her family, only a nephew, Yamen, survived. Toutah somehow made it through, although with significant injuries: “I felt pain in all my body parts, and I could barely even see, as my eyes were hurting.” She says they were exposed to intense flames. Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike caused the explosion, while US intelligence agencies and Israel claim the strike was the result of a malfunctioning missile launched from within Gaza.
Toutah has another sister who is married and living elsewhere in Gaza City. Because al-Shifa hospital was overrun with the injured and quickly running out of supplies, her sister wanted Toutah to leave with her. Toutah hesitated.
“It was a difficult and risky choice. I asked: ‘What if they bomb us again?’ But my sister insisted: ‘We have no choice but to face our destiny,’” she said. “I am now trapped in the home of my sister, where the house is shaking every single moment there is a massive explosion. Now, my sister is taking care of me along with my little nephew, Yamen, who is also a sole survivor.”
Eighteen-year-old Dima al-Lamdani dreamed of being a successful businesswoman while growing up in the Shati refugee camp. When Israel’s military warned on 13 October that everyone in the north of Gaza should evacuate south, Lamdani’s father called his brother, and all of them, several generations of an extended family, decided to flee the camp. They took temporary refuge in the home of a family friend, carrying enough fuel with them to fill generators to charge their phones and LED lights.
Two days later at dawn, Lamdani sat with her aunt drinking coffee, unable to sleep. The next thing she remembers, she was covered in rubble with the sounds of people shouting all around her. Nearly 50 people were in the residential building, including 17 members of Lamdani’s family. Lamdani, her brother, and her two younger cousins, who were pulled from the rubble of the house, were the only survivors. “The time I spent waiting to be found were some of the most horrifying moments. I was about to lose my mind. I screamed and cried when they found me,” Lamdani said.
Lamdani was then brought to a mortuary where she had to identify the bodies of her loved ones. “I could hardly recognise them, as their facial features changed. I bawled and begged: ‘Please don’t leave me alone. I can’t live without you!’” she said. Just the week before, they had been making plans for her future. “I told them I will be a popular person and businesswoman and that they will all come to beg to work with me. I was joking to make them laugh.”
Lamdani’s two cousins are now in her care, and she wonders how she will go on. “I am crumbled now. No dreams, no hopes, no plans. I can’t imagine my life without my mother and sister and father,” she said. “The Israeli forces betrayed us. There is no place that is safe.”
Samah Aladini is grieving for her lost daughter, whose home in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza was hit without warning by an Israeli airstrike on 24 October. Nai’emah, her six-year-old granddaughter, survived the strike and is now in her grandmother’s care. “I remember my slain daughter. How can her little daughter live without parents?” Aladini said.
As Nai’emah sits in Aladini’s lap, she recalled how her mother was sleepy, but she knew Nai’emah loved fried potatoes so she cooked in spite of her fatigue. Her paternal grandmother was praying and her grandfather was listening to the news on the radio. The last thing Nai’emah remembered is that he called her and her siblings over to give them all something – a treat, maybe. The strike that followed killed Nai’emah’s parents, paternal grandparents and siblings.
“I still don’t know what my grandfather wanted to give us. I dreamed of him yesterday, that he gave me a doll, but the doll was scary and I ran away,” Nai’emah said.
Aladini wants her granddaughter to have access to therapy, as she isn’t eating. “We will have to wait until the war ends, if we survive, to treat her,” she said.

‘Handed a death sentence’: UK doctor forced to return to Gaza from Egypt,2023-11-08,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/08/uk-doctor-forced-to-return-to-gaza-from-egypt-ahmed-sabra,"Foreign Office accused of ‘grotesque failure’ as Dr Ahmed Sabra says he and other UK nationals have been sent back over border
A British consultant cardiologist based in Swansea has said he is being “handed a death sentence” after being forced to return to Gaza over the border from Egypt at the Rafah crossing on Wednesday.
Dr Ahmed Sabra said: “I am making a desperate appeal to the public that hold British values to help us. We are being handed a death sentence. Gaza is the most dangerous place in the world.
“The staff from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office that are supposed to help us at the Rafah crossing have vanished.”
Sending a series of emotional voice notes as he was being forced back over the border in a bus, he said he and another small group of British nationals were being forced back over the border even though they had been allowed to cross by Palestinians in Gaza along with the rest of his family. He had been visiting Gaza with his wife and three children.
Palestinian officials in Gaza had permitted him to cross with his family even though, unlike his family, he was not the approved list, and after three days on the Egyptian side waiting for the process to be complete, he was ordered back.
The approved list is drawn up by Egypt and Israel, and it is not clear why he and other British nationals had been excluded from travelling with the rest of their families.
He said he had been told “the British embassy had not followed the clear process to put him on the approved list”, and he could not understand why families were being divided.
He said: “At least my family is safe and they have been allowed to enter Egypt.” He said his wife and family had reached Cairo.
“I hope my friends, my colleagues in the hospital and my patients can do something. I feel almost like the Foreign Office wanted me to go back, or just did the minimum.”
Admitting he was deeply distressed and angry, he said he had been waiting for a month to get out. “We have seen and smelt death every day, we have heard death every day, and we felt like we died 100 times.”
“I feel like a second class citizen. They dealt with Ukrainians and Afghans better than us.
Speaking through tears, he said he was concerned not just for himself but the thousands of Palestinians who had been killed. He asked: “How can anyone be so heartless as to say the number dead is not accurate. I think the number is understated. There are so many in the rubble. I have been to the hospitals. I know how they work and most medical services have been stopped. People with heart attacks are not being treated. I think the death toll is much higher.”
Geraint Davies, the independent MP for Swansea West, has been battling to get Sabra and his family out of Gaza for more than two weeks.
He said: “This is more than a grotesque failure by the FCDO, who are directly complicit, according to the Egyptians in him being sent back to danger. I have been in touch with No 10, alongside the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, and Lord Ahmad [Middle East minister] directly.
“The government’s first duty is to protect their citizens and they have allowed Dr Sabra potentially to be sent to his death. Much more was done for non-UK nationals escaping from enemies in Kabul than for Dr Sabra, who was already in the British embassy’s care.”
A UK foreign office spokesman said: “We’re working round the clock to ensure all British nationals in Gaza who want to leave are able to.
“This involves submitting all details of British nationals and eligible dependents to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities. The authorities then review all cases and give permissions to cross.
“We remain in regular contact with British nationals in Gaza to provide them with the latest information, and UK teams are forward deployed to the border to receive anyone leaving”.

‘We can’t ignore these people’: huge surge in numbers fleeing Gaza City,2023-11-08,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/08/thousands-flee-gaza-under-watch-israeli-tanks,"Torrent of people carrying children, helping elderly relatives, holding possessions in carrier bags head south
On Salah al-Din, the broad main highway that runs along the Gaza Strip, the trickle of those fleeing on foot from Israel’s war against Hamas has become a torrent, with about 15,000 people attempting to make the perilous journey on Wednesday.
Under white flags, and carrying a few possessions mainly in carrier bags, exhausted parents led their children on Wednesday or carried them under the watch of Israeli tanks as the sounds of war rang out in the near distance.
On Sunday, 2,000 people took the opportunity to flee south during a daily four-hour window announced by the Israel Defence Forces. On Monday it was 5,000.
By Tuesday the daily column trudging south had swelled to 15,000, according to the United Nations, moving towards an area offering a haven of only marginally more safety as Israeli strikes continued to hit locations in the south of Gaza.
On Wednesday the scale of the movement prompted the IDF to extend the period of the “safe corridor” by an extra hour “in reaction to [Palestinians] sizeable response” to Israel’s call for them to use the corridor to flee.
Those fleeing include children, older people and people with disabilities, and most walked with minimal belongings, the UN agency said.
Many of those on the road had started their journey earlier in the day in areas such as Gaza City’s al-Rimal, gathering in family groups or with neighbours to begin their walk, with some saying they had to cross Israeli checkpoints, where they saw people being arrested.
Clutching one of her toddlers, Amira al-Sakani told AFP she fled Gaza City after coming across the airdropped Israeli flyers.
“Our life is tragic,” she said. “We don’t want war. We want peace.”
Ameer Ghalban, who pushed an older relative in a wheelchair, said the two of them had each lived off one piece of bread a day for the past three days. “The majority of people have left their land because the siege has become absolute in Gaza. We have no water, no electricity, and no flour.”
“We don’t know where we’re going,” Naseem al-Dada, carrying one of his children, told the BBC, with the sound of a drone audible overhead. “We’re heading south as they told us to do. We are walking and we don’t know where we’ll go. To the [UN] schools? To sleep on the streets. To sleep at someone’s house? God only knows.”
With numbers on the road on Wednesday estimated to be similar to Tuesday, reports suggested some of those escaping south had been driven out of al-Shati refugee camp on the coast, on the very frontline of the Israeli advance.
From there they had tried to find shelter first at the overcrowded Dar al-Shifa hospital before deciding to keep moving farther south, with video showing large numbers walking through the streets of a Gaza City empty of cars.
Hamas indicated it was opposed to the ongoing evacuation, accusing the UN of colluding with the Israeli military in the “forced displacement” of residents of Gaza.
“UNRWA [the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency] and its officials bear responsibility for this humanitarian catastrophe, in particular the residents of the Gaza [City] area and north of it,” said Salama Maruf, head of the media bureau of Hamas.
While many Palestinians escaped earlier in the war, those taking to the roads now account for about 350,000 people trapped within the Israeli cauldron, battered by intense and continuous daily airstrikes and tank and other fire that have crept closer as Israeli forces have advanced.
In a video clip released by the IDF, the procession of those fleeing can be seen moving through a sandy landscape bordered by war-damaged buildings.
Against a background rumble of motors from the watching armoured vehicles, shots and booms are audible.
Moving quickly in sight of the Israeli guns, some glancing anxiously across, many had hands raised in the air, or held up T-shirts, sheets and pillow cases as makeshift white flags, conscious that others who have fled along this road have been killed in unclear circumstances.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which said one of its humanitarian convoys in Gaza was hit by gunfire on Tuesday, demanded an end to the suffering of civilians.
The ICRC’s president, Mirjana Spoljaric, said: “Children have been ripped from their families and held hostage. In Gaza, ICRC surgeons treat toddlers whose skin is charred from widespread burns.”
What they are escaping from was described in graphic terms on Wednesday by the ICRC’s spokesperson, Alyona Synenko, in Jerusalem. “There are civilians in the north and in Gaza City. They are people who don’t have food, access to basic necessities and, most importantly, who can’t find any place to be safe. We can’t just ignore these people.
“They are still there and they urgently need humanitarian assistance. Making sure there is humanitarian space so people can receive essential supplies is also an obligation under international humanitarian law,” said Synenko.
The UN’s main humanitarian office painted an equally desperate picture, with no bakeries operating in northern Gaza after looting of the last three remaining.
Tens of thousands of others still remain inside the encircled area, many sheltering at hospitals or UN schools, including at Gaza City’s main al-Shifa hospital, where Um Haitham Hejela was sheltering with her young children in an improvised tent.
“The situation is getting worse day after day,” she told Reuters. “There is no food, no water. When my son goes to pick up water, he queues for three or four hours in the line. They struck bakeries, we don’t have bread.”
The north has been without running water for weeks, and the UN aid office said the last functioning bakeries shut down on Tuesday for lack of fuel, water and flour.
Majed Haroun, who lives in Gaza City, said women and children go door to door asking for food, while those in shelters rely on local donations.
The situation for those fleeing, however, is only little better in the south, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people are packed into makeshift shelters including one where, according to the UN, 600 people must share a single toilet.
On Wednesday an Israeli air raid targeted the eastern side of Khan Younis in al-Zana, destroying a home and killing four people, one a little girl.

 Gaza diary part 18: ‘How many people are we going to lose before we get out of this nightmare?’,2023-11-08,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/08/gaza-diary-part-18-how-many-people-are-we-going-to-lose-before-we-get-out-of-this-nightmare,"Ziad, a 35-year-old Palestinian, recounts another day in Gaza as news arrives of the death of a good friend and his family in Gaza City
My friend has no name.
I met him during a difficult period of my life. I had started a new job and was not sure I was ready to return to work. But his presence was all I needed. After the first week I sent him a message thanking him for being a very kind and helpful person.
My friend was a great father of two girls. In the conservative society we live in, he faced pressure for not having a boy. At social occasions, some people would wish him a boy to “hold your name”. However, he was extremely happy and proud of his daughters. He told me several times that they were more than enough, they were the biggest gift he had ever received. He wanted them to be strong and independent. At work, they would call him to discuss anything, I would hear him telling them how much he loved them.
People in the office called us “the duo” or “the buddies”. We would spend our breaks together, talking and laughing, discussing issues important and silly. He had a unique laugh. One time I told him that I was planning to buy a mug for myself. The next day, a nice mug appeared in my office, a gift from him. And every time we went on a break, he would laugh about me using the “mug he bought with his own money”. Even after I left for another job, I took his mug with me, and I would send him messages from time to time, wishing we could share a break together.
My friend loved helping others. Every month, he would buy chicken, vegetables and other food items from his salary and give them to poor families. At work, he never hesitated to help colleagues; he did not care about rivalries or showing off his skills. Everyone spoke fondly of him.
Once a month, we would go walking together for an hour or two. Not for the exercise, but for the opportunity to have one of the wonderful discussions we used to share.
Two weeks ago, he sent me a message to say he was looking for a place to move. “We cannot handle the displacement in schools or at hospitals. I need any decent place to take my family. Otherwise, I won’t be able to leave Gaza City.” There were no places left. The last message from him was a couple of days ago: he told me how tired he was and how surviving every day is a miracle.
My sister hears the news from someone in her social circle. I immediately call a mutual friend, who calms me down and tells me that it was not him: “It cannot be him, I have spoken to him recently,” she says. I try to call his mobile, but cannot reach him.
Fifteen minutes later, I receive a call from her, crying: “It might be him.”
An hour later, it is confirmed. My friend, his wife and his two daughters are no longer alive.
I do not cry; not one tear falls. I call our mutual friend again and I tell her that great people like him will live in our memories. We will always talk about what a wonderful person and father he was.
After we end the call, I go to the balcony and I try to call him again. Maybe it was a rumour, hopefully it was a bad joke. Please, be alive. Please, be alive.
I don’t know how I feel.
Yesterday, we were able to wash our clothes by hand. I go upstairs to the roof, take the laundry down. It is not even dry but I do not care. I fold the laundry.
I stand up, look at the room: there are lots of things that needed to be changed and moved. My sister says nothing. I rearrange the whole room.
I need to breathe. I need to be alone. During these horrible times, you cannot be alone. You have no space to process feelings, you cannot even grieve a dead person.
I go to the toilet, close the door and sit on the floor. I can’t cry, and I can’t breathe either. I calm myself and go out.
I find the children in our room. They speak about everything. The youngest plays at being mother and prepares peas and cakes for her “children”; the middle one speaks about wanting to travel like his cousin did and “see the world”; the oldest speaks about the gifts she received from her aunt when she was abroad.
I listen, and can’t stop thinking about my friend’s daughters. I was sure, and I always told him, that people who were raised well like his daughters are the positive seed of the future. Children like them are the ones who make this world a better place. Unfortunately, they never had the chance.
Hearing about people that you don’t know dying is one thing, but losing someone close to you; someone you shared secrets with; someone whose energy would shine … this is one of the most awful things you can go through.
How many people are we going to lose before we get out of this nightmare? How many dreams will die? How many more great people stolen from their loved ones?
My friend died in Gaza City. I cannot be there for his funeral. Will he have a decent burial? Or will his and his family’s bodies be left until the whole situation is over. I will not be able to hug his loved ones and tell them how sorry I am.
My friend has no name because my friend is everyone’s friend. He is the kind colleague at work, the great father you see in the park, and the helpful person in any community.
I wonder how scared my friend was. Was he hugging his girls when they all died?

"‘It’s one of the fundamental issues of our time’: Ben Jamal, the man behind London’s pro-Palestine march",2023-11-08,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/08/details-of-pro-palestine-march-in-london-agreed-with-police-says-organiser,"The son of a Palestinian vicar from west Jerusalem and an English mother has helped bring hundreds of thousands of people on to the capital’s streets
“By and large, it’s all been resolved,” said Ben Jamal, the director of the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign (PSC), of his latest meeting with the Metropolitan police about the pro-Palestine march due to take place on Armistice Day in central London.
A “very long meeting” with officers on Wednesday morning had “focused on ironing out the final details of logistics”. There would be just one final discussion to confirm the precise finishing point of Saturday’s procession from Marble Arch to Nine Elms, close to the US embassy, he said.
“It was a pause in very necessary conversations,” said Jamal of Tuesday, a rather different sort of day when he and representatives of the other five groups organising the protests could not get a meeting with the Met, as the force went into a tailspin over calls for the march to be banned.
The Met police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, had only emerged after dark to say that he could see no grounds for a ban, adding: “The organisers have shown complete willingness to stay away from the Cenotaph and Whitehall and have no intention of disrupting the nation’s remembrance events”. After an emergency meeting between Rowley and Rishi Sunak on Wednesday, the prime minister confirmed that the march will go ahead, despite calls for him to overule the Met.
Jamal, 60, the son of a Palestinian Anglican vicar from west Jerusalem and an English mother who met in Nazareth, has been the director of the PSC for seven years.
In his role as the leading official in Europe’s largest Palestinian rights organisation, he has taken a main role in organising the marches that have brought hundreds of thousands of people on to London’s streets.
A former social worker at a domestic violence charity, he said he joined the PSC in recognition “that this is one of the fundamental issues of our time”.
“The military occupation and the enduring oppression of the Palestinian people, the PSC has recognised for a long time, but a consensus is spreading across civil society, recognising it as a system of apartheid,” he said.
The demand of those marching has been for a ceasefire in the war, which broke out after Hamas’s killing on 7 October of 1,400 people in Israel and seizure of about 240 hostages.
There will be many who disagree with Jamal and the five other groups coordinating on the protests: the Muslim Association of Britain, Friends of Al-Aqsa, Palestinian Forum in Britain, Stop the War and CND.
There have been “unacceptable” things said by some of those attending the protests and indeed written by members of the PSC (four individuals in Manchester have been suspended for describing Hamas gunmen as resistance fighters). But, as Rowley’s comments on Tuesday evening highlighted, Jamal has shepherded his organisation through some choppy waters.
Representatives of the six organisations are meeting almost daily online to plan. It was during one of those meetings two weeks ago that the organisers alighted on the fact that one of their Saturday marches would coincide with Armistice Day. A new route was proposed to the Met to avoid the Cenotaph.
There will no doubt be more troubles along the way. “We will need to call weekly demonstrations,” Jamal said, “at the very least until a ceasefire is called”.
 This article was amended on 9 November 2023. A typographical error meant that, on fourth mention, an earlier version referred to the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign as the “PCS”, rather than “PSC”.

Criticism of Israel exposes generational and ideological rifts in Democratic party,2023-11-08,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/08/democrat-opinion-israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire-support,"Some US progressives call for ceasefire while others continue to staunchly support Israel’s actions, seemingly splitting the group
In the days after Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from Gaza, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostages, nearly every elected Democratic official vowed unwavering support for Israel and its right to self-defense. Those who did not were condemned swiftly and unequivocally by their fellow Democrats, Republicans and the White House.
Now one month into the war, as Israeli troops intensify their ground invasion of Gaza and the Palestinian death toll surpasses 10,000, of which more than 4,100 are children, according to the health ministry in Gaza, Democrats are in turmoil, divided over the American response to the conflict. As calls for a ceasefire gain traction among their supporters, Democrats are split between those increasingly more critical of Israel’s response to the terrorist attacks and those who are doubling down on unrestricted support for Israel.
Those fissures tore open on the House floor on Tuesday, where 22 Democrats joined nearly all Republicans to formally rebuke the chamber’s lone Palestinian American, the Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, for her rhetoric about Israel’s war in Gaza.
The shift in tone and substance is notable in Washington, where support for Israel is one of the few sentiments shared deeply by both parties. Even as left-leaning voters, especially young progressives, have grown increasingly critical of Israel, the vast majority of elected Democrats count themselves as staunch allies of the Jewish state. In the wake of 7 October, sympathy for Israel spiked among Democrats.
While still pledging unambiguous support for Israel, Biden administration officials and leading Democrats in Congress have started to deliver increasingly urgent warnings about Israel’s military operations and the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
​​“The current rate of civilian death inside Gaza is unacceptable and unsustainable,” Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator from Connecticut and an influential member of the foreign affairs committee, said in a statement last week. “I urge Israel to immediately reconsider its approach and shift to a more deliberate and proportionate counter-terrorism campaign.”
Murphy was one of 13 Senate Democrats to sign a letter to the Biden administration calling for “a short-term cessation of hostilities” in the Gaza Strip, with the aim to allow aid to reach the territory’s besieged civilians and to release the hostages taken by Hamas. Intense diplomatic efforts, led by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, have so far failed to persuade Israel to allow “humanitarian pauses” in its unyielding bombardment of Gaza.
On Capitol Hill, support for a ceasefire resolution in the House now has 18 Democratic co-sponsors, up from 13 when it was first introduced. And last week, Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, became the first lawmaker in the upper chamber to endorse the idea of a ceasefire, if it is tied to the release of all the hostages taken by Hamas.
Growing angst among Democrats in Washington has highlighted a smoldering debate within the party over the the month-old conflict. Over the past several weeks, Democrats have watched their Muslim and Jewish colleagues level accusations of intolerance against one another as hundreds of their staffers press their bosses to support a ceasefire resolution and their voters begin to turn away from a president they helped elect.
Meanwhile, members of the “Squad” are facing Democratic primary challenges next year, fueled in part by their criticism of Israel.
On Tuesday, the House passed a censure resolution accusing Tlaib of “promoting false narratives” about the Hamas attack on Israel and “calling for the destruction of the state of Israel” late on Tuesday night after an emotional debate.
Her voice shaking, Tlaib defended her stance in a floor speech on Tuesday, declaring that she would “not be silenced and I will not let you distort my words”.
“I can’t believe I have to say this but Palestinian people are not disposable,” she said, holding up a photograph of her grandmother, who lives in the West Bank. “We are human beings just like anybody else.”
The censure came after Democrats united last week to help block an initial attempt to reproach Tlaib, whose views and rhetoric on the decades-old conflict have long attracted controversy. But in the days since, several colleagues said they felt her rhetoric went too far.
A video featuring Tlaib and shared by the congresswoman on social media includes a clip of pro-Palestinian protesters chanting “From the river to the sea,” a slogan widely condemned by Jewish leaders and her fellow Democrats as antisemitic. Tlaib said on X, formerly Twitter, that the phrase was “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate”.
Tlaib also said in the video aimed at pressuring Biden to support a ceasefire: “We will remember in 2024.” Text then appears accusing the president of abetting the “genocide of the Palestinian people”.

As debate began on the censure, a group of House Democrats co-signed a statement denouncing the phrase as a “rallying cry for the destruction of the State of Israel and genocide of the Jewish people”.
The censure amounted to a stunning rebuke of their Democratic colleague, a sign of the strong emotions stirred by the Israel-Gaza war.
But the divisions are not unique to the American left. In the UK, the conflict is forcing a similar reckoning within the Labour party, where the leader, Keir Starmer, is facing calls to stand down from within his own party over his refusal to advocate for a ceasefire.
Starmer’s position has spurred a growing rebellion among Labour councillors, several of whom have resigned in protest over Starmer’s position. Though Labour appears on track to easily defeat the ruling Tory party in the next general election, polls show the party’s voters are deeply dissatisfied with Starmer’s handling of the conflict.
In the US, Bernie Sanders, the senior Vermont senator who is both Jewish and progressive, denounced the use of incendiary rhetoric by members of both parties, arguing that the comments were unhelpful.
Sanders has drawn sharp criticism from some of his most ardent supporters angry that the senator has resisted calls for a ceasefire, which he said he doesn’t believe would be possible with an organization like Hamas.
In a CNN interview on Sunday, Sanders was strident in calling for an immediate stop to Israeli bombing and an end to the killing of thousands of “innocent men, women and children” in the enclave. He said the US should consider using its military aid to Israel as leverage to pressure Tel Aviv to change course.
As Congress rushes to approve emergency aid to Israel, Sanders said: “It’s terribly important that, as we debate that, to say to Israel, ‘You want this money, you got to change your military strategy.’”
In dealing with such a “horrendously complex issue”, Sanders said he agreed with Barack Obama, who recently offered his analysis of the conflict. “If you want to solve the problem, then you have to take in the whole truth,” Obama said in an interview with his former staffers for their podcast, Pod Save America.
“And you then have to admit nobody’s hands are clean, that all of us are complicit to some degree.”

Pregnant in Gaza with no clinics: ‘I have no idea where I will give birth’,2023-11-08,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/08/pregnant-in-gaza-and-no-clinics-i-have-no-idea-where-i-will-give-birth,"As one of 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza, Noor Hammad faces a traumatic birth and fraught start in life for her first baby
On 6 October, Noor Hammad went to work as usual at a clinic in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, where she was employed as a nutritionist. In the evening she made dinner for herself and her husband. They were planning for the birth of their first child in January and had been decorating a bedroom in readiness for her arrival.
The bedroom no longer exists. Their house was destroyed in airstrikes just days after the couple fled to the south of Gaza on 9 October.
Hammad is now living in her sister’s two-bedroom home in Khan Younis, where she sleeps on the floor with 25 other members of her family.
Excited anticipation over the arrival of her baby has been replaced with anxiety about her safety, the health of the unborn child and how she will give birth in a war zone.
“I have no idea where I will give birth to my daughter and how I will receive her without shelter or clothes,” she says. “I don’t have anything.”
Hammad, 24, is one of an estimated 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza facing an uncertain birth.
The UN Children’s Fund (Unicef); the UN Population Fund (UNFPA); the World Health Organization and other agencies said at the weekend that with 14 of the 35 hospitals and 46 of 72 health centres destroyed or no longer functioning, 180 women a day were giving birth without adequate care, including undergoing caesareans without painkillers, and being discharged, still bleeding, within hours of the delivery.
In a joint statement, they warned: “Some women are having to give birth in shelters, in their homes, in the streets amid rubble, or in overwhelmed healthcare facilities, where sanitation is worsening, and the risk of infection and medical complications is on the rise.”
Those medical facilities that remain open are overwhelmed with people wounded in airstrikes. “Maternal deaths are expected to increase, given the lack of access to adequate care,” the agencies said.
“The psychological toll of the hostilities also has direct – and sometimes deadly – consequences on reproductive health, including a rise in stress-induced miscarriages, still births and premature births,” they said.
Dr Zaher Sahloul, president of the aid group MedGlobal, says: “As hospitals turn off the last of their equipment due to lack of fuel, neonatal wards are falling dark, and newborns and mothers are suffering. These are among the saddest, yet easily preventable, tragedies.”
Hammad has witnessed the daily chaos facing healthcare workers while volunteering at Gaza’s Nasser hospital. “Injuries are being treated in the hospital courtyards and corridors,” she says.
“Complete surgical operations are performed without sterilisation or anaesthesia. The scenes are very difficult but this is the least I can offer my countrymen.”
The hospital is so overwhelmed that she has been unable to see a doctor to check on the health of her baby, and believes there is little likelihood of giving birth there or at any other health facility.
“I am not ready at all to give birth because hospitals at the present time do not receive cases similar to mine due to the number of injuries [they are dealing with].”
In the meantime, Hammad walks to a centre of the UN’s aid agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) two or three times a week to collect tinned food and drinking water. The food is nowhere near enough for the 25 members of her family and she worries that the poor nutrition and polluted or salty water will harm her unborn child.
“I eat some foodstuffs with preservatives added to them that harm my health and the health of my foetus,” she says. “My health and psychological condition are not good.
“I cannot describe the extent of my suffering; all of our dreams have been destroyed. I hope this war will end and I can give birth to my daughter in peace.”

In a separate statement, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said a humanitarian convoy of five trucks and two ICRC vehicles came under fire in Gaza City on Tuesday.
The humanitarian convoy was carrying “lifesaving medical supplies to health facilities including to Al Quds hospital of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, when it was hit by fire”, it said.
The ICRC did not specify who had fired at its convoy or from what direction the fire came.

Here are some of the latest images from Gaza. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) are encircling Gaza City and operating inside it.
The remains of seven Thai nationals killed in Israel are expected to arrive in Bangkok on Thursday afternoon, Thailand’s foreign ministry has said.About 30,000 Thais were working in Israel before the Hamas attacks, and the Israeli government has said they make up the biggest group of foreign people killed or missing.
In total, 34 Thai people were killed in the violence, while four are being treated in hospital. A further 24 were abducted.Thai officials have met with Hamas, as well as Qatar and Egypt in order to secure the hostages’ release. They have also received support from neighbouring Malaysia, a vocal supporter of Palestine.
About 8,000 Thais have now been repatriated.
In case you missed this earlier: an employee of medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has been killed in Gaza along with several family members, the group said Tuesday.
Mohammed Al Ahel, a laboratory technician, was killed in his home in the Shati refugee camp when the area was bombed and his building collapsed, MSF said in a statement.
“Today, Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is mourning the loss of one of our team members in Gaza, Mohammed Al Ahel, who was killed along with several members of his family on November 6,” the medical charity said.
“It is clear that no place in Gaza is safe from brutal and indiscriminate bombing,” it said.
“Our repeated calls for an immediate ceasefire have gone unanswered, but we insist that it is the only way to prevent more senseless deaths across Gaza and allow adequate humanitarian aid into the Strip,” the charity said.
More now on the Israeli strikes inside Lebanon in the last 24 hours.
Journalists for Lebanon’s National News Agency report that Israeli airstrikes have hit the outskirts of the Lebanese villages of Yater, Kafra and Shebaa, with artillery shelling landing near Ramyah and Ayta ash Shab. The reports were published by the agency between six and seven hours ago.
The agency reports that a strike hit a residential building in Yater and that residents were not injured.
Reuters: G7 foreign ministers discussed how to revitalise peace efforts in the Middle East and the “day after” in the Gaza Strip once the conflict there recedes as they met for a two-day summit in Tokyo.The subject was brought up during a working dinner late on Tuesday, host Japan said in a statement, with the Group of Seven (G7) due to continue talks on Wednesday on the Israel-Gaza crisis, Russia’s war in Ukraine and issues related to China.The statement gave no details of options being discussed if the Hamas militant group is ousted from Gaza as the result of an ongoing Israeli bombardment of Gaza.Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told the Wall Street Journal that Israel wants the territory to be under an international coalition, including the US, European Union and Muslim-majority countries, or administered by local Gaza political leaders.Diplomats in Washington, the United Nations, the Middle East and beyond have also started weighing the options.Discussions include the deployment of a multinational force to post-conflict Gaza, an interim Palestinian-led administration that would exclude Hamas politicians, a stopgap security and governance role for neighbouring Arab states and temporary UN supervision of the territory, Reuters reported this month.
The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled) has released an infographic showing the wave of protests worldwide trigged by the Israel-Hamas war.
Acled says protests related to the conflict account for 38% of all demonstrations globally. The organisation looked at demonstrations between 7-27 October 2023.
The graphic below shows nearly 1400 demonstrations in the Middle East and north Africa, where the organisation says protest activity is concentrated. It found that most events were reported in Yemen, Turkey, Iran and Morocco, in that order.
The United States had the highest number of counter-demonstrations involving opposing pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protests, which Acled said reflected the significant divisions in public opinion.
More than a dozen demonstrations in Germany turned violent, Acled said.
The latest escalation in the Israel-Palestine conflict has triggered a wave of protests around the world. So far, ACLED has recorded 4,200 demonstrations related to the conflict, accounting for 38% of all demonstrations globally.New infographic ▶️ https://t.co/JTf1Is67Bn pic.twitter.com/JTB0S2p2yM
Israel has struck Lebanese territory multiple times in the last 24 hours, according to statements from the IDF, in what the IDF said were responses to firing on Israel and “a suspicious aerial target” detected in Israeli territory.
Late on Tuesday evening in Israel, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that Israeli forces had struck what it said were Hezbollah targets in Lebanon “in response to firing from Lebanese territory earlier today”.
Israeli warplanes struck inside Lebanon multiple times, according to Hagari, on what it said were Hezbollah targets, including a “warehouse, launch positions, infrastructure for targeting terrorism and sites where technological means” are located.
מטוסי קרב של צה""ל תקפו מטרות של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה ביניהן מחסן אמל""ח, עמדות שיגור, תשתיות להכוונת טרור ואתרים בהם ממוקמים אמצעים טכנולוגיים של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה. התקיפה בוצעה בתגובה לירי משטח לבנון מוקדם יותר היום >> pic.twitter.com/R2RA5u0AVr
Earlier on Tuesday, the IDF said that “about 20 launches were detected that crossed the territory of Lebanon into Israel”.
Roughly 16 hours ago, the IDF said it fired into Lebanon in response to what it says was “a suspicious aerial target” intercepted near the blue line which marks the UN-drawn boundary between Israel and Lebanon.
Israeli forces and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire along the border between Israel and Lebanon since 8 October, the Associated Press reports, as the Israel-Hamas war threatens to turn into a wider conflict.
On Monday, Lebanese state media said that three children and their grandmother were killed in an Israeli air strike, an incident that prompted retaliatory rocket strikes on the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona.
For Hezbollah, fully entering the Israel-Hamas war would risk dragging Lebanon, which is facing a devastated economy and internal political tensions, into a conflict it cannot afford, fuelling domestic opposition to the group.
But, the AP writes, “staying on the sidelines as Israeli troops take control of the Gaza Strip could compromise Hezbollah’s credibility, and a Hamas defeat would be a blow to Iran. Hezbollah’s steady pressure on Israel’s northern border shows support for Hamas and keeps open the threat of a wider intervention”.
AFP: Since 17 October US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria have been targeted by drone or rocket attacks at least 40 times, injuring dozens of US personnel, according to the Pentagon.
Tuesday’s attack was claimed by a group known as “Islamic Resistance in Iraq” on Telegram channels affiliated with Iraqi factions close to Tehran. The same group has claimed most of the recent attacks.
Some 2,500 American troops are deployed in Iraq and another 900 in Syria, as part of the international anti-jihadist coalition that was established in 2014.
In Iraq, the coalition says its role is limited to advising and supporting local counterparts.
AFP: A drone attack on Tuesday targeted a military base at Arbil airport in Iraqi Kurdistan that hosts troops from the US-led anti-jihadist coalition, officials said.
“At two different points, three drones attacked the international coalition” on Tuesday morning, the autonomous Kurdish region’s anti-terrorism service said in a statement.
In the first attack “on the military base at Arbil airport, two drones were shot down”, while a third subsequently crashed without exploding, the service said.
The Pentagon later confirmed that an attack had taken place in Iraqi Kurdistan without causing casualties or damage, but only mentioned one drone that failed to detonate on impact.
American and allied forces were also targeted in Syria on Tuesday, where rockets were fired at Mission Support Site Euphrates without causing casualties or damage, the Pentagon said.
Following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October, a series of rocket and drone attacks have targeted military bases hosting US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria.
Here is our full story on Labour frontbencher Imran Hussain’s resignation to support a ceasefire in Gaza.
The shadow minister Imran Hussain has resigned from Keir Starmer’s Labour frontbench in order to “be able to strongly advocate for a ceasefire” in Gaza.
“Over recent weeks, it has become clear that my view on the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza differs substantially from the position you have adopted,” Hussain said in a resignation letter to Starmer published on social media.
“A ceasefire is essential to ending the bloodshed, to ensuring that enough aid can pass into Gaza and reach those most in need, and to help ensure the safe return of the Israeli hostages.”
He said he had been “proud” to work alongside Sir Keir and his deputy Angela Rayner in developing a plan for employment rights, but could not “in all good conscience” push for a cessation of hostilities while remaining part of the frontbench.
The Bradford East MP, who was a shadow minister for work, said he had been “deeply troubled” by Starmer’s comments during an LBC interview on 11 October where said his party leader appeared to endorse Israel cutting off water and power to the Gaza Strip; and while Starmer had since clarified his remarks, “I believe the party needs to go further and call for a ceasefire”.
Reuters: Israel’s ground forces in the Gaza Strip are aiming to locate and disable Hamas militants’ vast tunnel network, the next phase in an Israeli offensive that has killed thousands of Palestinians.Israel has used ground troops to divide Gaza in two.Gaza City, the territory’s largest town and Hamas’ main stronghold, is encircled. Israel says its troops have advanced to the heart of the city while Hamas says its fighters have inflicted heavy losses on the invading forces.
Chief Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that Israel’s combat engineering corps were using explosive devices to destroy a tunnel network built by Hamas that stretches for hundreds of kilometres (miles) beneath Gaza.Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel had “one target – Hamas terrorists in Gaza, their infrastructure, their commanders, bunkers, communications rooms”.Israeli tanks have faced heavy resistance from Hamas fighters using the tunnel network to launch ambushes, two sources with Hamas and the separate militant group Islamic Jihad said.It was not possible to verify the battlefield claims of either side.

Israeli diplomat pressured US college to drop course on ‘apartheid’ debate,2023-11-08,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/08/israeli-diplomat-bard-college-apartheid-debate,"Consul Yuval Donio-Gideon objected to course at Bard College but president says institution ‘stood up for academic freedom’
An Israeli diplomat tried to persuade a leading New York college to cancel a course about the growing debate over whether the Jewish state practices a form of apartheid in Palestine.
The Israeli consul for public diplomacy in New York, Yuval Donio-Gideon, took the highly unusual step of contacting Bard College earlier this year to object to the course, Apartheid in Israel-Palestine, on the grounds that it breached the controversial International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism.
When the college defended the course, it came under pressure from pro-Israel groups and from at least one major donor. Robert Epstein, the property developer and co-owner of the Boston Celtics, resigned from Bard’s board of trustees in protest at Bard’s refusal to cancel the subject.
The course was designed and taught by Nathan Thrall, a Jewish American writer and researcher who lives in Jerusalem.
“The Israeli consulate contacted Bard and said they would like the course to be cancelled. There was mention of the IHRA definition of antisemitism which is the standard means of attempting to silence criticism of Israel,” said Thrall.
“When the consul spoke to Bard they explicitly said that we fear that if we do not make an example out of this class then classes like this are going to sprout like mushrooms all over the US.”
The president of Bard, Leon Botstein, confirmed that Donio-Gideon “called to inquire about the course and to object to it”.
“The consul hoped he could talk us into cancelling it. He argued that the course was somehow inappropriate but there was a very polite conversation and it ended there,” he said. “We stood up for academic freedom. The course was excellent, high level and not at all ideological preaching.”
Botstein said he did not find anything untoward in the Israeli consulate’s intervention. Asked if other foreign diplomats had ever called to object to the content of Bard’s curriculum, he said: “I’m sure they have, but I can’t recall.”
Bard, which runs a joint-degree program with a Palestinian university, Al-Quds in the West Bank, awarded Thrall a writing fellowship which he used to complete his recently published book, A Day in the Life of Abed Salama: Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy. The college also invited him to teach a course and Thrall proposed one on Israel and apartheid for the spring semester.
The basis of the course was the growing evidence that Israel is in breach of international laws against apartheid, including reports by Israel’s leading human rights group, B’Tselem, and from a prominent legal organisation, Yesh Din, which concluded that “the crime against humanity of apartheid is being committed in the West Bank”.
In September, a former head of the Mossad intelligence agency, Tamir Pardo, joined a rising number of prominent Israelis in comparing the occupation of the West Bank to South Africa’s defunct system of racial oppression.
Thrall said there was no opposition to the course until shortly before it began when a tweet by a human rights group drew attention to it.
At that point, Donio-Gideon approached the college, initially through its rabbi. Thrall said the Israeli diplomat “said the course meets the IHRA definition” of antisemitism. Among IHRA’s examples of antisemitism is “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour”.
The consulate’s intervention came at a time when the Israeli government was threatening to “publish a ranking of the most antisemitic campuses in the US; to shame institutions that promote anti-Israel positions, where Jewish students feel unsafe”.
The Israeli consulate in New York said in a statement that it had a “moral imperative to alert academic institutions about content that defames Israel and could incite antisemitism and jeopardize the safety of Jewish students on campus”.
“We hold academic freedom in high esteem and respect decisions made by universities. However, the recent surge of antisemitic incidents on campuses demonstrates that our concern is both grounded and urgent,” the consulate said. “We will continue to share our concerns for a fair and accurate representation of Israel, and vigilantly oppose any form of hate speech that puts any student community at risk.”
Botstein, a renowned conductor who is music director of the American Symphony Orchestra, said that there was pressure from other quarters. Epstein, the former Bard board member, “had very strong objections”.
“After a conversation with him, he chose to resign from the board. He made a very strong statement about the course in resigning. I failed to convince him that this was the wrong thing to do. I invited him to visit the course but this is an issue where people’s emotions run high and those emotions often blind them from looking at the issue more dispassionately, or hearing another point of view,” said Botstein.
The Bard president said he did not know whether Epstein would now honour a $2.5m pledge to the college.
Epstein, who did not respond to a request for comment, is a national commissioner of the strongly pro-Israel pressure group, the Anti-Defamation League. His wife, Esther, is a past chair of the ADL’s board.
The ADL’s chief executive, Jonathan Greenblatt, also sought to pressure Bard. Botstein described their conversation as tense.
“He was not open to a free discussion. He was not civil. And he did not accept our invitation to visit the course and see for himself. He called already intent on trying to pressure us to cancel the course,” he said.
The ADL said in a statement to the Guardian that Greenblatt spoke to Botstein “to convey serious concerns over the course”.
“The entire premise of this course slanders and delegitimizes the democratic state of Israel,” it said. “At a time of surging rates of antisemitic incidents in the United States, some of the most inciteful taking place on college campuses, ADL is unapologetic in our advocacy for Israel and the Jewish people. We will continue to work tirelessly against efforts that delegitimize Israel and vilify Jews and we stand by our belief that courses like this should not exist because of the fallacies they are based upon.”
The course was also denounced by local Jewish groups. The Ulster County Jewish Federation wrote to Botstein calling it a “detestable example of antisemitism masquerading as academic freedom”.
The UCJF’s executive director, David Drimer, told a local newspaper, the Daily Freeman, that Bard was influenced in its decision to hold the course by a $500m endowment to the college from George Soros who has been at the centre of antisemitic conspiracy theories on the right.
Drimer wrote to Botstein attempting to link Thrall to Hamas.
“This class is wrong in its inception, and we are ethically compelled to point out why: Nathan Thrall is heavily financed by the government by Qatar, a leading funder of Hamas and other officially designated terrorist groups,” he said.
Thrall previously worked for the International Crisis Group which received a donation from Qatar after he left.
“Must we accept as coincidence Mr Soros finances Mr Thrall and Bard?” Drimer added. “I am compelled to connect the dots.”
Botstein responded to the UCJF letter saying that “as a child of survivors of the Holocaust I am more sensitive than most” to antisemitism.
“There is nothing antisemitic about the course in question. It explores questions that have been the subject of debate in Israel for years. Why should the Jewish community in America be afraid of the same debates and arguments taking place in Israel?” he said.

Sunak accused of ‘silly posturing’ by ex-Tory minister after climbdown over pro-Palestine rally,2023-11-08,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/08/rishi-sunak-says-armistice-day-pro-palestine-rally-to-go-ahead-after-police-talks,"Despite concession from PM, Suella Braverman criticises police for being harder on rightwing groups than ‘pro-Palestinian mobs’
Rishi Sunak has been accused of “silly puffed-up posturing” by senior Tories after being forced to concede at the 11th hour that a pro-Palestine march planned for Armistice Day will go ahead.
For days ministers have insisted that the march through central London should not proceed out of respect for commemorations being held on 11 November.
In a thinly veiled attack on the Met police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, over his decision not to ban the march, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, accused the police of taking a tougher approach to rightwing groups than to “pro-Palestinian mobs displaying almost identical behaviour” in an article on Wednesday.
“It may be that senior officers are more concerned with how much flak they are likely to get than whether this perceived unfairness alienates the majority,” Braverman wrote in the Times. “The government has a duty to take a broader view.”
The prime minister had described the planned protests as “disrespectful” earlier on Wednesday, but had been forced to concede after a meeting with Rowley that those who wished to take to the streets had a “right to peacefully protest”.
In a statement issued after a hastily arranged meeting with the police chief on Wednesday afternoon, Sunak sought to portray his acceptance of the Met chief’s decision as a principled one.
He said: “This weekend people around the UK will come together in quiet reflection to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. It is not hyperbole to say that we are the beneficiaries of an inheritance born of their sacrifice.
“It is because that sacrifice is so immense that Saturday’s planned protest is not just disrespectful but offends our heartfelt gratitude to the memory of those who gave so much so that we may live in freedom and peace today.
“But part of that freedom is the right to peacefully protest. And the test of that freedom is whether our commitment to it can survive the discomfort and frustration of those who seek to use it, even if we disagree with them. We will meet that test and remain true to our principles.”
The former Conservative minister Nicholas Soames said the prime minister should never have interfered, and accused Sunak of “playing politics” with hard-won freedoms.
Lord Soames, who is Winston Churchill’s grandson, said: “Whether this march went ahead was always an operational matter, and was not a decision for either the prime minister or the home secretary. This was a decision for the Met commissioner, who knows how to do his job.
“I hope we can move on and I hope that everyone behaves properly on the day, which is a solemn and important occasion for many people,” he said.
A second former minister told the Guardian: “Puffed up posturing followed by a climbdown makes Rishi Sunak look silly. And the only reason he was endorsed as PM was because MPs thought he would stop making the party a laughing stock following two chaotic PMs. I despair.”
Another senior Tory said the government’s climbdown was a “complete mess”. “It demonstrates what happens when the government attempts to tell the police what do based on political posturing and ignorance. They need to stop undermining the professionalism of our police.”
Rowley had been forced to cancel an appearance at another event after being summoned to Downing Street on Wednesday afternoon.
Sunak had told reporters that he would hold Rowley “accountable” for his decision but subsequently said he had been reassured that events over the weekend would not be disrupted.
The protest is scheduled to start at 12.45pm at Marble Arch and end at the US embassy in south-west London, about two miles from the Cenotaph, where formal remembrance events will be held the next day.
Sunak said: “This afternoon I asked the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, to come to Downing Street and provide reassurances that the police are taking every step necessary to safeguard remembrance services, provide reassurance to those who wish to pay their respects across the country and keep the public safe from disorder this weekend.
“It’s welcome that the police have confirmed that the march will be away from the Cenotaph and they will ensure that the timings do not conflict with any remembrance events. There remains the risk of those who seek to divide society using this weekend as a platform to do so.
“That is what I discussed with the Metropolitan police commissioner in our meeting. The commissioner has committed to keep the Met police’s posture under constant review based on the latest intelligence about the nature of the protests.”
Steve Hartshorn, the chair of the Police Federation, said politicians should keep out of operational matters.
“I would like the politics to be kept out of policing and allow us to do the job we are empowered to do, to uphold the laws we have, to the best of our ability,” Hartshorn said. “The commissioner and his team need to be allowed to do their job without political interference. It is ultimately police officers who become the focal point if tensions are inflamed.
“There is potential that government rhetoric could inflame tensions. Anyone is entitled to their view, but policing must be allowed to get on with its job, without political commentary.”
A former head of counter-terrorism, Neil Basu, said the government criticism of Rowley’s position had put the country’s top police officer in an “absolutely outrageous position”.
Basu, who is a friend of Rowley’s, told LBC Radio: “I think what you’re witnessing is the end of operational independence of policing. This is the start of it. I say that, that strongly.”
Labour’s leader, Keir Starmer, accused Sunak of “cowardice” for “picking a fight” with the police.
The organiser of the sole Armistice Day event at the Cenotaph in central London told the Guardian that he believed the pro-Palestine march should be allowed to go ahead.
Richard Hughes, from the Western Front Association, a charity that holds a commemoration on 11 November for the casualties of the first world war, said the organisation believed in “freedom of speech”.
“I think a lot of people are trying to whip this up,” said Hughes, the association’s legal trustee, who is also responsible for organising the annual commemoration. “The police are not going to let anyone near the Cenotaph. We are a democratic organisation that commemorates those who fought for democracy, so free speech is important.”
People attending pro-Palestine marches in recent weeks have been calling for a ceasefire in the war that broke out last month after Hamas killed 1,400 people, mainly civilians, in Israel and took about 240 hostages.
Over 10,000 of civilians in Gaza, many of them children, have been killed in the Israeli military operation since, according to Gaza’s health authority, which is run by Hamas.

"Israeli airstrikes on Gaza have killed dozens of Hamas commanders, says IDF",2023-11-08,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/08/israeli-airstrikes-on-gaza-have-killed-dozens-of-hamas-commanders-says-idf,"Troops have entered Gaza City and fighting is under way but analysts say there is no sign yet Hamas is significantly weaker
Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have killed dozens of Hamas commanders as troops advance deeper into the battered territory, with some fighting in “the heart of Gaza City”, Israel Defence Forces (IDF) officials and analysts have said.
However, there were doubts over the importance of the dead commanders within Hamas, and analysts said there was no obvious sign that the organisation had yet been significantly weakened.
Israeli leaders swore to crush Hamas after the extremist Islamist organisation launched terrorist attacks from Gaza into southern Israel, killing 1,400 people in their homes and at a dance party on 7 October. Most of those who died were civilians, and including many young children and older people.
Since then, an Israeli ground and air offensive has wrought massive destruction across Gaza, displacing at least 1.3 million people and killing 10,569 – including 4,324 children and 2,823 women – according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry in the territory.
Analysts said the mission of the Israeli armed forces is to kill all the senior leaders of Hamas, to destroy its capacity to pose any future threat.
“Right now the IDF is trying to translate the terms ‘erasing’ or ‘crushing’ Hamas into concrete results, so that means destroying all military infrastructure and killing leaders, not just the heads of brigade, field commanders and so on but also the members of the political bureau too,” said Dr Michael Milstein, a Hamas expert at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University.
Hamas spokesmen have denied Israeli forces had made major advances. “I challenge [Israel] if it has been able, to this moment, to record any military achievement on the ground other than killing civilians,” the senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told Al Jazeera television.
On Tuesday, an IDF spokesperson said that Israel had killed Mohsen Abu Zina, “one of Hamas’s leading weapons developers and an expert in developing strategic weapons and rockets used by Hamas terrorists”.
A day earlier, the IDF said it had killed a “battalion commander” responsible for sending elite units into Israel on 7 October. Three weeks ago Aimen Nowfil, a member of Hamas’s top military command committee and one of its most senior leaders, died in an airstrike. The death of Nowfil was confirmed by Hamas.
However, Israel’s primary targets – the political leader Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’s military wing in Gaza – are still alive.
Sinwar, 61, has been repeatedly described as a “dead man walking” by Israeli military officials.
In a televised address on Tuesday, the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said that Sinwar was hiding in a bunker, “out of touch with his surroundings”. Deif is also believed to be underground.
Milstein said that Hamas was still stable, and that casualties suffered so far were heavy but had yet to “undermine the structure” of the organisation.
“You cannot implement the goal of causing severe damage to Hamas without killing the top leaders. It is like the US in Iraq in 2003. Until you get Saddam you can’t consider the war an achievement,” he told the Guardian.
The IDF attack that caused significant civilian casualties in the Jabalia refugee camp also killed Ibrahim Biari, a senior Hamas commander and one of the architects of the 7 October attack, Israeli officials have claimed.
“Israelis went ahead with the bombing in Jabaliya camp because they knew there was a high value target there and so were not concerned by collateral damage,” said Bilal Saab, an expert at Chatham House in London.
Israeli officials accuse Hamas of using civilians to shield leaders and key infrastructure, releasing images on Wednesday that appear to show tunnel entrances close to an amusement park with a large ferris wheel.
The vast tunnel network built by Hamas under the densely populated territory poses a significant challenge to the Israeli effort.
“At some point they are going to have to go deep into the tunnels and find these people and that is where it gets messy,” said Saab.
Hamas leaders have said the 7 October attacks were aimed to “change the entire equation and not just have a clash”.
“We succeeded in putting the Palestinian issue back on the table, and now no one in the region is experiencing calm,” Khalil al-Hayya, a member of Hamas’s top leadership body, told the New York Times in Doha, Qatar.
“What could change the equation was a great act, and, without a doubt, it was known that the reaction to this great act would be big.”
Palestinian media reported clashes between militants and Israeli forces near al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City and Hamas’s armed wing said its fighters had destroyed an Israeli tank in Gaza City. There was no independent verification of this claim.
Israel said on Wednesday two further IDF soldiers had been killed in the offensive, bringing the total to at least 30.
The more than 240 hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October and thought to be held in the tunnels further complicates the Israeli military operation.
Israel said it will not agree to a ceasefire until the hostages are released. Hamas said it will not stop fighting while Gaza is under attack.
The fighting is concentrated in the north of the Gaza Strip and Israel has repeatedly told civilians to flee to the south, but it has been bombing southern areas as well.
In the main southern city Khan Younis, six Palestinians, including a young girl, were killed in a house that was hit, medics said.
The UN says Gaza’s health system is close to collapse, with remaining hospitals short of medicines and fuel.
“The longer we wait, the worse some patients will get. Many people will die merely because they have no access to treatment,” said Osama Qadoumi, the supervisor at Makassed hospital.
One reason Israel has denied access to fuel supplies into Gaza – despite the acute humanitarian need – is a belief that it will be used to power systems that supply air and light to the underground network of bunkers where Hamas leaders are sheltering, officials said. Hamas has denied such claims.

"Northern Gaza exodus accelerating, says Israel, as WHO warns of disease risk",2023-11-09,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/09/israel-hamas-war-tens-thousands-palestinians-flee-gaza-military-who-disease-risk,"IDF says 50,000 people moved south on Wednesday, up from 15,000 a day earlier, claiming Hamas has lost control of the north
Tens of thousands of Palestinians fled northern Gaza on Wednesday, the Israeli military has said, as the World Health Organization (WHO) warns of “worrying trends” in the risk of disease after weeks of Israeli airstrikes.
The increasing evacuation came as Israeli forces closed in on the centre of Gaza City, launching intense bombardments, and claimed Hamas had lost control of the north of the Gaza Strip.
Israeli troops secured a key Hamas stronghold, known as Outpost 17, in Jabaliya in northern Gaza after a 10-hour battle, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said on Thursday.
“The fighters completed the takeover of the outpost after 10 hours of fighting, during which they eliminated terrorists, seized many weapons, uncovered terrorist tunnel shafts, including a shaft located near a kindergarten and leading to an extensive underground route,” they said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
The IDF added that its troops had discovered a Hamas weapons manufacturing and storage site in a residential building in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood in northern Gaza. The IDF reports have not been independently verified.
The Israeli military also said that, for the fifth consecutive day, it had opened an evacuation corridor to allow civilians in northern Gaza to move south.
Those fleeing Israel’s expanding ground assault included children, older people and people with disabilities, most walking with minimal belongings, the UN said. Many carried makeshift white flags for fear they could be targeted. The Israeli military said 50,000 people had fled the north on Wednesday, up from 15,000 on Tuesday.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called on Thursday for a “ceasefire” in Gaza as he opened a conference on aid for the territory. “In the immediate term, we need to work on protecting civilians. To do that, we need a humanitarian pause very quickly and we must work towards a ceasefire,” he told delegates in Paris.
The UN commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, also called for a ceasefire and said both sides had committed war crimes during the conflict.
“The atrocities perpetrated by Palestinian armed groups on 7 October were heinous, they were war crimes – as is the continued holding of hostages,” he said at the Rafah crossing in Egypt on Wednesday. “The collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians is also a war crime, as is unlawful forcible evacuation of civilians.”
The WHO warned of an increased risk of contagious disease in Gaza because Israeli air bombardments had disrupted the health system, access to clean water and forced people to crowd in shelters.
“As deaths and injuries in Gaza continue to rise due to intensified hostilities, intense overcrowding and disrupted health, water, and sanitation systems pose an added danger: the rapid spread of infectious diseases,” WHO said on Wednesday. “Some worrying trends are already emerging.”
The WHO said the lack of fuel in the densely populated area had caused desalination plants to shut down, increasing the risk of bacterial infections such as diarrhoea.
While there have been extremely limited deliveries of food, water and medicine to Gaza, Israel has refused to let in fuel, citing concerns it could be diverted by Hamas, despite calls from the UN and humanitarian aid groups.
Eighteen of Gaza’s 35 hospitals have closed, local health officials say, putting the remaining facilities under enormous pressure. There are reports of operations, including amputations, being carried out by torchlight, without anaesthetic and with vinegar used as a disinfectant.
The WHO said more than 33,551 cases of diarrhoea had been reported since mid-October, mostly among children under five.
The lack of fuel has also disrupted the collection of solid waste, which WHO said created an “environment conducive to the rapid and widespread proliferation of insects and rodents that can carry and transmit diseases”.
Palestinians living in the heart of Gaza City said they could see and hear Israeli ground forces closing in from different directions on Wednesday, increasing the departure of thousands of civilians as urban fighting between Israel and Hamas heated up.
The Israeli army has not provided details of troop movements as it presses its ground attack, vowing to crush Hamas after its deadly 7 October assault inside Israel. But Gaza City residents said the IDF had moved into inner neighbourhoods amid intense bombardment throughout the north.
Clashes took place within about half a mile of the territory’s largest hospital, al-Shifa, a focal point in the war. The Israeli military says Hamas’s main command centre is in and under the hospital complex, and that senior leaders of the group are hiding there, using it as a shield.
Hamas and hospital staff deny this, saying the IDF is using the allegation as a pretext to strike the hospital.
Israel’s military spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing on Wednesday that Hamas had lost control of the north. “We saw 50,000 Gazans move from the northern Gaza Strip to the south [on Wednesday]. They are moving because they understand that Hamas has lost control in the north,” he said. “Hamas has lost control and is continuing to lose control in the north.”
Hagari added that there would be no ceasefire but that Israel had been allowing humanitarian pauses at specific times to let residents move south.
While about 70% of Gaza’s population in the north is believed to have fled, UN officials estimate that roughly 300,000 people have stayed behind.

Israel-Hamas war: what we know on day 34,2023-11-09,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/09/israel-hamas-war-what-we-know-on-day-34,"Eighteen Palestinians killed and at least 20 injured in IDF raid on Jenin city; Israeli military says tactical pauses in fighting do not constitute ceasefire
 At least 10,812 Palestinians, including 4,412 children, have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the health ministry in Gaza has said in its latest update on Thursday.
 Eighteen Palestinians have been killed and at least 20 others injured by the Israel Defence Forces during a raid on Thursday on Jenin city and its refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. According to Palestinian health ministry figures, at least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the 7 October attack on Israel.
 Officials and diplomats are negotiating a days-long ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages, including children, women, elderly and sick people, the Guardian understands. The discussions include the possibility of a one- to three-day ceasefire, although nothing has been agreed, sources with knowledge of the negotiations have said.
 The White House announced that Israel would begin to implement four-hour “humanitarian pauses” in parts of northern Gaza to allow people to leave. The US national security spokesperson, John Kirby, described it as “a significant first step”. The US state department later said on Thursday that there will be two humanitarian corridors for civilians to leave hostile areas of northern Gaza.
 The Israeli military has said it has not agreed to a ceasefire but that it will continue to allow “tactical, local pauses” to let in humanitarian aid into Gaza. “There’s no ceasefire, I repeat there’s no ceasefire. What we are doing, that four-hour window, these are tactical, local pauses for humanitarian aid,” an army spokesperson said.
 Thousands of Palestinians continued to flee south from northern Gaza. Israel said it had allowed movement along the Salah al-Din road – the main highway that runs along the Gaza Strip – for the fifth consecutive day. Images of the mass exodus showed many people evacuating on foot with their belongings tied to their backs, with some pushing wheelchairs and prams.
 The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt reopened on Thursday for limited evacuations. Several dozen foreign passport holders and dependents, along with 12 medical evacuees, were reportedly able to cross the border on Thursday after the crossing was suspended for a day.
 The International Red Cross temporarily paused its patient escorts after its convoy of trucks came under fire in Gaza. William Schomburg, the head of the organization’s Gaza office, called the incident “deeply alarming” and “unacceptable”. The organisation has since resumed bringing patients to the Egypt border crossing.
 The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has rejected Israeli plans to push civilians into safe zones in the south of Gaza and said the world must pursue a humanitarian ceasefire as the only way to save lives in the territory. Macron described the proposal for safe zones in the south of Gaza as a very bad idea that would not guarantee safety because no political agreement existed for them.
 Belgium’s deputy prime minister, Petra De Sutter, has called on the Belgian government to adopt sanctions against Israel and investigate the bombings of hospitals and refugee camps in Gaza. “It is clear that Israel does not care about the international demands for a ceasefire,” she said, calling on the EU to immediately suspend its association agreement with Israel.
Netanyahu rejected a deal for a five-day ceasefire with Palestinian militant groups in Gaza in return for the release of some of the hostages held in the territory early in the war, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.
 More than half of the British nationals seeking to escape Gaza for Egypt have managed to do so, but there are still distressing cases of families being split up, the Foreign Office has confirmed.
 The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has said it is seeking nearly half a billion dollars to address the most critical humanitarian needs of people in the Gaza Strip and occupied West Bank.

‘In the last four weeks language has deserted me’: Adania Shibli on being shut down,2023-11-09,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/09/palestinian-author-adania-shibli-frankfurt-book-fair,"Speaking out for the first time since the postponement of her award ceremony at the Frankfurt book fair, the Palestinian author sheds light on her work and the power of linguistics and erasure
When she was a child, Adania Shibli encountered her first storyteller on her family’s almond and olive farm in Palestine. It was her mother. “When we didn’t have electricity, my mom would gather us around, because we were afraid and we couldn’t read. She would tell us stories until the light came back.”
Shibli’s mother didn’t read or write, so the stories she told live now only in Shibli’s brothers and sisters. On a recent morning, back in Zurich where the novelist is in residency, one of these tales chimneys up through memory. Retelling it over Zoom, Shibli’s face breaks into the wide smile that spreads across her face any time she speaks of her family. In the swirl of her telling, the plot floats away but one thing becomes clear: in the tale, as a result of a man’s carelessness to words, he loses everything.
Shibli is telling this story with a purpose. In mid-October, she was due to be awarded the LiBeraturpreis, an award for authors from the global south given out by the German literary organisation LitProm, at a ceremony at the Frankfurt book fair. She was abruptly disinvited “in a brief email”, as she puts it, with LitProm citing the war between Israel and Palestine. A letter criticising the postponement of her award was signed by more than 1,500 authors including Nobel prize winners Annie Ernaux, Abdulrazak Gurnah and Olga Tokarczuk. But Shibli herself has until now not commented on the affair in public.
In spite of the requests that piled on her desk by the dozens, she flew to Korea for a literary festival and a translation of her book. She had previously told people in Seoul she would come and she wasn’t going to go back on her word. “The minute you say you will do something, you have to do it.”
This attitude toward language is also one of the reasons why in 25 years of writing, Shibli has published only three short novels: Touch, We Are all Equally Far from Love and Minor Detail, exquisite, wind-tunnelled books which evoke the inner lives of characters against whom language has been used as a weapon, an instrument, a kind of cage. Her novels sculpt supple, exquisitely beautiful states of being which persist in her characters in spite of these systems, within the landscape of what she calls a “scarred language.”
This is especially true of Minor Detail, translated into English by Elisabeth Jaquette, a book of two entwined tales. In the first, unfolding in August 1949, an officer leading a battalion cleansing the southern Negev of remaining Arabs and Bedouins comes across, abducts, and ultimately rapes and kills a Bedouin girl. In the book’s second half, a woman born 25 years to the day after this crime reads a news item about it. She sets off to learn more, navigating all the obstacles one might expect a Palestinian faces trying to get through checkpoints to libraries and archives to access her past.
“It’s a miracle that the fiction Adania makes out of such cascadingly political material is so tightly existential,” says the novelist Adam Thirlwell in an email. “It’s something to do with the combination of intent, physical precision, of bodies and of landscapes, combined with her wild compositional control and darkly comic perspective. The novel is an intricate study of empathy and cross-border investigations.”
The book took Shibli 12 long years to write, during which she moved to London to complete a PhD in media and cultural studies (her thesis was on visual terror in 9/11). It was the time of the second intifada and she was having nightmares. Living far from where her language was spoken allowed Shibli to experience it more closely, though, including what became the first line of the book’s second part. “After I had finished hanging the curtains over the windows, I lay down on the bed.”
When it was published in Germany in the spring of 2022, Minor Detail was met with ecstatic reviews. But in the run-up to the Frankfurt book fair, the journalist Carsten Otte wrote a review complaining that in the book “all Israelis are anonymous rapists and killers, while the Palestinians are victims of poisoned or trigger-happy occupiers.” Shibli believes the review was instrumental in the decision to postpone her award. Still, she says, “I experienced this whole matter as a distraction from the real pain, not more”.
Speaking to me now, Shibli points out that all of the Palestinian characters in the book are nameless, too. In fact, the first time we encounter Arabs at all in the novel, it is only their shadows the soldier sees: “Their slender black shadows sometimes wavered in front of him, trembling between the hills, but whenever the vehicles raced toward them, they found no one when they arrived.”
Shibli’s heritage is also Bedouin. Her ancestors came to Palestine 1,000 years ago as warriors for Saladin, the first sultan of both Egypt and Syria. An enormous area of land was handed over to be controlled by her family, but with time it was reduced, first with the British rule over Mandatory Palestine, and then with the creation of Israel, which stopped their nomadic movements which “disrupts the control of land and people,” as Shibli puts it. In the end, the Israeli government confiscated all the lands, allowing her father to claim some back if he took it from another Palestinian family. He refused.
Shibli grew up on the farm that remained, going to work at the age of four. Before entering school she had learned reading and writing Arabic from one sister and English from another, and snuck books out on to the fields. “I spent more time with goats than my parents”, she laughs. At nine a sister gave her a notebook to write in and she didn’t look back. By university, she was writing texts, submitting them to the best magazines in Palestine. In her early 20s, a piece she wrote drew the attention of legendary poet Mahmoud Darwish, who summoned her to his office and asked her to write a four-page text. She did, and then he encouraged her for more: thus her novel Touch came to be.
Nearly 30 years later, Shibli summarises the flex of linguistic power and erasure her book was engaging with as follows: “In Palestine-Israel, I, like many others, grew up realising language is not merely a tool for communication. It often hides rather than articulates, holding between its silence endless possibilities not concerned with expression. Language can be attacked, abused. It can still offer the ultimate freedom of being and love you don’t have access to in reality.”

It is here, when it comes to being Palestinian, that the scar within language can be most painful. How to write what you cannot hear? It begins with deletion of “certain words,” Shibli says, “the most immediate one is ‘Palestine’, the names of places we articulate in Arabic but are never present in road signs or maps, the silence of everyone around us as to the past, the word Arab and Arabic being treated as curse words, ‘Arabic job’ used to mean a bad job, and so on.”
When she talks about language, Shibli often sounds as if she is speaking of a sentient being with a will all of its own. One that can be harmed. Since the explosion of violence in Israel and Palestine, words have left her almost entirely and she worries over their departure. “I was always afraid that one day I would wake up and I wouldn’t have language, this is my fear. And in the last four weeks language has deserted me, it was like it was not there. Whenever I tried, I failed.”
“I now understand this loss of language as an outcome of staying with pain: the incomprehensible pain of those in Palestine-Israel against whom a new degree of cruelty has been unleashed, the personal pain of the loss of a dream that we could dare to imagine a new form of togetherness, where we allow ourselves to learn from pain rather than unleash it against others.”
The numerous media requests of the last few weeks and the criticism of her not answering them, she says, has made her realise that we tend to reduce silence to something that must be rejected, rather than “recognising our disfluency as a companion to pain”. “Literature, for me, is the only place that accepts silence”.
She had, however, begun writing one text she planned to give as an acceptance speech before she was disinvited from the book fair. It was on book banning.
 This article was amended on 16 November 2023. In an earlier version, a subheading described Adania Shibli’s LiBeraturpreis award ceremony as having been “cancelled”. Frankfurt book fair has asked us to clarify that the ceremony has been indefinitely postponed, not cancelled. Text was also added to state that Minor Detail was translated into English by Elisabeth Jaquette.

"China has a history of being pro-Palestinian, but now faces diplomatic conundrum",2023-11-09,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/09/china-israel-pro-palestinian-history,"Rivalry with US and current of antisemitism are running up against Beijing’s increasing closeness to Israel
China was an early proponent of a ceasefire in Gaza and has called for wider talks on resolving the Palestinian question. But analysts say the situation is complicated, and it’s not clear what Beijing expects to achieve, and how it can get there.
Beijing has been a supporter of the Palestinians since the Mao era and long called for a two-state solution, but it is increasingly close to Israel, and is presenting itself as a neutral party that holds steadfast to a noninterference principle.
Beijing is also trying to build on its minimal but growing influence in the Middle East, where it has major economic interests, and also presenting itself as a leader of the global south, and furthering its anti-US agenda.
A week on from the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel, in which 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, called for a global peace conference and accused Israel of going “beyond the scope of self defence” in its bombing of Gaza. On 16 October, Xi Jinping called for a ceasefire “as soon as possible, to avoid the conflict from expanding or even spiralling out of control and causing a serious humanitarian crisis”.
China – which this month became chair of the UN security council – was one of 120 nations to vote for a general assembly ceasefire resolution, and sent a Middle East special envoy, Zhai Jun, to the region.
“Rhetorical support for the Palestinians alongside most of the Arab and Muslim world is relatively cost-free to offer (and frankly, a fair slice of the western world too is very concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and supports a two-state solution),” said Rorry Daniels, the managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute. “But anything more creates a tricky set of consequences that I would assume China seeks to avoid.”
The conflict comes at a time when Beijing is seeking to grow its influence in the Middle East – a region where it has historically not had significant clout – by building on its involvement in brokering a deal earlier this year to normalise relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy in east Asia at King’s College London, who attended a recent security forum in Beijing, said there were signs Beijing was leaning on Iran to prevent further escalation of the conflict as a step towards ceasefire.
“They’re trying to use their acquired influence in the region to see if they can target a fragile and fast evolving situation in a way that allows them to claim – if a victory comes around – that they were part of the solution not the problem.”
Raymond Kuo, a political scientist at the Rand Corporation, said Beijing still didn’t have strong enough influence in the deeply complex region to effect a real solution.
“Beijing might want to act as a mediator, but will it actually put skin in the game, including financial assistance, political pressure, and security support or even guarantees, especially given the region’s complexity? I’m doubtful, especially since it hasn’t been involved thus far.”
Analysts also linked China’s response to its ongoing rivalry with the US, which is a major supporter of Israel and voted against ceasefires at the UN, and its wish to be seen as the more responsible global superpower.
“This is an opportunity to support Beijing’s wider ‘wolf warrior’ narrative of blaming bad things happening internationally on the US,” said Kuo.
Daniels said: “China sees a high priority in the international landscape as preserving its reputation as the leader of the developing world. I think China wants to position itself as a champion of any country or people oppressed by the broader coalition of US allies and partners, as well as a fair broker for dispute settlement and resolution.”
The issue has also allowed Beijing to push back on ongoing accusations about its own human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. On 30 October, China’s embassy in France tweeted a composite image of intact buildings in Xinjiang and a destroyed neighbourhood in Gaza. Tuvia Gering, a researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies’ Israel-China Policy Center in Tel Aviv, said the pictures were designed to say, “We, the Chinese, care about the Muslims. What [the west] is saying about us is blatant lies.”
Among Chinese people there is deep distress over the thousands of people being killed in Israeli strikes. One woman in Beijing tells the Guardian that she and her compatriots sympathise with Palestine because the situation reminds them of the Japanese occupation of China during the second world war.
The conflict has also seen antisemitic discourse rise in China, on social media, and from official voices.
While antisemitism has long existed in China, and flourished in particular in nationalist corners of the internet, analysts note that Beijing’s refusal to condemn Hamas for the 7 October attacks have emboldened a Chinese influencers to voice antisemitic tropes more vigorously. This content has been allowed to flourish on China’s tightly controlled social media, indicating at least a tacit tolerance for racist content. Hashtags that use antisemitic tropes have had tens of millions of views.
Antisemitism in China rises every time there is a conflict involving Israel, said Gering. “But this is on steroids. This is as fast as I’ve ever seen it.” The tone of online discourse was set by state media and official pronouncements, he said.
Much of the online discussion focuses on the destruction wrought by the conflict. But some of the commentary also uses antisemitic tropes to make points that serve Beijing’s geopolitical interests, such as challenging the US’s dominance on the world stage. In an article published on 14 October, Luo Yuan, a retired major general in the People’s Liberation Army, wrote that Israel was a “pawn” planted in the Middle East to execute American interests in the region.
Some tropes have been combined with other recent nationalistic campaigns. On 11 October, one influencer with 2.5 million followers wrote that Jewish people financed Tepco, the Japanese company responsible for discharging wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant – a highly contentious issue in China. Associating Jews with the issue is “like a modern blood libel of the Jews as the well-poisoners”, said Gering. Many of the comments below are explicitly antisemitic, with references to Hitler and Judas. According to Weibo’s community guidelines, users are prohibited from posting “harmful content”, but antisemitic comments remained online weeks after being posted.

"Gaza’s largest hospital being bombarded, WHO says",2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/netanyahu-says-israel-is-not-seeking-to-occupy-gaza,"Attack comes as US secretary of state laments Palestinian death toll and Netanyahu says Israel does not seek to govern territory
The largest hospital in Gaza, where up to 50,000 people are sheltering, is facing bombardment, the World Health Organization has said, as the US’s top diplomat said “far too many Palestinians have been killed” in the war.
Palestinian officials said Israel launched airstrikes on or near four hospitals and a school on Friday, killing at least 22 people. The bombardment came as the territory’s precarious health system struggled to cope with thousands of people wounded or displaced in Israel’s war against Hamas militants.
Graphic daytime videos posted online appeared to show screaming and bloodied people, including children, in the grounds of al-Shifa hospital in the heart of Gaza City. The Reuters news agency said it had verified the footage and that one person had died. Another video, filmed at night-time, reportedly showed the aftermath of an earlier attack.
Emmanuel Macron called for a ceasefire, saying there was “no justification” for Israel’s continued bombardment of Gaza.
Speaking to the BBC on Friday, the French President said: “There is no other solution than first a humanitarian pause, going to a ceasefire, which will allow to protect … all civilians having nothing to do with terrorists.”
“Today, civilians are bombed – de facto. These babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed. So there is no reason for that and no legitimacy. So we do urge Israel to stop,” he said.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that he welcomed Israel’s agreed four-hour humanitarian pauses in its Gaza offensive, but that more needed to be done.
“Far too many Palestinians have been killed. Far too many who suffered these past weeks, and we want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximise the assistance that gets to them,” he said.
Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson, said 20 hospitals in Gaza were out of action and that there was “intense violence” at Shifa. “I haven’t got the detail on al-Shifa but we do know they are coming under bombardment,” she said.
Harris said there was also “significant bombardment” on Rantisi hospital, the only hospital providing paediatric services in north Gaza. She said children had been receiving care such as dialysis and life support – “things that you cannot possibly evacuate them safely with”. The hospital was surrounded by Israeli armoured vehicles on Friday, according to the Agence France-Presse news agency.
At the same briefing, the UN humanitarian office spokesperson Jens Laerke said: “If there is hell on earth today, its name is northern Gaza. It is a life of fear by day and darkness at night and what do you tell your children in such a situation, it’s almost unimaginable – that the fire they see in the sky is out to kill them?”
The Palestinian Red Cross said Israeli snipers shot at al-Quds hospital, to the south of Gaza City, and that there were violent clashes, with one person killed and 28 wounded, most of them children.
“Israel is now launching a war on Gaza City hospitals,” said Mohammad Abu Selmeyah, the director of Shifa.
The Red Cross said medical facilities and workers in Gaza needed to be protected, warning the health system in the territory had “reached a point of no return”.
“The destruction affecting hospitals in Gaza is becoming unbearable and needs to stop,” William Schomburg, head of the ICRC sub-delegation in Gaza, added on Friday.
An Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson said: “Earlier today, the IDF received reports of a hit on the Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The Hamas-run media office in the Gaza Strip immediately claimed that this was a strike carried out by the IDF. An examination of IDF operational systems indicates that a misfired projectile launched by terrorist organisations inside the Gaza Strip hit the Shifa hospital. The misfired projectile was aimed at IDF troops operating in the vicinity.”
In an earlier media briefing, IDF spokesperson Lt Col Richard Hecht said: “The IDF does not fire on hospitals. If we see Hamas terrorists firing from the hospitals, we’ll do what we need to do.
“We’ll take every [pre]caution possible to make sure we don’t come and raid people on drips or with broken bones.”
Israel’s military has long accused Hamas of using civilian institutions as cover for military bases. In a statement on Thursday, the Israeli army said infantry and special forces backed up with air support had raided the military quarters of Hamas near Shifa.
The IDF said Shifa was situated in an area they called “the heart of intelligence and operational activities” for Hamas when it planned the 7 October attacks. Hamas and hospital staff have denied this, saying the IDF is using the allegation as a pretext to strike the hospital.
Early on Friday, strikes hit the courtyard and the obstetrics department of Shifa, according to Ashraf al-Qidra, the Gaza ministry of health spokesperson.
Palestinian media published video footage of Shifa that they said showed the aftermath of an Israeli attack on a car park where displaced Palestinians were sheltered and journalists were observing.
“With ongoing strikes and fighting nearby [Shifa], we are gravely concerned about the wellbeing of thousands of civilians there, many children among them, seeking medical care and shelter,” Human Rights Watch said online.
Qidra added on Friday: “Israeli military tanks are now surrounding hospitals in Gaza including al-Rantisi, Nasser hospital for children, eyes and mental health services.
“Thousands of patients, medical staff and displaced persons are inside the hospitals without access to water, and food and can be targeted any moment.”
At least 20 people were killed in strikes that hit Gaza City’s al-Buraq school, said Abu Selmeyah, the director of Shifa where the dead were taken.
The strikes have triggered a mass exodus of the displaced. Thousands of Palestinians continued to flee south from northern Gaza on Friday, including some of those sheltering at Shifa and Rantisi.
The White House announced on Thursday that Israel would begin to implement four-hour “humanitarian pauses” in parts of the area to allow people to leave.
The US national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said the pauses would allow people to pass along two humanitarian corridors, which he described as “a significant first step”.
But in the hours after the statement there was no sign of a letup in the fighting that has laid waste the coastal territory.
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians since Hamas militants rampaged through southern Israeli communities on 7 October. Officials initially said about 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed in those attacks, but on Friday that figure was revised down to about 1,200.
“This is the updated number,” ministry spokesperson Lior Haiat told AFP. “It is due to the fact that there were lot of corpses that were not identified and now we think those belong to terrorists … not Israeli casualties.”

News outlets deny claims they had prior knowledge of Hamas attack on Israel,2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/news-outlets-reject-claims-prior-knowledge-hamas-attack-israel,"Associated Press, Reuters, New York Times and CNN say suggestions are untrue, outrageous and reckless
Four of the world’s biggest news organisations have vigorously denied any prior knowledge of Hamas’s deadly assault on Israel on 7 October, saying such a suggestion was untrue, outrageous and reckless.
The suggestion appeared in an article by HonestReporting, which describes itself as an organisation devoted to fighting media disinformation about Israel and Zionism. It was taken up by two senior Israeli politicians, who said any journalists with prior knowledge of the assault should be treated as terrorists.
The Associated Press, Reuters, the New York Times and CNN issued robust statements in response to questions about Palestinian photographers in Gaza who documented Hamas’s cross-border raid in which at least 1,400 people were killed.
Gil Hoffman, HonestReporting’s executive director, has since admitted there was no evidence to back up the article’s suggestions, but said “they were legitimate questions to be asked”.
Benny Gantz, a former defence minister who sits in Israel’s war cabinet, said on X, formerly Twitter: “Journalists found to have known about the massacre, and [who] still chose to stand as idle bystanders while children were slaughtered, are no different than terrorists and should be treated as such.”
Danny Danon, a former Israeli ambassador to the UN, said Israel had a list of people it would “eliminate” for participating in the raid, and that journalists who recorded the assault would be “added to that list”. He added: “We will hunt them down together with the terrorists.”
The Israeli prime minister’s office said: “These journalists were accomplices in crimes against humanity; their actions were contrary to professional ethics.”
Some of the photographs sent out by the news agencies were published by the Guardian and other media outlets.
In a statement, the New York Times said the accusation that anyone at the news organisation had advance knowledge of the terrorist attack was “untrue and outrageous”.
It added: “It is reckless to make such allegations, putting our journalists on the ground in Israel and Gaza at risk. The Times has extensively covered the October 7 attacks and the war with fairness, impartiality, and an abiding understanding of the complexities of the conflict.”
Referring to Yousef Masoud, a photojournalist named by HonestReporting and who has worked with the New York Times over the past five weeks, the news organisation said: “There is no evidence for HonestReporting’s insinuations. Our review of [Masoud’s] work shows that he was doing what photojournalists always do during major news events, documenting the tragedy as it unfolded.”
It said freelance photojournalists in conflict areas often “rush into danger to provide first-hand witness accounts and to document important news. This is the essential role of a free press in wartime.”
The Associated Press said it had no knowledge of the 7 October attacks before they happened, and had received photographs from freelancers about an hour after the assault began.
“No AP staff were at the border at the time of the attacks, nor did any AP staffer cross the border at any time. When we accept freelance photos, we take great steps to verify the authenticity of the images and that they show what is purported,” it said.
Reuters said it “categorically denies that it had prior knowledge of the attack or that we embedded journalists with Hamas on October 7. Reuters acquired photographs from two Gaza-based freelance photographers who were at the border on the morning of October 7, with whom it did not have a prior relationship.
“The photographs published by Reuters were taken two hours after Hamas fired rockets across southern Israel and more than 45 minutes after Israel said gunmen had crossed the border. Reuters staff journalists were not on the ground at the locations referred to in the HonestReporting article.”
CNN said: “We had no prior knowledge of the October 7 attacks.”
The AP and CNN said on Thursday they had severed ties with Hassan Eslaiah, a freelance photographer who took images of Hamas gunmen crossing the border. HonestReporting posted a photo of Eslaiah being kissed by the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar.
The US Republican senator Tom Cotton called on the justice department to investigate the media outlets in question, claiming without evidence that the journalists “almost certainly knew about the attack in advance”. In 2020 Cotton caused outrage by calling for the military to be used against “Antifa terrorists” during nationwide US protests for racial justice.
In its article, HonestReporting said: “Hamas terrorists were not the only ones who documented the war crimes they had committed during their deadly rampage across southern Israel. Some of their atrocities were captured by Gaza-based photojournalists working for the Associated Press and Reuters news agencies, whose early morning presence at the breached border area raises serious ethical questions.”
It added: “Is it conceivable to assume that ‘journalists’ just happened to appear early in the morning at the border without prior coordination with the terrorists? Or were they part of the plan?”
At least 39 journalists and media workers have been killed in the Israel-Gaza war so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, making it the deadliest month-long period since records began in 1992. A further eight have been wounded and 13 are missing.
Sherif Mansour, of the CPJ, said: “Journalists are civilians doing important work during times of crisis and must not be targeted by warring parties. Those in Gaza, in particular, have paid, and continue to pay, an unprecedented toll and face exponential threats.”

"Pro-Palestine march will be one of UK’s biggest ever protests, organisers predict",2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/pro-palestine-march-will-be-one-of-uks-biggest-ever-protests-organisers-predict,"Police to put tight controls on protesters’ movements with hundreds of thousands expected at event on Armistice Day
The organisers of the pro-Palestine march due to take place in London on Armistice Day believe “hundreds of thousands” of people will turn out for what they say will be one of Britain’s biggest days of mass protest.
Meanwhile, the Metropolitan police said the policing of the remembrance weekend would be “far greater and more complex than we’ve delivered before” and that officers would draw on “an extensive set of powers to prevent any disruption whatsoever”, with tight controls put on the movements of protesters.
Ben Jamal, the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), a lead organiser of the march, said he understood that people would be travelling from all over the UK to march on Saturday from Park Lane towards the US embassy in south-west London.
On a stage set up near where Nine Elms becomes Battersea Park Road, speeches will be made by the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the actors Juliet Stevenson and Maxine Peake, and the head of the Palestinian mission to the UK, Husam Zomlot, among others.
“We think it is going to be huge,” Jamal said. In a statement issued on the eve of the march, the PSC said: “More than 500,000 people are expected to converge in London, making it one of the largest political marches in British history.”
There is little doubt among senior officers that there will be flashpoints at various times on Saturday, with concerns that groups could splinter off from the main march to cause disruption, and that far-right elements could seek to exploit the occasion.
The organisers’ request for two end points for the march, in order to alleviate the pressure on their stewards, was declined by the police on Thursday. They said they remained confident the event would still pass off peacefully.
People are being asked to assemble at about midday at Park Lane before starting the march at 12.45pm. The route goes past Grosvenor Place and Victoria, then over Vauxhall Road and on to Nine Elms and past the US embassy. Marchers will be asked by organisers to disperse at 4pm, with the police having put a 5pm deadline on when the march must end.
The Met said 1,850 officers would be on duty under the command of the deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor, with a mutual aid system being triggered under which about 780 officers are being called up from outside London. Public order units and other response sections of the Met have had leave cancelled.
The Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has said he is keeping a close watch for any fresh intelligence that suggests there are new grounds to seek a banning order from the home secretary under section 13 of the 1986 Public Order Act.
As with similar previous protests, the march will have conditions imposed upon it under section 12 of the act, meaning that any protesters who diverge from the agreed route from Hyde Park could be liable to a fine of up to £2,500. There will be an exclusion zone covering Whitehall, Horse Guards Parade and the Westminster Abbey Field of Remembrance, from which marchers will be banned.
The Cenotaph will have a dedicated 24-hour police presence across the weekend. Protesters will not be allowed close to the US embassy nor to gather in the streets around the Israeli embassy in High Street Kensington. Anyone who does not disperse from key central London locations including Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus will be liable to be arrested, the Met has said.
Officers have been granted section 60 and 60AA stop and search powers in Westminster and parts of Lambeth and Wandsworth, which include the right to ask a protester to remove an item of clothing that is concealing their identity. “This step is being taken in response to concerns that counter-protesters may be intending to confront those taking part in the main protest march,” the Met said.
Rishi Sunak has said he has been assured by Rowley that the Met will be able to prevent “serious public disorder”, with the government seemingly happy to pin blame on Britain’s most senior police chief in the event of disaster.
The march has been organised by a coalition of groups: the PSC, the Muslim Association of Britain, Friends of Al-Aqsa, Palestinian Forum in Britain, Stop the War and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND).
The chief steward of the protest, Chris Nineham of Stop the War, had the same role for the 15 February 2003 anti-war protest against the invasion of Iraq – the largest ever such event in the UK, when an estimated 1.5 million people marched on the streets of London. He will be directing a team of 500 volunteer stewards on Saturday.
Since Hamas triggered the war with Israel on 7 October by killing 1,400 people and taking approximately 240 hostages, there have been a series of marches and assemblies in London and around the UK calling for a ceasefire. The largest attracted 100,000 people, according to police.
Nineham said: “This will be far and away the biggest of these series of demonstrations. I know it’s going to be a lot bigger than that. Just one coach agency in the north of England has booked 250 coaches for the demo. That’s just one agency.”
He said a complicating factor was that people would not be able to congregate in Hyde Park because of the Winter Wonderland event.
Nineham also raised concerns that the government’s rhetoric could make it more likely that there will be trouble on the margins of the protest, with the founder of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson, among those on the far right seeking to mobilise supporters.
“I think both politically and practically we’re operating in difficult circumstances”, Nineham said. “Partly because, obviously, the government is trying to demonise us and telling lies about haters and stirring up, quite deliberately, opposition to us, and that has been their call in a way, some kind of call to arms, that has actually been answered by Tommy Robinson.”

" Gaza diary part 20: ‘A positive feeling – I saw my friend, we talked, we are still alive’",2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/10/gaza-diary-part-20-a-positive-feeling-i-saw-my-friend-we-talked-we-are-still-alive,"Ziad, a 35-year-old Palestinian, recounts another day in Gaza when, amid the hunger and the shortages, an interminable queue for breakfast becomes a ‘falafel journey’
8am Falafel is one of the most popular traditional foods in Gaza. We call it “the poor people’s food” because it is cheap. Palestinians who travel abroad are surprised at the prices of falafel sandwiches, and I know I speak for everyone in Gaza when I say that we believe the ones made in Gaza are the best.
Luckily for us, in the area we evacuated to there were two shops selling falafel. Unfortunately, one closed soon after we arrived because the owner ran out of gas. But we are among the few neighbourhoods that still have the luxury of getting falafel. The remaining shop works two shifts, one in the morning and one from 3 to 5pm. They no longer sell sandwiches, only falafel, since getting bread is very difficult. I usually go in the evening, because until recently we didn’t eat breakfast. I would wait for about 45 minutes to get my order, but it is OK: now you have to wait for everything, if it is available.
Today, I decide to get some falafel for breakfast. I thought I went early, but the line is so long. I am told that people start queueing shortly after 6am to secure a spot. I try to count how many people are ahead of me and get tired after 85. I see my friend so we stand together and decide to spend “the journey of getting falafel” together. I send a message to my sister telling her it will probably take me a long time to return.
8.30am “In the sea?” I ask, surprised.
“Yes,” my friend answers.
We are talking about how miserable the situation is for people displaced in schools and hospitals. While waiting in line, I noticed a lot of flies buzzing around the neck of a man standing ahead of us. It is no surprise – people haven’t had access to hygiene facilities for more than a month now. Only the lucky ones have access to water, or at least money to buy deodorant.
My friend tells me that some displaced people who are next to the sea go there to wash themselves. “You would see mostly men and children. But even women go there to clean themselves. I know how annoying it is to have the remains of the salty seawater over your body, but it is better than being filthy.”
9am We have moved a little forward. My friend starts having a conversation with two men about six or seven places ahead of us. I take the opportunity to make some phone calls, checking on my friends. I can’t reach most of them due to the unreliable connection – at least that is what I tell myself, trying not to think about any bad thing that could have happened to them overnight. Finally, I get through to one who is a pharmacist.
Pharmacists these days are suffering. In the absence of effective hospitals and clinics, and with the difficulties in seeing a doctor, people go to pharmacies for medical support.
Every time I go to the pharmacy, which is a lot these days, I see pharmacists checking children, adults’ aches and pains, and hearing different symptoms of sick people, some of which are very complicated. People hope to get something to help them survive until they can see a doctor.
My friend tells me about a customer of his who called to remind him that she owed him some money, and she wanted him to forgive her in case something bad happened to her. “I was surprised. I told her that of course I forgave her, and we would meet after this is all over and she can pay me. Unfortunately, two days later, she and her family died.”
10am Standing in line, several arguments start about people jumping the queue. The owner of the shop has to come out and maintain order. It feels as if he is a school principal, but I understand that he wants things to move smoothly. Apparently, this situation has been going on for a month now. I was lucky not to eat breakfast before.
The shop owner is a kind guy. He makes his shop available to everyone to come and charge their phones and UPS batteries. One time I was passing and saw hundreds of devices connected to cords inside and outside the shop.
I think of the owner of another shop I was at the other day. I joked with him: “I bet us people who came from Gaza City or the north are annoying you now, so many of us and all our needs.” He smiled and said: “Not at all. If we don’t welcome you in the difficult times, when will we? You are people in need and it is our duty to help.” I later found out that he and his wife had left their home and moved in with their son to allow families from Gaza City to stay in his place.
10.30am We are still waiting in line. I ask my friend about his family and he says they are OK. He says: “I was talking to a friend and he wanted to tell me about something that happened to my house. I shut him up and asked him not to finish his sentence. If something happened to my house, I don’t want to know about it now. If we get out of this alive, I will deal with it later. I have no space to mourn the loss of my house.”
11am After standing in line for hours, they let groups of people enter, buy their falafel and leave. Now, we are inside with about 20 other people. No line any more, so everyone tries to get their order first. Everyone is frustrated. I hear a man saying that if it were up to him, he wouldn’t even eat, but he needs to get breakfast for his children “and there are no other options”.
11.30am We get the falafel. On our way out, the people still waiting jokingly start shouting: “Congratulations!” and saying phrases usually said when someone has a new baby.
Since the beginning of the whole situation, I have not taken a single picture of myself or anyone else. I believe that pictures are a way to keep great memories to look back on, but from these days there is nothing great or beautiful to remember.
However, I ask my friend if we could take a picture. “Looking like this?” he asks. I say yes. I suggest we get the falafel in the picture, but he refuses – he has boundaries. We put the falafel down and take the picture. I smile from ear to ear. I an not happy, and I am not pretending to be. But I have a positive feeling, I don’t know what it is, it is just that I saw my friend, we talked, we are still alive. It is a new day (or to be more precise, the middle of a new day now), and – we got falafel!

‘Our wish is to be martyred’: defiant Hamas fighters count their losses in West Bank,2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/funerals-for-west-bank-dead-jenin-israel-hamas-war,"Hundreds of men, some armed, march with bodies of the dead through Jenin as violence escalates
At 8.30 on Friday morning, Jenin’s morgue was crowded. Outside, dozens of young men in black baseball caps, T-shirts and jeans stood quietly, some with their weapons between their knees, their green Hamas headbands tied tight across their foreheads. Older men sat in front of shuttered shops.
Inside, a metal door was opened and a corpse wrapped in the green flag of Hamas was drawn out on a stretcher. A teenager with an assault rifle in one hand touched the dead man lightly on the forehead, then helped to shoulder the stretcher and with five others set out through the throng, down the rubble-strewn streets to the home of Hamed Fayed, where the women of the family waited.
Moments later, a second body, wrapped in the black flag of Islamic Jihad, was carried out. Then a third body, a fourth, and more.
As the Israeli offensive in Gaza continues, a month after the Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 Israelis, mainly civilians, and wounded many more, levels of violence in the occupied West Bank are rising fast. Nineteen Palestinians were killed across the territory on Thursday as clashes took place with the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), 14 in the small northern town of Jenin. Casualties were aged from 15 to 40, and included several civilians. Since 7 October, 167 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces; and a further eight, including one child, have been killed by Israeli settlers. Three Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians according to the UN.
Jenin has long been a flashpoint between Hamas and Israeli security forces, outside the practical control of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and a stronghold of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. A major and bloody operation was launched in the town’s main refugee camp in July and there have been clashes throughout the summer. These have intensified dramatically in the last month.
On Thursday, according to Israeli media quoting IDF statements, the IDF launched a counter-terrorism operation during which forces exchanged fire with armed terrorists.
“I have never seen anything like these days,” said Ayman Zaid, a nursing supervisor at Jenin’s main hospital, where the dead and wounded were brought in late on Thursday evening as the fighting finally ebbed. “They brought them in around 8pm. No one could get to the hospital before. We had casualties bleeding out in the street.”
Hamed Fayed, 19, was shot during fighting between Hamas and the IDF in the maze of narrow streets about 500 metres from the hospital on Thursday morning. Neighbours said the IDF had first moved into the town during the night, then returned in the morning.
“They came in for three hours, with full power. We went out to fight them. They had drones and they are really dangerous,” said a friend of the dead man, who did not want to give his name. “Most of the martyrs were killed by drones but there was very close combat. Hamed went to shoot an [Israeli] sniper but the sniper shot him.
“We were together all the time. He was my brother. I have been his friend since third grade. He was a very nice person, a very aggressive fighter. He was never afraid. This will strengthen us but we are carrying our weapons to be martyred. Of course he is a lucky one. He is a martyr. I am happy for him. This is my wish too. Our wish is to be martyred. But I miss him, of course. We used to play soccer and go swimming every day.”
The strap of the man’s assault rifle contained a tiny Qur’an. On a magazine of ammunition was a picture of another “martyr”.
Israeli intelligence officials have claimed to the Guardian that the successive operations of the IDF in the West Bank, and the detention of between 1,000 and 2,200 people since 7 October, are necessary to stop further terrorist attacks. According to the IDF, substantial number of those arrested are members of Hamas, which is listed as a terrorist organisation by the US, UK and several other nations. One official claimed that those now held in the West Bank were plotting strikes into Israel. .
As the corpse of Fayed was brought close to his small home, sobbing and cries could be heard, amplified by the narrow alley. The corpse was briefly taken into the home among tearful relatives. Armed men outside fired in the air and then shouldered Fayed’s remains again for the journey to the cemetery.
Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to crush Hamas and to eliminate its leaders and as many of its lower ranks as necessary to make impossible any repetition of the terrorist attacks of last month.
Hamas militants and relatives of some of those killed on Thursday said Gaza, where more than 11,000 have been killed since the Israeli offensive began, and the West Bank were “brothers”. “If [the Israelis] are attacking them in Gaza and killing them there, what do they expect us to do, stand with our hands in our pockets?” said Lutfi Sayed, whose cousin was killed on Thursday.
Hamas has been responsible for dozens of deadly suicide attacks against Israeli civilians over recent decades, and Israeli security agencies fear a fresh surge of violence from the West Bank in this current conflict. But the aim of eliminating the organisation, founded in Gaza in 1987, is not an easy one. Though established only in pockets of the West Bank, Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group can deploy significant numbers of militants for terrorist attacks or more conventional fighting.
Hundreds, possibly thousands of men, many young and armed, marched with the bodies of the dead through the centre of Jenin on Friday morning. Posters of dead “martyrs” cover every wall, and slogans celebrating their deaths are ubiquitous. On almost every street corner were groups of armed young men, standing with their weapons, sometimes wearing balaclavas or face masks, but often making no effort to conceal their features. Most wore either the green headband of Hamas or the black of Islamic Jihad.
After the march, mosques filled for Friday prayers. Outside al-Ansar mosque, elderly men and seven-year-olds lined up to pray below walls marked by recent clashes, pocked and cracked by bullets and shrapnel. Assault rifles were leant against walls as their owners kneeled and bowed their heads.
“We have seen the killing of our uncles, fathers, brothers and sons,” said one heavily armed militant, 30, who said he had joined Hamas when he was 17. “I would have liked to travel, live my life, have my freedom. I wanted to be a teacher. But we are fighting instead and God willing we will win.” He praised the Hamas attacks on Israel last month and called for more.
During prayers, speakers relayed the sermon. In pauses in the speech, static cracked, while a drone buzzed overhead. The imam saved his fiercest criticism not for Israel but for the Arab powers that he said had betrayed Gaza.
“You cannot count on the Arab leaders for liberating Gaza. They are accomplices of the Israelis and they are the real enemy,” he said. “We will have to liberate Gaza ourselves, and now we know Israel is weak, as weak as a spider’s web.”

How pro-Palestinian marches have caused crises for Tories and Labour,2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/10/how-pro-palestinian-marches-have-caused-crises-for-tories-and-labour,"While Sunak deals with Braverman’s claims against protesters and police, Starmer faces pressure to support Gaza ceasefire
At midday on Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people will gather outside Hyde Park in London for what organisers say will be the biggest pro-Palestinian march since the Israel-Hamas war broke out just over a month ago.
The marchers will hope their calls for a ceasefire in Gaza put pressure on the British government to do the same. But even before they have taken a step, the protesters have triggered political crises for both of Britain’s largest parties, leaving the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, looking weaker than he has for months and the home secretary, Suella Braverman, facing the sack.
“I’m not sure if they meant it but this demonstration has managed to cause major crises for both parties,” said one Labour MP. “Which is impressive given it hasn’t even happened yet.”
For Rishi Sunak, the week was supposed to be about him. The prime minister oversaw his first king’s speech on Tuesday, launching a series of bills on everything from tenants’ rights to smoking, as he sought to reinvigorate his party before a likely election next year.
Instead, it is his home secretary who has dominated the headlines, first calling homelessness a “lifestyle choice” and then openly criticising the Metropolitan police for allowing this weekend’s protests to go ahead.
Her words have irritated many on the Tory benches, who believe she is positioning herself for a leadership bid should the Tories lose the next election, and some of whom have jokingly nicknamed her “Cruella”.
It is the way she has gone about courting attention that has particularly irritated Downing Street. Hours after Sunak made clear his backing for the Met’s decision to allow the march on Saturday, the Times ran a controversial article by Braverman accusing the police force of being biased towards leftwing causes and comparing the marchers to dissidents in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.
What was worse for Sunak’s advisers was that they had demanded major changes to the piece, only to find it had been published largely in its original form without several of their edits.
Downing Street said on Friday that Braverman retained the prime minister’s confidence, but officials are investigating how the article came to be published in that form, and Sunak is reported to be considering a formal investigation into whether Braverman broke the ministerial code.
For many Tory MPs, the row typifies the way in which Braverman has repeatedly tried to weaponise controversial issues to bolster her rightwing credentials before what many expect will be a leadership contest after the next election. Many are getting so exasperated that they are calling into question whether she would have the parliamentary support to get into the final two in such a contest.
“People are just tired of it now,” said one senior Tory MP. “She’s pissing everyone off.”
Some believe Sunak was already planning to move Braverman in a reshuffle that could come as soon as next week, and that her latest manoeuvres are designed to make it look as if she has deliberately prompted it.
“She is trying to make it look like she made it happen (or can prevent it with pressure), rather than she was just sacked for her current mess,” said one Conservative backbencher.
Braverman still has her close allies, including John Hayes, Miriam Cates and Jonathan Gullis. But what has annoyed many of her otherwise sympathetic colleagues is the way her actions have overshadowed what should have been a bruising week for Labour.
For all the divisions that Saturday’s march has triggered among Conservatives, the situation is more serious on the Labour benches, where many MPs are under heavy pressure from their members and constituents to back a ceasefire.
Those tensions came to a head this week when Imran Hussain resigned as a shadow minister in the levelling up team, saying he wanted to be a stronger advocate for a ceasefire.

Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters
after newsletter promotion
Labour whips are watching more than a dozen other shadow ministers for signs they might resign, with the weekend’s march and an expected parliamentary vote on a ceasefire next week expected to prove flashpoints.
Labour MPs say they are mostly willing to comply with an instruction from the leader’s office not to attend Saturday’s march. They will find it harder to vote against a likely motion by the Scottish National party calling for Israel to end its military campaign in Gaza.
Party whips are so worried about a potential vote that they are spending the weekend calling Labour MPs around the country asking whether allowing them to abstain on the vote would be enough to ward off a rebellion.
With Labour now more than 20 points ahead in the polls, potential rebels insist they do not want to bring down Starmer. A mass rebellion by his frontbenchers would challenge his authority on a scale unseen since the early days of his leadership, when he took on and expelled many on the left of the party.
For all the angst within both parties over how to respond to fast-moving events in the Middle East and the reaction back home, polls suggest most voters are not particularly engaged with the issue.
“Voters are evenly split on whether their sympathies lie more with Israel or the Palestinians,” said Anthony Wells, the head of UK political research at YouGov. “But there are a lot of ‘don’t knows’, and the salience is low. This is much more of an internal issue for political parties than it is one for voters generally.”
Bronwen Maddox, the chief executive of the Chatham House foreign policy thinktank, said: “For all the traditional support for the Palestinian cause within Labour that has given Sir Keir Starmer recent trouble, the challenge of policy and tone for both main parties is similar.”
The positions of Starmer and Braverman are likely to become a lot clearer on Wednesday. That is the day any parliamentary vote on a ceasefire is likely to be held, and by chance it is also the day the supreme court is due to decide on whether Braverman’s policy of deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda is lawful.
“Come Thursday we should know whether Starmer has enough authority in his party to face down rebels over Gaza, and whether Sunak has enough in his to sack his home secretary,” said one MP.

Labour MPs urged not to back SNP Middle East ceasefire motion,2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/10/labour-mps-urged-not-to-back-snp-middle-east-ceasefire-motion,"Script for party whips seen by the Guardian says ‘votes will not change the facts on the ground’
Labour figures are urging MPs not to “undermine the party in Scotland” by supporting the SNP motion demanding a ceasefire next week, the Guardian understands.
Keir Starmer is facing a rebellion by as many as a dozen shadow ministers, who sources say are ready to resign rather than vote against calling for a ceasefire in the Middle East, which Starmer has refused to back.
Whips in Starmer’s party have been tasked with ringing round MPs, including frontbenchers, to make it “clear that [Labour MPs] shouldn’t make Wednesday about the Labour party”.
When the Commons’ king’s speech debate comes to an end on Wednesday, it is likely there will be a vote on the SNP’s amendment, which calls on the government to “join with the international community in urgently pressing all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire”.
A script seen by the Guardian instructs party whips to be firm with frontbenchers, and “point out that if Labour was in government they would have to vote against”.
It came after Starmer said he understood the “emotions” behind the ceasefire calls of some in the party.The script begins with MPs being reassured: “How are you? We know things are difficult and we’re trying to do all we can to help.”
The text later becomes firmer however: “These votes will not change the facts on the ground … The choice on Wednesday is to stick together or to support the SNP over the Labour party and undermine our party in Scotland.”
At least 68 Labour MPs have in some form called for a ceasefire, with many supporting Zarah Sultana’s backbench Labour amendment seeking one immediately.
The pressure on Starmer’s authority comes from the 17 frontbenchers who have put out statements or written or shared posts on social media also calling for an immediate end to the conflict.
Labour officials have not yet decided whether the party will vote at all as they “don’t usually vote on SNP motions”, but they are “seeking to find a route through for everyone”.
“Supporting the SNP motion would undermine the Labour party in Scotland and isn’t in line with our policy position. We will therefore not be supporting the SNP motion,” whips will tell MPs.
It comes weeks after Labour won a stunning victory in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West byelection, with the Scottish Labour leader ,Anas Sarwar, saying it was “proof that Scotland will lead the way in delivering a UK Labour government”.
Pollsters said the level of support in that byelection put Labour within touching distance of winning the next Holyrood election in 2026 as Labour strategists stated they could win 28 Scottish seats, nearly all from the SNP.
Some insiders have pointed to the latest YouGov polling to prove Labour has been so far unaffected by it deep splits over the party’s position on the Israel-Gaza conflict, and may be unaffected by the frustrations of Muslim members.
But Starmer’s position was put under intense pressure after Sarwar attacked the Labour leader for his refusal to call for a ceasefire alongside the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who has the biggest Labour mandate, and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham.
One Labour source said: “This shows how poor Starmer’s political judgment is at the moment. Why can’t MPs have a free vote while Starmer explains his position as a leader and listens? He’s been so lucky with how poor the Tories have been.”
Earlier this week, insiders told the Guardian four shadow ministers were prepared to quit in the coming days, with up to 10 others on “resignation watch”. A source noted: “A week is a long time in politics.”
Many Labour MPs say they are under huge pressure from party members and constituents to take a firmer stance against the Israeli invasion of Gaza, as tens of thousands of people are expected to take part in pro-Palestinian protests in London this weekend.

Braverman’s fate in the balance as Sunak faces growing pressure to sack her,2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/10/jeremy-hunt-distances-himself-from-suella-braverman-as-pressure-mounts-on-pm-to-sack-her,"Jeremy Hunt is latest senior Tory to refuse to back home secretary over her remarks on police and protests
Suella Braverman appears set to remain as home secretary over a weekend of remembrance ceremonies and protests, although her fate is still deeply uncertain after Jeremy Hunt joined the ministerial voices distancing themselves from her views.
Rishi Sunak is under intense pressure to dismiss Braverman after she wrote an article for the Times arguing the police were biased in the way they deal with different protests, a view not fully cleared in advance by Downing Street.
The prime minister’s spokesperson said on Friday that an “ongoing internal process” within No 10 into the article was taking place and that there were no updates on what might happen to Braverman.
However, it is understood that even if Sunak has already decided to sack Braverman for what was a flagrant challenge to his authority, this will not happen until next week at the earliest, given the sensitivities of this weekend.
Braverman will join the prime minister at the Cenotaph on Sunday for the remembrance ceremony, and Sunak has a packed schedule of events connected to the military and veterans.
On Saturday, Armistice Day, there is the possibility of unrest as pro-Palestine marchers demonstrate in central London. While this will take place after the 11am silence, and the route will not go near the Cenotaph, Downing Street said Sunak still believed the planned protest to be “disrespectful”.
A number of right-leaning groups have pledged to stage counter-protests. If there are clashes, the rhetoric of Braverman could be under scrutiny as to whether it might have inflamed tensions.
“Our collective focus working with the Home Office and other colleagues in government now is on ensuring that remembrance events this weekend are protected from disruption and that veterans and those gathering to mark Remembrance Sunday and in the Jewish community do not face unacceptable intimidation,” Sunak’s spokesperson said.
Saying that the prime minister viewed both the pro-Palestine protest and any counter-demonstrations as disrespectful, the spokesperson would not say if Sunak and Braverman had spoken since the Times article was published, saying there would not be a “running commentary” on the inquiry process.
There is, nonetheless, considerable anger within No 10 at the fact Braverman’s article ran without changes ordered by Sunak’s team, with increasingly few of her fellow ministers willing to endorse her argument that police tend to be softer on leftwing protesters than those from the right.
There is also upset at Braverman’s comparison of pro-Palestine activists to marchers in Northern Ireland, largely unionists, with whom the Conservatives are generally allied.
A number of right-leaning Tory backbenchers have spoken out in favour of Braverman, with Sunak facing a potentially significant internal row if she is sacked.
Asked on Friday whether he endorsed the sentiments, Hunt, the chancellor, said: “As many other cabinet ministers have said, the words that she used are not words that I myself would have used. But I have a productive relationship with her as a colleague and I have always given her the money that she needs to fund police, bring down crime and to fund the immigration and asylum system.”
Sunak’s spokesperson hinted that the prime minister also took a different view to Braverman. Asked whether he agreed with the home secretary, given Sunak had expressed very different sentiments, she said: “You have the prime minister’s words on this issue.”
It adds to a tumultuous week for Braverman. who is facing growing criticism over her language over both policing and homelessness, which she has separately described as a “lifestyle choice”.
As Sunak considers Braverman’s fate, a growing number of ministers are either distancing themselves from her language or openly criticising it.
Asked by LBC whether he would have written an article without getting prime ministerial clearance, the education minister Robert Halfon said: “No, I wouldn’t. Everything that I do in terms of articles or speeches, of course, must be signed off by No 10.”
Separately, Halfon told the BBC the decision over whether Braverman should stay in her job was “up to the prime minister”, adding: “It’s way beyond my paygrade in terms of who is in what position in his cabinet.”

Israel women’s groups warn of failure to keep evidence of sexual violence in Hamas attacks,2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/israel-womens-groups-warn-of-failure-to-keep-evidence-of-sexual-violence-in-hamas-attacks,"Rights groups fear lack of investigative work means gender-based nature of some of violence has been overlooked
 Warning: contains graphic descriptions of violence
Women’s rights groups in Israel have warned of significant failings in preserving forensic evidence that could have shone a light on the scale of sexual violence committed against women and girls in last month’s Hamas attacks.
Several incidents of sexual assault and rape from 7 October have been documented by Hamas body camera footage, CCTV, material uploaded to social media, and photographs and videos taken by civilians and first responders, according to several people involved in analysing the footage. Survivor and witness testimonies, many from the Supernova rave, describe seeing women being raped before they were shot.
Many of the atrocities committed by Hamas, as well as what are believed to be civilians or criminal gangs from Gaza who also took advantage of the chaos, have been included by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) in a 40-minute reel of war crimes, screened to journalists and politicians. However, the most distressing material has not been released, on the grounds that it is too difficult to watch, and to preserve the victims’ dignity.
A major worry for Israeli women’s rights groups is that it also appears that very little, if any, investigative work was done to document sexual violence before bodies were returned to their families for funerals, meaning that the gender-based nature of some of the violence has largely gone under the radar in Israeli and international media.
Tal Hochman, a government relations officer at the Israel Women’s Network, said: “Most of the women who were raped were then killed, and we will never understand the full picture, because either bodies were burned too badly or the victims were buried and the forensic evidence buried too. No samples were taken.
“Women are not believed when they report sexual violence even in normal times, and now that chance for justice and dignity has been lost. There are some survivors we are working with or are being treated privately. We also have no idea about what is happening to women currently being held by Hamas in Gaza,” she said.
“We issued an urgent letter to UN Women, and to the UN committee on sexual violence, but so far they have failed to condemn what happened on 7 October in relation to the use of sexual violence committed by Hamas as a tactic of war.”
A report published by the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth suggested that much evidence from the scenes of the attacks that hit more than 20 different locations across southern Israel had not been properly photographed, preserved or forensically examined before bodies were buried, partly because the investigations were carried out by four different organisations without coordination. It also alleged that people were allowed to return to the sites too early, potentially damaging evidence.
The lack of a synchronised collection system could mean that a full accounting of the violence would never be reached, and could hinder attempts at justice in international legal forums, the paper said, referencing by way of comparison the painstaking work undertaken by the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office in documenting Russian war crimes.
In a response to Yedioth Ahronoth’s article, Israel’s ministry of justice said: “The allegations of negligence on the part of the state are irresponsible and have no basis.” It added that “since 7 October, intensive investigative and legal activity has been carried out, with an overall view of the entire terrorist attack, in all its aspects,” in cooperation with the police, Israel’s internal security service and the IDF, under the supervision of the state attorney’s office.
A volunteer who gave her name as Sherry, speaking to journalists at the Shura base, where Israel has been identifying bodies, said: “We have seen women who have been raped, from the age of children through to the elderly.”
A first responder, Simcha Greeneman, said that in Kfar Aza, a kibbutz, his team found a woman who was naked from the waist down who had been bent over a bed and then shot in the back of the head, with a live grenade put in her hand. In Be’eri, a kibbutz where about 100 people were killed, an Israeli special forces sergeant described finding the body of a teenage girl lying naked and face down on her bed with evidence of sexual violence, who had also been shot in the head.
Lt Tamar Bar Shimon, who survived the attack at the Erez military base attached to the Gaza Strip’s only civilian crossing into Israel, has testified that a Hamas man tried to take her clothes off, another stopped him, and they left the room in which she was hiding.
Rape and sexual assault are considered war crimes and a breach of international humanitarian law. Israeli intelligence officials, experts and sources with direct knowledge of interrogation reports of captured Hamas fighters think units that attacked were given a text drawing on a controversial and contested interpretation of traditional Islamic military jurisprudence, claiming that captives are “the spoils of war”. This potentially legitimised the capture of civilians and other abuses by Hamas, without being an explicit instruction to do so.
These units were supposedly the ones detailed to take captives as opposed to killing people or holding the perimeter against Israeli security forces when they arrived. In leaked details from interrogation reports of captured Hamas personnel, at least one man appears to have said his commander told the men that when it came to women and children, “do whatever you want”.
Israel is collecting visual, digital and forensic evidence from 7 October for a war crimes and a crimes against humanity investigation. The international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague will be supplied with the testimony for its continuing investigation into allegations of war crimes in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, as will courts in other countries whose citizens were victims of the massacres, where perpetrators could be tried under the principle of universal jurisdiction.
Although Hamas’s cross-border attack from Gaza on 7 October was in Israel, it still falls within the ICC’s jurisdiction because the Palestinian armed group operates from within the area under the court’s purview.
Israel has previously said it is not subject to the ICC’s authority because it did not sign the Rome statute that established the court and came into force in 2002.

Palestinian Christians call on Justin Welby to ‘speak truth to power’,2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/palestinian-christians-in-jerusalem-call-on-justin-welby-to-speak-truth-to-power,"Letter to archbishop of Canterbury expresses concern about Anglican leaders’ support for UK stance on Israel-Hamas war
Palestinian Christians have restated their criticism of the archbishop of Canterbury over his public statements on the Israel-Hamas war, demanding he “speak truth to power for the sake of a just and lasting peace”.
A letter to Justin Welby, the leader of the global Anglican communion, from Palestinian Christians in the diocese of Jerusalem came shortly after Anglicans in the West Bank accused the archbishop of “relegating” their plight.
The two letters suggest frustration is growing, exacerbated by the lack of response from Welby’s office to the first letter. Lambeth Palace, the London headquarters of the archbishop, is understood to have not replied as there were no named signatories on the letter.
The second letter came from churches in Amman, Jordan, which make up the largest parish in the diocese of Jerusalem. Their congregations are overwhelmingly Palestinian Christian refugees forced to leave their homes in 1948, and their descendants.
The letter states the signatories’ opposition to “acts of violence against any civilians” before saying: “We continue to have concerns, as expressed by others, that the British government’s relationships with Jewish leaders matter more to Anglican leaders than the basic principles of justice, freedom and the right of return for the oldest Christian community in the world.”
It adds: “We ask for your support to speak truth to power for the sake of a just and lasting peace, and to avoid any remarks that can be interpreted as siding with Israeli politicians who seek to oppress and displace the Palestinian people or who seek to challenge a Christian presence in the Holy Land.”
The letter also speaks of Israel’s “denial of national rights to the Palestinian people” and of extremists in the Israeli government who aim to block “Palestinian dreams for a national home … in the Holy Land”.
Since 1948, Israel has “engaged in a campaign widely described as ethnic cleansing, apartheid and other genocide against the Palestinian people”, the letter says.
Last month, Welby spent four days in Jerusalem to “show solidarity … with the Christian community in the Holy Land”, according to his website.
After the visit, Palestinian Anglicans in the West Bank said his statements were shaped by “domestic British ecumenical and political considerations” rather than recognition of “the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in general, and of the Anglican Palestinian community in particular”.
In a statement issued on 31 October, Church of England bishops appealed for “immediate humanitarian pauses … holding out hope for a ceasefire in the longer term”.
A spokesperson for Lambeth Palace confirmed receipt of the second letter and pointed to its response to the first letter, where Lambeth Palace said it remained “in solidarity with all the Christians of the Holy Land”.

"Civilian death rate in Israeli airstrikes higher than in past conflicts, study finds",2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/civilian-death-rate-in-israeli-airstrikes-higher-than-in-past-conflicts-study-finds,"Monitoring group says increased fatality average in latest Gaza air campaign may indicate shift in strategy
Each recorded fatal Israeli airstrike on Gaza since 7 October has caused an average of 10.1 civilian deaths, a monitoring group has said, amid warnings that reported civilian casualty figures are likely to be an underestimate.
The fatality average is far higher than in the three previous Israeli air campaigns in Gaza, of which the most deadly was Operation Protective Edge in the summer of 2014, where the equivalent figure was 2.5.
Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) said the higher figure this time implied there had been a notable change in Israel’s targeting approach – although the figure is lower than in other recent battles in Iraq and Syria.
Iain Overton, the group’s executive director, said: “This isn’t just a statistical concern, it’s a human one. The numbers suggest a potential shift in military strategy that has had devastating consequences for non-combatants.”
He said the higher rate of civilian casualties raised concerns that international humanitarian law had been breached during the month-long intense bombing of Gaza.
Israel denies that civilians or civilian infrastructure are the target of its attacks, arguing that its focus is to remove Hamas fighters from northern Gaza.
On Friday, during a visit to Delhi, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said that while Washington appreciated Israeli efforts to minimise civilian casualties in its bombing campaign, these needed to go further.
He said “far too many” Palestinians had died and more needed to be done to protect lives. The US has proposed that Israel introduce longer humanitarian pauses in the fighting and increase the amount of aid getting into Gaza.
The civilian casualty figures are based on the same methodology for each conflict. Averages are derived from analysis of reputable English-language media reports of airstrikes where any deaths of civilians are cited. During two other Israeli air campaigns in Gaza, in 2012 and 2021, the averages were 1.3 and 1.7 respectively.
The monitoring group derived its average for the conflict based on media reports of 276 airstrikes that caused fatalities. A total of 2,798 Palestinians were reported to have been killed in the incidents monitored and a further 1,306 were injured.
Overton said he believed the high deaths per airstrike figure relative to previous conflicts in Gaza could indicate that the overall civilian death toll is higher than has been reported so far. According to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, a total of 11,078 Palestinians, including 4,500 children, have been killed.
Israel’s air force says it has fired more than 8,000 munitions into Gaza, hitting more than 12,000 targets. Guardian analysis published last weekend identified 1,000 craters visible from space within approximately 10 sq km in northern Gaza.
The average numbers reported killed per casualty-causing airstrike is lower than seen in two other major urban battles in the Middle East. According to AOAV, the capture of Mosul from Islamic State by Iraqi and western forces in March 2017 led to the deaths of 20.7 civilians per recorded strike.
The Russian and Syrian government assault on Aleppo in 2016 was more deadly still, with an average of 22.9 fatalities per reported airstrike.
This week, a US official also said the Palestinian death toll could be higher than was reported. Barbara Leaf, the assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, told the House committee on foreign relations that the overall casualty numbers were “very high, frankly – and it could be that they’re even higher than are being cited”.

The Guardian view on Israel’s political strategy: it cannot just be unassailable military strength | Editorial,2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/10/the-guardian-view-on-israels-political-strategy-it-cannot-just-be-unassailable-military-strength,"The country’s approach to the Palestinians has been shaped by the political right for a decade. It’s not working
Israel has some of the most advanced armed forces in the world, but in its war against Hamas it lacks an equally sophisticated political strategy. The humanitarian catastrophe occurring in Gaza is taking on frightening dimensions. Bread is running out. Scabies and diarrhoea rip through overcrowded shelters. Brackish water is making people sick. Even US officials now admit the civilian death toll is likely to be far higher than the 10,000 reported. It is talking, not fighting, that will end the war.
The absence of a sustainable peace plan divides Israel and its allies. When Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Israeli forces could be in Gaza indefinitely, Washington made it clear it wanted no permanent reoccupation. Mr Netanyahu backed down. But he has not ruled out shrinking Gaza’s territory to create a “buffer zone” or forcibly displacing Palestinians. Mr Netanyahu leads the most rightwing government in Israel’s history: one minister recently suggested dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza.
Israel, which lost 1,400 people in a single day of horrific Hamas violence, remains in a deep state of shock. It is not only the loss of life that Israel is dealing with. Many Israelis also personally feel they are in danger, no matter where they live in the country. Mr Netanyahu was wrong to reject a ceasefire-for-hostages deal in Gaza. Freeing innocents from Hamas’s clutches need not stand in the way of making sure the militants pay for their atrocities.
What is also at stake is whether Israel’s leadership can continue with a policy of active and unrelenting hostility towards the Palestinians. This political strategy sought through unassailable military strength to end claims for an independent Palestinian state over the West Bank and Gaza with a capital city in East Jerusalem. Paradoxically, this meant strengthening the extremist elements among the Palestinians, who also rejected the two-state solution.
Mr Netanyahu has said for years that he will never permit a Palestinian state, and has spent his entire career fighting against the idea. It was Donald Trump who backed Mr Netanyahu, leaving 5 million Palestinians without an honest broker in the Middle East. Much of the world had also given up on the conflict’s honourable resolution, in view of Israel’s steady building of illegal settlements in the West Bank and a divided Palestinian leadership. Just a week before 7 October, US officials were boasting that “the region is quieter today than it has been in two decades”. Those words ring hollow today.
Earlier this month, Israel’s prime minister said his country faced a “long war” in Gaza. But how long and to what end? Modern Israel’s longest war to date was a clash with Hamas five years ago that took almost two months. The longer the fighting, the more likely war spreads to nearby countries and the higher the Palestinian civilian death toll. The latter statistic is a recruiting sergeant for Hamas, prompting Joe Biden’s top military adviser to warn that time is short in Gaza for the Israelis.
But it is not clear if these are the voices that Mr Netanyahu is listening to. Unfortunately, he is more likely to hear the words of his younger brother, Iddo, who wrote last Thursday that only the urgent “terrible fear of our power” could pacify Palestinians, rather than Israel waiting for them to rid themselves of “abysmal hatred”. It is this approach, and thinking, that has failed both Israelis and Palestinians – and needs to change.

Israel to start ‘pauses’ in fighting – as it happened,2023-11-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/09/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-who-disease-gaza-us-strikes-iran-site-syria,"This blog is now closed
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday his country does not seek to conquer, occupy or govern Gaza after its war against Hamas but a “credible force” would be needed to enter the Palestinian territory if necessary to prevent the emergence of militant threats.
Netanyahu’s comments this week suggesting that Israel would be responsible for Gaza security indefinitely drew pushback from the United States, Israel’s main ally.
Washington has said it would oppose Israeli post-war occupation of Gaza, where Israel has waged a bombing campaign to destroy the enclave’s Hamas rulers after militants rampaged through southern Israeli communities on 7 October in an attack that Israel says killed 1,400 people.
Speaking to US television’s Fox News on Thursday, Netanyahu said: “We don’t seek to conquer Gaza, we don’t seek to occupy Gaza, and we don’t seek to govern Gaza”.
Netanyahu said a civilian government would need to take shape in Gaza but that Israel would make sure an attack like 7 October does not happen again.
“So, we have to have credible force that, if necessary, will enter Gaza and kill the killers. Because that’s what will prevent the reemergence of a Hamas-like entity,” Netanyahu said.
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 10,800 Palestinians, according to health officials there. A humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded as basic supplies run out and wounded people overwhelm a fragile medical system.
US officials say the Palestinian Authority (PA), which has limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, should return to govern Gaza after the war. Hamas seized control of Gaza from the PA forces of President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007.
Top Palestinian officials, including Abbas, say a PA return to Gaza must be accompanied by a political solution that ends Israel’s occupation of territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Netanyahu said that after the war, “what we have to see is Gaza demilitarised, deradicalised and rebuilt.”
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told PBS this week the PA would not return to Gaza “on the back of an Israeli tank”.

The Reuters news agency is reporting that Israel’s military says an organisation in Syria launched a drone that hit a school in the southern Israeli city of Eilat on Thursday, and that it struck the group in response.
The military did not say what organisation in Syria had launched the drone toward Eilat, on the Red Sea.
But it said in a statement it holds Syria’s government fully responsible “for any terror activity emanating from its territory.” There were no reports of injuries from the drone strike, which caused light damage, according to Reuters.
The drone incident adds to a spate of attacks directed from the region since the 7 October outbreak of Israeli fighting with Gaza’s Hamas militants.
It is now 5am in Gaza and Tel Aviv.
Here is a summary of the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas conflict:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said of his government: “we don’t seek to conquer Gaza, we don’t seek to occupy Gaza, and we don’t seek to govern Gaza”. But he said “a credible force” would be needed to end Hamas rule of the territory. “What we have to see is Gaza demilitarised, deradicalised and rebuilt,” he told Fox News in the US. “We have to destroy Hamas, not only for our sake, but for the sake of everyone.”
Gaza officials said Israel launched air strikes on or near at least three hospitals on Friday, further stressing the Palestinian territory’s precarious health system as it struggles to cope with thousands of people wounded or displaced in Israel’s war against Hamas militants.
At least 10,812 Palestinians, including 4,412 children, have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the health ministry in Gaza has said in its latest update.
18 Palestinians have been killed and at least 20 others injured by the Israel Defence Forces during a raid on Thursday on Jenin city and its refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. According to Palestinian health ministry figures, at least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the 7 October attack on Israel.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said one of their paramedics was shot in the back and wounded by Israeli forces targeting an ambulance during the raid in Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Thursday.
Officials and diplomats are negotiating a days-long ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages, including children, women, elderly and sick people, the Guardian understands. The discussions include the possibility of a one- to three-day ceasefire, although nothing has been agreed, sources with knowledge of the negotiations have said.
The White House announced that Israel would begin to implement four-hour “humanitarian pauses” in parts of northern Gaza to allow people to leave. The US national security spokesperson, John Kirby, described it as “a significant first step”. The US state department later said on Thursday that there will be two humanitarian corridors for civilians to leave hostile areas of northern Gaza.
The Israeli military has said it has not agreed to a ceasefire but that it will continue to allow “tactical, local pauses” to let in humanitarian aid into Gaza. A senior Israeli official told the Times of Israel the new four-hour pauses will take place in a different northern Gaza neighbourhood each day, with residents notified three hours ahead of time. There were no immediate reports of a lull in fighting raging among the ruined buildings in the north of the Gaza Strip on Thursday. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said it was undertaking “localised and pinpoint measures” for civilians to leave but “these things do not detract from the war fighting”.
Any plans for short-term pauses in the fighting in Gaza must be carried out in coordination with the UN and following agreement by all sides to be “truly effective”, a UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric has said.
Thousands of Palestinians continued to flee south from northern Gaza. Israel said it had allowed movement along the Salah al-Din road – the main highway that runs along the Gaza Strip – for the fifth consecutive day. Images of the mass exodus showed many people evacuating on foot with their belongings tied to their backs, with some pushing wheelchairs and prams.
Yemen’s Houthi forces have said they launched “a barrage of ballistic missiles” targeting “various sensitive targets” in southern Israel. A Houthi military spokesperson said some of those missiles were heading for the Red Sea city of Eilat. Israel’s military said a drone hit a building in the southern Israeli city, and that no physical injuries were reported.
The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt reopened on Thursday for limited evacuations. Nearly 700 foreign passport holders and dependents were reportedly able to leave Gaza through the crossing on Thursday as well as 12 medical evacuees and 10 companions, after the crossing was suspended for a day.
AFP on worsening conflict in Jenin, in the occupied West Bank…
Around four tyre fires belching black smoke, Palestinians clashed with Israeli soldiers in Jenin on Thursday in the deadliest army raid the occupied West Bank has seen since 2005.
The Palestinian city, a militant stronghold and the site of frequent army raids, was rocked by dozens of explosions as Israeli armoured vehicles tore through the streets, fighting running battles with Palestinian gunmen using assault rifles and pipe bombs.
AFP reporters saw one masked militant lying bloody on the pavement, as another took his rifle to fire towards Israeli positions.
Another three were seen to be wounded, while AFP counted five bodies in a nearby hospital morgue, where weeping relatives kept vigil over the deceased.
The Palestinian health ministry said 14 were killed in the raid, with the violence continuing until Thursday evening, making it the deadliest single incursion in the West Bank since 2005, according to United Nations records.
Four more were killed elsewhere in the West Bank on Thursday, the health ministry said, putting the toll of Palestinians killed in the West Bank by Israeli fire on in settler attacks since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7 at more than 180 people. Three Israelis were killed in violence in the West Bank over that period, according to officials.
“This is every day,” said a 39-year-old Palestinian computer engineer, who asked to remain anonymous.
“This is our life,” he said before fresh gunfire sent panic through a crowd of onlookers who ran down the street.

The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas gunmen stormed into Israel in an unprecedented attack that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and has retaliated with an aerial bombing and ground offensive that the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip says has killed more than 10,800 people, mostly civilians.
The West Bank - a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war - has also been roiled by violence amid increasing raids targeting militants.
The Israeli military said 20 people were detained in Thursday’s Jenin raid, including two members of the Islamic Jihad militant group.
From a hilltop vantage point, the crackle of gunfire echoed off high-rise buildings, amid smoke and sirens.
Fresh explosions occurred every five minutes at the peak of the fighting mid-afternoon, as an Israeli drone circled over the city.
A local told AFP leaflets were airdropped in the morning over Jenin refugee camp - home to some 23,000 people, according to the UN - warning them to avoid militant factions.
In the afternoon, more pamphlets were scattered from above, as locals said fighting had left children trapped in their schools.
“We feel even more bad than what you would assume,” said a 42-year-old dentist, after gesturing in the direction of Israeli troops and drawing a finger across his throat.
“They say in Gaza the problem is Hamas. The problem is not Hamas, the problem is the occupation.”
On the streets, Israeli troops faced off with militants hiding behind cover.
Dozens of spectators milled in side streets, surging forward to help the wounded and direct ambulances.
Two men in balaclavas stalked through the crowd, one carrying a gun with the emblem of Palestinian militants Islamic Jihad.
The Iran-backed group, which is also active in Gaza, is blacklisted as a “terrorist organisation” by the European Union and the United States.
Nearby, a pickup truck waited to carry away the dead and wounded.
“They shoot indiscriminately, in a barbaric way,” said 35-year-old paramedic Muhammad al-Ahmad. “Every hour we have a body.”
At a local morgue, the pale faces of young men were stained with blood. The dead body of 45-year-old Muhammad Aqel’s nephew lay in an adjacent prayer room.
“What keeps us strong is our steadfastness and God. This land is our land,” said Aqel.
International flight bookings around the world have fallen since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict especially in the Americas as people cancel trips to the Middle East and around the world.
Global travel demand has weakened since the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas killed 1,400 people in southern Israel on 7 October, and Israel responded with air and ground strikes on Gaza that Palestinian authorities say have killed over 10,000 people.
“This war is a catastrophic, heartbreaking, human tragedy that we are all seeing daily on our TV screens,” Olivier Ponti, vice president of travel analysis firm ForwardKeys, said in a statement.
“That is bound to put people off (from) traveling to the region, but it has also dented consumer confidence in traveling elsewhere too.”
International flight bookings from the Americas dropped 10% in the three weeks after the 7 October attack, when compared to the number of tickets issued three weeks before the attack, according to flight ticketing data.
Reuters has filed on reports of Israeli air-strikes on or near hospitals in Gaza...
Gaza officials said Israel launched air strikes on or near at least three hospitals on Friday, further stressing the Palestinian territory’s precarious health system as it struggles to cope with thousands of people wounded or displaced in Israel’s war against Hamas militants.
“The Israeli occupation launched simultaneous strikes on a number of hospitals during the past hours”, Gaza ministry of health spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra told Al Jazeera television.
The medical facilities included Gaza’s biggest hospital, Al Shifa, where Israel said Hamas has hidden command centres and tunnels, allegations Hamas denies. Qidra said Israel targeted the Gaza City medical complex’s courtyard and there were casualties, but he did not provide details.
Israel’s military did not immediately comment on Qidra’s statement, which Reuters could not independently verify.
Gaza’s hospitals have struggled to care for victims of Israel’s month-long military campaign, aimed at obliterating Palestinian militant group Hamas, as medical supplies, clean water and fuel to power generators run out.
Gaza’s health ministry has said 18 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals and 40 other health centres were out of service either due to damage from bombardment or lack of fuel.
Palestinian media published video footage on Friday of Al Shifa, which Reuters was not immediately able to authenticate, that it said showed the aftermath of an Israeli attack on a parking lot where displaced Palestinians were sheltered and journalists were observing.
A pool of blood could be seen next to the body of a man being placed on a stretcher.
“With ongoing strikes and fighting nearby (Al Shifa), we are gravely concerned about the well-being of thousands of civilians there, many children among them, seeking medical care and shelter,” Human Rights Watch said on social media site X.
Qidra said Al-Rantisi Pediatric Hospital and Al-Nasr Children’s Hospital “have been witnessing a series of direct attacks and bombardments” on Friday. He said strikes on the hospital grounds at Al-Rantisi set vehicles on fire but they had been partly extinguished.
Isabel Debre reports for Associated Press from Jerusalem
Fistfights break out in bread lines. Residents wait hours for a gallon of brackish water that makes them sick. Scabies, diarrhea and respiratory infections rip through overcrowded shelters. And some families have to choose who eats.
“My kids are crying because they are hungry and tired and can’t use the bathroom,” said Suzan Wahidi, an aid worker and mother of five at a UN shelter in the central town of Deir al-Balah, where hundreds of people share a single toilet. “I have nothing for them.”
With the Israel-Hamas war in its second month and more than 10,000 people killed in Gaza, trapped civilians are struggling to survive without electricity or running water. Palestinians who managed to flee Israel’s ground invasion in northern Gaza now encounter scarcity of food and medicine in the south, and there is no end in sight to the war sparked by Hamas’s deadly 7 October attack.
Over half a million displaced people have crammed into hospitals and UN schools-turned-shelters in the south. The schools — overcrowded, strewn with trash, swarmed by flies — have become a breeding ground for infectious diseases.
Since the start of the war, several hundred trucks of aid have entered Gaza through the southern Rafah crossing, but aid organisations say that’s a drop in the ocean of need. For most people, each day has become a drudging cycle of searching for bread and water and waiting in lines.
The sense of desperation has strained Gaza’s close-knit society, which has endured decades of conflict, four wars with Israel and a 16-year blockade since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces.
Some Palestinians have even vented their anger against Hamas, shouting insults at officials or beating up policemen in scenes unimaginable just a month ago, witnesses say.
“Everywhere you go, you see tension in the eyes of people,” said Yousef Hammash, an aid worker with the Norwegian Refugee Council in the southern town of Khan Younis. “You can tell they are at a breaking point.”
Supermarket shelves are nearly empty. Bakeries have shut down because of lack of flour and fuel for the ovens. Gaza’s farmland is mostly inaccessible, and there’s little in produce markets beyond onions and oranges. Families cook lentils over small fires in the streets.
“You hear children crying in the night for sweets and hot food,” said Ahmad Kanj, 28, a photographer at a shelter in the southern town of Rafah. “I can’t sleep.”
Many people say they’ve gone weeks without meat, eggs or milk and now live on one meal a day.
“There is a real threat of malnutrition and people starving,” said Alia Zaki, spokesperson for the UN’s World Food Program. What aid workers call “food insecurity” is the new baseline for Gaza’s 2.3 million people, she said.
Famed Gazan dishes like jazar ahmar — juicy red carrots stuffed with ground lamb and rice — are a distant memory, replaced by dates and packaged biscuits. Even those are hard to find.
Each day families send their most assertive relative off before dawn to one of the few bakeries still functioning. Some take knives and sticks — they say they must prepare to defend themselves if attacked, with riots sporadically breaking out in bread and water lines.
“I send my sons to the bakeries and eight hours later, they’ve come back with bruises and sometimes not even bread,” said 59-year-old Etaf Jamala, who fled Gaza City for the southern town of Deir al-Balah, where she sleeps in the packed halls of a hospital with 15 family members.
One woman told The Associated Press that her nephew, a 27-year-old father of five in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya in northern Gaza, was stabbed in the back with a kitchen knife after being accused of cutting the line for water. He needed dozens of stitches, she said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.
The violence has jarred the tiny territory, where family names are linked to community status and even small indiscretions can be magnified in the public eye.
“The social fabric for which Gaza was known is fraying due to the anxiety and uncertainty and loss,” said Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
Israel cut off water to Gaza shortly after the Hamas attack, saying its complete siege would be lifted only after the militants released the roughly 240 hostages they captured. Israel has since turned on pipelines to the center and south, but there’s no fuel to pump or process the water. The taps run dry.
Those who can’t find or afford bottled water rely on salty, unfiltered well water, which doctors say causes diarrhea and serious gastrointestinal infections.
“I cannot recognise my own son,” said Fadi Ihjazi. The three-year-old has lost five kilograms (11 pounds) in just two weeks, she said, and has been diagnosed with a chronic intestinal infection.
“Before the war he had the sweetest baby face,” Ihjazi said, but now his lips are chapped, his face yellowish, his eyes sunken.
Sadeia Abu Harbeid, 44, said she missed a chemotherapy treatment for her breast cancer during the second week of the war and can’t find painkillers. Without regular treatments, she says, her chances of survival are slim.
She hardly eats, choosing to give most of the little food she has to her two-year-old. “This existence is a humiliation,” she said.
Across Gaza, rare scenes of dissent are playing out. Some Palestinians are openly challenging the authority of Hamas, which long has ruled the enclave with an iron fist. Four Palestinians across Gaza spoke to AP on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals about what they’ve seen.
A man who was told off by a Hamas officer for cutting the bread line took a chair and smashed it over his head, according to an aid worker in line. In another area, angry crowds hurled stones at Hamas police who cut in front of a water line and beat them with their fists until they scattered, according to a journalist there.
Over the past few night in Gaza City, Hamas rockets streaming overhead toward Israel have prompted outbursts of rage from a UN shelter. In the middle of the night, hundreds of people have shouted insults against Hamas and cried out that they wanted the war to end, according to a 28-year-old sleeping in a tent there with his family.
And during a televised press conference Tuesday, a young man with a dazed expression and bandaged wrist pushed his way through the crowd, disrupting a speech by Iyad Bozum, spokesman for the Hamas-run Interior Ministry.
“May God hold you to account, Hamas!” the man yelled, shaking his wounded hand.
Gaza’s future remains uncertain as Israeli tanks rumble down the ghostly streets of Gaza City with the goal of toppling Hamas. Palestinians say it will never be the same.
“The Gaza I know is just a memory now,” said 16-year-old Jehad Ghandour, who fled to Rafah. “There are no places or anything I know left.”
And the Israeli prime minister reiterated his government had not agreed to a cease fire.
Well, one thing we haven’t agreed to is a cease fire. A cease fire with Hamas means surrender to Hamas, surrender to terror and the victory of Iran’s axis of terror. So there won’t be a cease fire without the release of Israeli hostages
The fighting continues against the Hamas enemy, the Hamas terrorists, but in specific locations for a given period, a few hours here, a few hours there, we want to facilitate a safe passage of civilians away from the zone of fighting. And we’re doing that.
More from that interview with Netanyahu on Fox News in the US. He said Hamas must be “gone” from Gaza.
I think It’s clear what Gaza’s future has to look like. Hamas will be gone, we have to destroy Hamas, not only for our sake, but for the sake of everyone. For the sake of civilization, for the sake of Palestians and Israelis alike.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday his country does not seek to conquer, occupy or govern Gaza after its war against Hamas but a “credible force” would be needed to enter the Palestinian territory if necessary to prevent the emergence of militant threats.
Netanyahu’s comments this week suggesting that Israel would be responsible for Gaza security indefinitely drew pushback from the United States, Israel’s main ally.

“So, we have to have credible force that, if necessary, will enter Gaza and kill the killers. Because that’s what will prevent the reemergence of a Hamas-like entity,” Netanyahu said.
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 10,800 Palestinians, according to health officials there. A humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded as basic supplies run out and wounded people overwhelm a fragile medical system.
US officials say the Palestinian Authority (PA), which has limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, should return to govern Gaza after the war. Hamas seized control of Gaza from the PA forces of President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007.
Top Palestinian officials, including Abbas, say a PA return to Gaza must be accompanied by a political solution that ends Israel’s occupation of territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Netanyahu said that after the war, “what we have to see is Gaza demilitarised, deradicalised and rebuilt.”
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told PBS this week the PA would not return to Gaza “on the back of an Israeli tank”.
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has posted an update on ‘Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel’.
The OCHA said on Thursday, more than 50,000 people fled from areas north of Wadi Gaza (the north of Gaza) southwards, through a ‘corridor’ opened by the Israeli military.
But hundreds of thousands of people still in the north “are struggling to secure the minimum amounts of water and food to survive”.
The OCHA also said:
The Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, stressed that “the UN cannot be part of a unilateral proposal to push hundreds of thousands of desperate civilians in Gaza into so-called safe zones.”
All municipal water wells shut down again due to the lack of fuel, halting the supply of water for domestic non-drinking uses.
UNRWA opened two additional shelters and is now hosting 582,000 IDPs in 92 facilities south of Wadi Gaza in increasingly overcrowded conditions: on average, every toilet is shared by 160 people, and every shower unit by 700 people.
Al-Nasr Children’s Hospital in Gaza city was hit during an airstrike, reportedly killing three people and injuring dozens more. The vicinity of Shifa hospital was also reportedly hit and Gaza’s only psychiatric hospital stopped functioning.
With only 65 trucks entering from Egypt on 9 November, the volume of aid entering from Egypt is “wholly inadequate,” Griffiths said, stressing that hundreds of trucks are needed every day, including fuel, and that more than one entry point should be opened.
In the West Bank, 18 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in less than 24 hours, since the afternoon of 8 November, bringing the Palestinian fatality toll since 7 October to 175, including 46 children.

Médecins Sans Frontières has insisted “hospitals are not targets and must remain safe spaces”, saying there had been a “surge in violence” in the West Bank.
Since 7 October we have seen a dramatic increase in violence from Israeli forces in Jenin. Since then, our team has treated over 30 patients with gunshot and blast wounds.
Today, there has been a surge in violence, with widespread bombing and shooting – this morning leaflets were dropped on Jenin refugee camp, telling residents to evacuate, many of whom have no safe place to go.
This morning around 10:30am our team treated a paramedic who was shot while inside an ambulance. Since 11am this morning, Israeli military vehicles have blocked ambulances from entering the hospitals, forcing them to refer patients to hospitals further away.
Last night, a soldier fired at the emergency unit of the hospital, hitting the wall in full view of our colleagues who were standing outside. Today, our team witnessed Israeli forces fire at the entrance of the hospital, with bullets hitting the wall directly above the door.
Hospitals are not targets and must remain safe spaces. Medical care must not be impeded.
On the main street of the Palestinian West Bank town of Huwara, where Road 60 heads north towards Nablus, the shops are all shuttered.
Petrol stations, bakeries, banks, the business selling cut stone from the local quarries, the sweetshops and mobile phone boutiques are closed at the order of the Israeli military. At the main crossing points between the west and east of the now divided town, wary Israeli soldiers with machine guns guard a closed yellow metal gate.
On the road itself, the only cars that are moving belong to residents of the nearby hardline Jewish settlements that dot the surrounding hills, whose ultra-orthodox nationalist residents have a reputation for promoting and carrying out violence against Palestinians.
The denial of Road 60 to Huwara’s Palestinian residents is being enforced despite the fact that a new bypass for the use of the settlers is now passable by car: but many choose to drive through the centre of Huwara, to emphasise their hold on the land.

WHO says a child is killed every 10 minutes in Gaza – as it happened,2023-11-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/10/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-fighting-pauses-un-palestine,"Head of World Health Organisation says Gaza’s health system is ‘on its knees’. This blog is now closed
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has described the situation on the ground in Gaza, from hospitals conducting operations without anaesthetics to the fact that a child is killed every 10 minutes.
“Nowhere and no one is safe,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the UN security council on Friday.
Gaza’s health system “is on its knees”, he said. He said there have been more than 250 attacks on health centres in Gaza and 25 in Israel since the start of the conflict last month. More than 100 UN colleagues have been killed.
Half of the 36 hospitals in Gaza and two-thirds of its primary healthcare centers were not functioning, he said. Those that were operating were way beyond their capacities, he said.
This is where we’ll pause our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war for now – we’ll resume it later in the day. Here’s a rundown on the latest as it just passes 5.45am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv.
France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said there is “no justification” for the Israeli bombing of babies, women and elderly people in Gaza. Macron, speaking to the BBC a day after a humanitarian aid conference in Paris about the war, called for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying it would benefit Israel. In response, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Hamas was responsible for the civilian deaths in Gaza.
The largest hospital in Gaza, where up to 50,000 people are sheltering, is facing bombardment, the World Health Organisation has said. Palestinian officials said Israel launched airstrikes on or near four hospitals and a school on Friday, killing at least 22 people. A WHO spokesperson said 20 hospitals in Gaza were out of action and that there was “intense violence” at al-Shifa hospital in the heart of Gaza City. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Israeli forces opened fire on the intensive care unit at al-Quds hospital in Gaza City.
An Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson has said the Israeli army is aware of the sensitivities of the hospitals in Gaza. “The IDF does not fire on hostages but if we see a Hamas terrorist we will kill him,” Lt Col Richard Hecht said in a press briefing on Friday.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has urgently called for the protection of patients, healthcare workers and medical facilities in Gaza. An ICRC statement warned that Gaza’s healthcare system had “reached a point of no return” amid escalating violence that had “severely” affected hospitals and ambulances working in the besieged territory.
The number of people killed in Gaza by Israeli military actions since the start of the war on 7 October has risen to 11,078, including 4,506 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry on Friday. Another 27,490 Palestinians in Gaza had been wounded, it said.
Israel has revised downwards the death toll from last month’s Hamas attacks in the south of the country from 1,400 to about 1,200, a foreign ministry spokesperson said. The revision was “due to the fact that there were lot of corpses that were not identified and now we think those belong to terrorists … not Israeli casualties”, they said on Friday.
Thousands of Palestinians continued to flee south from northern Gaza on Friday a day after the White House announced that Israel would begin to implement four-hour “humanitarian pauses” in parts of the area to allow people to leave. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Friday that more than 100,000 residents had fled south from Gaza City during the past two days.
Despite the US announcement, there have been no immediate reports of a lull in fighting in northern Gaza. The Israeli military has said there would be “tactical, local pauses for humanitarian aid for Gazan civilians” but “no ceasefire”. On the ground, conditions continued to deteriorate as night fell over Gaza City on Friday during a sustained Israeli onslaught with heavy gunfire, explosions and the buzz of Israeli military drones heard.
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said a child was killed every 10 minutes in Gaza. “Nowhere and no one is safe,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the UN security council on Friday, adding that Gaza’s health system was “on its knees”, with half of its 36 hospitals not functioning.
The UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, has called for an investigation into what he described as Israel’s “indiscriminate” bombardment and shelling in densely populated areas in the Gaza Strip. “The extensive Israeli bombardment of Gaza, including the use of high-impact explosive weapons in densely populated areas ... is clearly having a devastating humanitarian and human rights impact,” Türk told reporters in Jordan.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said “far too many Palestinians had been killed” in the war. He said that while the US “appreciates” Israel’s steps to minimise civilian casualties, it was not enough. Blinken said the US had proposed additional ideas to the Israelis, including longer “humanitarian pauses” and expanding the amount of assistance getting into Gaza.
Israel’s embassy to the US has issued a rare public rebuke to a State Department office that deals with Palestinian affairs, after it criticised Israel’s demolition of a Palestinian home in Jerusalem. The US Office of Palestinian Affairs posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday that the demolition was “in response to the actions of their 13-year-old child” and that “an entire family should not lose their home because of the actions of one individual”. The Israeli embassy shot back in response: “Context is helpful: the ‘13-year-old’ is a terrorist who murdered an Israeli citizen by stabbing him to death.”
Each recorded fatal Israeli airstrike on Gaza since 7 October has caused an average of 10.1 civilian deaths, a monitoring group has said, amid warnings that reported civilian casualty figures are likely to be an underestimate. The fatality average is far higher than in the three previous Israeli air campaigns in Gaza.
Crowds of people marched through the centre of Jenin in the occupied West Bank for the funerals of Palestinians killed during an IDF raid. As the Israeli offensive in Gaza continues, violence in the occupied West Bank is escalating. Nineteen Palestinians were killed across the territory on Thursday as clashes took place with Israeli forces.
Israel has killed a further seven Hezbollah fighters on its northern border with Lebanon, taking the total death toll of Hezbollah fighters to 78 since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October. The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, will make his second speech this month on Saturday, setting out his latest thinking.
Israel is considering a deal for Hamas to release all civilian hostages held in Gaza, according to a report. Under one of the proposals being discussed, Hamas would release 10 to 20 civilian hostages in exchange for a brief pause in fighting, one official said. That could be followed by a release of about 100 civilians if terms were met.
Evacuations from the Gaza Strip in to Egypt for foreign passport holders and for injured Palestinians requiring urgent medical treatment were suspended on Friday. The suspension was due to problems bringing medical evacuees to the Rafah crossing from inside Gaza, Reuters reported. The Rafah crossing was also suspended on Wednesday due to what the US state department referred to as unspecified “security circumstance”.
Saudi Arabia will host an extraordinary joint Islamic-Arab summit in Riyadh on Saturday, the Saudi foreign ministry said. The kingdom had been scheduled to host two extraordinary summits, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit and the Arab League summit, on Saturday. The joint summit would replace the two separate gatherings, the ministry said, due to “the exceptional circumstances taking place in the Palestinian Gaza Strip”.
British healthcare workers in uniform protested outside Downing Street on Friday to commemorate almost 200 clinicians killed in Gaza since Israel’s bombardment began. The vigil was organised to call on the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to push for an urgent ceasefire.
The organisers of the pro-Palestine march due to take place in London on Armistice Day believe “hundreds of thousands” of people will turn out for what they say will be one of Britain’s biggest days of mass protest.
The AP report continues:
More than 720,000 displaced people across the Gaza Strip were sheltering at 150 facilities run by UNRWA, as of Thursday.
At shelters, the lack of water makes it hard to maintain even basic hygiene.
Families are packed into a school building in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, with tents set up in the playground, washing hung up to dry in corridors and children sleeping on mats next to their worried parents.
Suzan Wahidi, from Gaza City, says as many as seven people might share a mattress – if they can find one.
Our children are now suffering from an epidemic. They suffer from all the diseases that you can imagine, diarrhea, vomiting, fever. There are no medicines, there is no food to provide us.
The Associated Press has this report on the death and misery Palestinians are describing as they flee south from the intense fighting in northern Gaza.
A stream of thousands of Palestinians have taken what few belongings they can carry and made their way on foot Friday to the relative safety of the southern Gaza Strip after Israel announced an hours-long window for safe passage.
One woman who was displaced from Beit Lahiya in the north, Umm al-Adhan, spoke to AP on Gaza’s main highway as people trudged past heading southward. She said she had been sheltering in a school run by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
She said:
Yesterday, as we were leaving the school, they fired at us. Ten people were killed, including my nephew.
A badly wounded child begged for water in his final moments.
The woman added, crying:
I could not find water to give him. He died in front of me.
Israel estimates that more than 850,000 of the 1.1 million people in northern Gaza have left, and later on Friday said over 100,000 Palestinians had gone south in the past two days.
Islamophobia and antisemitism have seen sharp increases across the US after the Israel-Hamas war erupted last month.
According to a new report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), the Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation received a total of 1,283 requests for help and reports of bias between 7 October and 4 November. The spike was “unprecedented”, it said.
Jewish communities, meanwhile, say they have also faced record-high levels of antisemitism.
On 25 October, the Anti-Defamation League reported an increase of nearly 400% in antisemitic incidents reported year-on-year. From 7 to 23 October, it recorded a total of 312 antisemitic incidents, 190 of which were directly linked to the violence in Israel and Gaza.

Almost 2,000 police will be on duty on Saturday when more than 100,000 pro-Palestinian supporters are expected to march through London, with extra powers in place to protect landmarks honouring Britain’s war dead, Agence France-Presse reports.
Pro-Palestinian marches have been held in the UK capital over recent weekends, with police making almost 100 arrests for offences including supporting banned organisations and serious hate crimes.
But Saturday’s march promises to be more fraught as it coincides with Armistice Day, which commemorates those who have died in conflict since world war one.
The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, made a late plea for peaceful demonstrations, saying in a statement released late on Friday:
It is because of those who fought for this country and for the freedom we cherish that those who wish to protest can do so, but they must do so respectfully and peacefully.
It would be a “particularly challenging and tense weekend”, Laurence Taylor, the Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner leading Saturday’s operation, said on Friday.
We have a full report on the demonstration here:
A doctor at the largest hospital in Gaza has described heavy bombing outside the facility going late into the night.
“Every time, every minute, we hear bombing around us,” orthopedic surgeon Dr Adnan Albursh of the al-Shifa hospital told the US NBC News network around midnight local time.
He said there were also multiple bombardments around al-Shifa throughout the day. Many people fled from the hospital but thousands were still there, he said.
We cannot evacuate the hospital because there are a lot of patients here. There’s children, women, all ages.
As we reported earlier, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said al-Shifa – in the heart of Gaza City – is facing a bombardment. Up to 50,000 people are sheltering there.
Palestinian officials said Israel launched airstrikes on or near four hospitals and a school on Friday, killing at least 22 people. A WHO spokesperson said 20 hospitals in Gaza were out of action and there was “intense violence” at al-Shifa hospital.
Saudi Arabia will host a joint Islamic-Arab summit in Riyadh on Saturday, the Saudi foreign ministry has said.
The joint meeting “will be held in response to the exceptional circumstances taking place in the Palestinian Gaza Strip as countries feel the need to unify efforts and come out with a unified collective position”, Reuters reported the ministry as saying.
The kingdom was scheduled to host two extraordinary summits, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit and the Arab League summit, on Saturday. The joint summit would replace the two separate gatherings, the ministry said.
The decision was taken after Saudi Arabia onsulted with the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, according to the statement.
Israeli forces have carried out airstrikes on a series of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, the Israel Defence Forces has said.
IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said on X (formerly Twitter):
Among the targets attacked were a number of buildings and military positions where the organization’s terrorists operated, a weapons warehouse and an intelligence infrastructure from which terrorists directed terrorism against the State of Israel.
Hagari said the Israeli strikes were in response to launches from the Hezbollah militant group over the past day.

As the Guardian’s Patrick Wintour reported earlier, Israel has killed a further seven Hezbollah fighters on its northern border with Lebanon, taking the total death toll of Hezbollah fighters to 78 since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October.
Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is to make his second speech this month on Saturday setting out his latest thinking. He ended his last speech on 3 November by saying he was leaving all military options on the table.
Israel’s embassy to the United States has issued a rare public rebuke to a State Department office that deals with Palestinian affairs, after it criticised Israel’s demolition of a Palestinian home in Jerusalem, Agence France-Presse is reporting.
“The government of Israel has demolished the home of a Palestinian family in response to the actions of their 13-year-old child,” the US Office of Palestinian Affairs posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday.
It added:
An entire family should not lose their home because of the actions of one individual.
The Israeli embassy shot back in response:
Context is helpful: the ‘13-year-old’ is a terrorist who murdered an Israeli citizen by stabbing him to death.
Neither side named the teenager, but Israeli media identified him as Muhammad Zalbani, who it said had stabbed to death an Israeli border policeman as he was inspecting a bus in East Jerusalem in February.
The Times of Israel said the home demolition took place on Wednesday in the Shuafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem, under the protection of a large police force.
Israel has defended its controversial policy of destroying the homes of Palestinians who carry out attacks on its citizens, a practice widely condemned by human rights groups as collective punishment.
The latest demolition took place amid open warfare between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

It’s 2am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
The number of people killed in Gaza by Israeli military actions since the start of the war on 7 October has risen to 11,078, including 4,506 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry on Friday. Another 27,490 Palestinians in Gaza have been wounded, it said.

Columbia University has suspended two student organisations that have led protests calling for a ceasefire in Israel’s military offensive against Hamas.
The New York university said in a statement on Friday that it has suspended Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace as official student organisations for the rest of the fall semester.
The statement reads:
This decision was made after the two groups repeatedly violated university policies related to holding campus events, culminating in an unauthorized event Thursday afternoon that proceeded despite warnings and included threatening rhetoric and intimidation.
On Thursday, hundreds of Columbia University students walked out of their classes to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is preparing to fight in Gaza for a year, according to a report.
Israel’s military is set to expand its ground operations into areas of the Gaza Strip where the IDF has never operated before, the Times of Israel said that Channel 12 reported.
The report said the IDF is “preparing for a period of a year of fighting … in different areas … different methods, but a year of fighting to get to the fourth stage of this war: the entry of a new government in Gaza that is not Hamas and is not backed by the Iranians.”
There is “no pressure to hurry”, the report said.
That is the message army commanders are being told all the time: work slowly and securely. Bring the results.
Benjamin Netanyahu has responded to French president Emmanuel Macron’s call for Israel to stop bombing babies, women and elderly people in Gaza.
Macron, in an interview with the BBC on Friday, said there is “no justification” for the ongoing bombing of civilians in Gaza.
In a statement from his office, the Israeli prime minister said:
While Israel is doing everything to refrain from harming civilians and calling on them to leave areas of fighting, Hamas-Isis is doing everything to prevent them from leaving for safe areas and is using them as human shields.
Hamas is “cruelly holding our hostages – women, children and the elderly – in a crime against humanity” and “uses schools, mosques and hospitals as terror command centres”, he said.
Joe Biden spoke with the sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, today.
The two leaders discussed the situation in Gaza, as well as “the importance of sustained humanitarian access and the importance of protecting civilians, consistent with international humanitarian law”, according to a readout by the White House.
The statement went on to say:
They emphasized the importance of deterring threats from any state or non-state actor seeking to expand the conflict and of working towards a durable and sustained peace in the Middle East, to include the establishment of a Palestinian state.

Israel kills seven more Hezbollah fighters on border with Lebanon,2023-11-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/israel-kills-more-hezbollah-fighters-border-lebanon,"Iranian foreign minister says wider regional conflict inevitable as death toll among militant group rises to 78
Israel has killed a further seven Hezbollah fighters on its northern border with Lebanon, taking the total death toll of Hezbollah fighters to 78 since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October.
The rising death toll in Lebanon and the killing of 18 Palestinians by Israeli security forces in the West Bank on Thursday prompted the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, to declare that a wider regional escalation of the conflict was inevitable.
Hezbollah, the Lebanese political and militant group and Iran’s most prominent proxy movement, named the seven fighters in a statement that said they were “martyred on the road to Jerusalem”, the phrase Hezbollah often uses to record deaths. The high Hezbollah death toll has prompted internal debates about its next steps.
The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, will make his second speech this month on Saturday, setting out his latest thinking. He ended his last one-hour speech on 3 November by saying he was leaving all military options on the table and that this dispute with Israel was of a different order to all its predecessors.
Iran’s alarming forecast about the trajectory of events will be tested when Saudi Arabia convenes an extraordinary joint Islamic-Arab summit in Riyadh on Saturday.
The kingdom had been scheduled to host two extraordinary summits, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit and the Arab League summit, this weekend.
But late on Friday, Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry said the two would be combined “in response to the exceptional circumstances taking place in the Palestinian Gaza Strip as countries feel the need to unify efforts and come out with a unified collective position”.
Iran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi, is due to attend and the OIC is expected to demand concrete steps to contain Israel.
In a serious test for Saudi diplomacy the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, will have to walk a fine line between being seen merely to repeat previously unheeded appeals to Israel to show constraint, or instead to start to take practical steps such as an oil boycott of Israel. Prince Mohammed has previously been extremely reluctant to consider a boycott, which has been the lead demand of Iran.
Raisi said in advance of the meeting: “My assessment is that if the emergency meeting of the [OIC] in Saudi Arabia does not lead to helping and saving the Palestinian nation, the scope of conflicts in the region will increase. The region will realise that Islamic governments are unable to help the people of Palestine and Gaza.”
He has been pressing Arab governments to break their ties with Israel. Speaking on Friday, Prince Mohammed limited himself to condemning violations of international law by Israel in Gaza.
However, Saudi Arabia regards a conditional offer of normalisation dependent on Israeli concessions over a Palestinian state as some of the best leverage the Gulf countries possess over Israel.
In the run-up to the summit, the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamid al-Thani, met the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in Cairo to discuss “intensive efforts” to achieve a ceasefire and protect civilians in the Gaza Strip.
On Wednesday, the US special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, David Satterfield, dismissed the idea that Iran and its proxies were planning to join the war in any meaningful way. “We do not believe that a conflict involving Lebanon and Israel is in any way inevitable,” Satterfield said. “The here and now reality is there is no indication on any side that there is an intent to precipitate a conflict or a war.”
But that estimate is not universally shared. On Thursday, Yemeni rebels claimed responsibility for firing a “salvo of ballistic missiles” towards the city of Eilat, in southern Israel, 2,000km (1,240 miles) from their capital, Sana’a. The Israeli army confirmed it intercepted projectiles using the Arrow missile defence system and Patriot anti-aircraft batteries. The day before, the Houthis shot down a US army MQ-9 drone off the coast of Yemen.
 This article was amended on 13 November 2023 to remove an incorrect statement that the death toll of Hezbollah fighters is higher than that in the 2006 war with Israel.

Israel-Hamas fake news thrives on poorly regulated online platforms,2023-11-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/11/israel-hamas-fake-news-thrives-on-poorly-regulated-online-platforms,"Claims on X and Telegram include downplaying 7 October Hamas attack and allegations Palestinians are faking scenes of suffering
Disinformation has flourished across a range of online platforms in the month since Hamas launched its bloody attack on Israel, fuelled by weak content regulation on X, formerly Twitter, and Telegram and at times propelled by state actors.
Widely shared faked news and false claims include efforts to downplay the horror of Hamas’s cross-border attack on 7 October through to distasteful allegations that Palestinians, already under heavy bombardment, are faking scenes of violence.
Jackson Hinkle, 22, an American far-right social media influencer with 2 million followers on X, formerly Twitter, who has styled himself as a “Maga communist”, claimed, without evidence, at the end of October that Hamas fighters shot fewer than 100 people, mostly armed settlers.
The death toll is estimated at more than 1,200 people, and they were killed inside Israel’s borders so could not have been settlers. But this was only one of Hinkle’s untruths: in the same 28 October posting he said that half of the Israelis killed during the Hamas assault were soldiers, many of whom died “during tank shelling”.
Hinkle, once a young supporter of the leftwing Democrat Bernie Sanders, said he had been banned from YouTube for allegedly spreading misinformation, and also from Instagram for 24 hours, but thrives on X where his 7 October denial post has 5.1m views. The influencer cited the Israeli newspaper Haaretz as his source, although below the post sits a denial from the title.
The newspaper, in a message with 2.5m views, half of the original tweet, said: “The post seen in this photo contains blatant lies about the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7. It has absolutely no basis in Haaretz’s reporting, then or since.”
Hinkle’s recent tweets include a photograph of him with a poster saying “Putin is good” and accusing the BBC of espousing “Zionist propaganda”. His agenda is stridently anti-Israel.
Other postings are transparently false: a claim he made on Telegram that “Yemen has announced they are now at war with Israel” was clearly untrue (the Houthi rebels who have fired missiles at Israel are not the government of the country).
This has not prevented Hinkle from appearing on the Russian-owned RT television news network as a “political analyst”, giving an interview in which he accused Israel of trying to force out the entire Palestinian population from Gaza, and hinted that US marines might be about to participate in a “a very big war”.
Pippa Allen-Kinross, the news editor with the factchecking website Full Fact, said that after more than a month of continuous conflict in Israel and Gaza, disinformation narratives were evolving and highlighted the growing visibility of “Pallywood” postings, claims that Palestinians were faking videos of suffering and distress.
Early in the conflict, on 13 October, the Israeli state’s official account on X tweeted a video of a child being taken to hospital alongside another image of the lifeless infant wrapped in a cloth. “Hamas accidentally posted a video of a doll (yes a doll) suggesting that it was a part of casualties caused by an IDF attack,” the now-deleted post, which was viewed at least 1.2m times, said.
The post was prompted by similar claims made by Israeli activists online, and other official accounts. Israeli embassies in France and Austria quickly followed suit, with the latter describing it as “Pallywood fake news” and the posting was widely shared. But the story, when checked, turned out to be untrue: the original film and the still image were of a four-year-old boy, Omar Bilal al-Banna, killed in Gaza City.
Journalists contacted the photographer and film-maker Momen El Halabi, who reported that a child had been killed – and that the body was not a doll – a story also confirmed by family members. Other images from El Halabi and another photographer on the scene show two men, relatives of the dead boy, carefully holding the swaddled body in such a way it could not be a doll.
A video, now-deleted from Facebook but still available on X, shows a row of bodies covered in white shrouds, and mocks them for still twitching, meaning they are not dead. Arabic text on the Facebook video accuses Hamas of being “the masters of fake news”, but in truth, as Full Fact points out, the film “is actually from a 2013 student protest in Cairo, Egypt”.
Adam Hadley, the founder of Tech against Terrorism, argued the situation was exacerbated – and likely to endure – because of the intensity of the conflict. “This is as much an information war, as it is a war on the ground, but perhaps more pronounced than a conflict like Ukraine, because of the polarisation we are witnessing,” he said.
Others, such as Eliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative journalism website Bellingcat, blamed cutbacks in content moderation at X and the introduction of the paid-for blue-tick system, which allows posters to get preferential treatment from the social network’s algorithm. “I certainly think the changes Elon Musk [X’s owner] has made have made the environment ripe for the spread of disinformation,” Higgins said.
Hadley also focuses on Telegram, from where many graphic Hamas and pro-Hamas videos emerge, which is generally lightly self-regulated. Last month, Pavel Durov, Telegram’s CEO, said he would not ban Hamas’s own channel, but then partially retreated. From the beginning of this month, users who download Telegram via Apple or Google are no longer able to see Hamas or its military wing’s channel.
Higgins said he believed state actors were having only a limited impact, arguing instead that the online environment encouraged cynical behaviour. “The situation is being driven largely by individuals and grifters with their own agendas, partly because anybody on X can now have a verified account. So much of the time people are making no real attempt to find the truth; they just want to make points to bash other people over the head with.”
 This article was amended on 13 December 2023 to clarify that Jackson Hinkle was only banned from Instagram for 24 hours, according to his own social media posts.

Israel-Hamas war: UN calls Gaza fighting ‘reprehensible’ – as it happened,2023-11-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/11/israel-hamas-war-live-staff-report-catastrophic-situation-in-main-gaza-hospital-aid-agency-says-as-fighting-intensifies,"This blog has now closed.

Médecins Sans Frontières has warned that patients and medical staff in Gaza are “trapped in hospitals under fire” and called on the “Israeli government to cease this unrelenting assault on Gaza’s health system”.
In a statement released on Saturday, the humanitarian organization said:
Over the past 24 hours, hospitals in Gaza have been under relentless bombardment. Al-Shifa hospital complex, the biggest health facility where MSF staff are still working, has been hit several times, including the maternity and outpatient departments, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries.
The hostilities around the hospital have not stopped. MSF teams and hundreds of patients are still inside Al-Shifa hospital. MSF urgently reiterates its calls to stop the attacks against hospitals, for an immediate ceasefire and for the protection of medical facilities, medical staff and patients.
Dr. Mohammed Obeid, an MSF surgeon at Dar al-Shifa hospital, said:
There are a lot of patients already operated on and they cannot walk. They cannot evacuate … We need an ambulance to move them, we don’t have ambulances to evacuate all of these patients.
We cannot leave because from [yesterday] morning until now, we operated on about 25 patients. If I am not here or the other surgeon, who will take care of the patients? There is a patient who needs surgery, another one is already sleeping [under anesthesia].
MSF also said that it has lost contact with a surgeon working and sheltering at al-Quds hospital with his family.
It’s approaching 5am in Tel Aviv and we’re pausing our blog here. You can read all our coverage of the Israel-Hamas war here and in the meantime here’s a summary of the key developments:
Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza appeared to be reaching a key moment, with close-quarter battles raging around the most important hospital in the heart of its biggest city. Residents said Israeli forces had been fighting Hamas gunmen all night and throughout Saturday in the neighbourhood in Gaza City where the al-Shifa hospital is located, considered a key strategic area.
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back against growing international calls for a ceasefire, saying Israel’s battle to crush Gaza’s ruling Hamas militants would continue with “full force”. A ceasefire would be possible only if all 239 hostages held by militants in Gaza are released, Netanyahu said in a televised address.
The UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator has released a statement saying: “Hospitals must be places of greater safety, not of war.” In a tweet on Saturday, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said: “There can be no justification for acts of war in healthcare facilities, leaving them with no power, food or water, and shooting at patients and civilians trying to flee.”
Médecins Sans Frontières has warned that patients and medical staff in Gaza are “trapped in hospitals under fire” and called on the “Israeli government to cease this unrelenting assault on Gaza’s health system”. In a statement released on Saturday, the humanitarian organization said: “MSF urgently reiterates its calls to stop the attacks against hospitals, for an immediate ceasefire and for the protection of medical facilities, medical staff and patients.”
The Israeli military will help evacuate babies trapped in Gaza’s Dar al-Shifa hospital on Sunday, the chief Israeli military spokesperson rear admiral Daniel Hagari said on Saturday. “The staff of the Shifa hospital has requested that tomorrow we help the babies in the pediatric department to get to a safer hospital. We will provide the assistance needed,” Hagari told a news conference.
Two premature babies have died due to power cuts at al-Shifa hospital, Physicians for Human Rights Israel said on Saturday. “As a result of the lack of electricity, we can report that the neonatal intensive care unit has stopped working. Two premature infants have died, and there is a real risk to the lives of 37 other premature infants” at Al-Shifa hospital, the group said, citing doctors at the hospital, Agence France-Presse reports.
Netanyahu announced the deaths of five more Israeli soldiers in Gaza. The Israeli military said 46 had been killed since its ground operations there began.
Israel’s three major TV news channels, without citing named sources, said there was some progress toward a deal to free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu said he would not discuss details of any possible deal, which according to N12 News would involve 50 to 100 women, children and elderly being released in stages during a three to five day pause in fighting.
The head of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah party said its armed wing had used new types of weapons and struck new targets in Israel, and pledged that the front against its sworn enemy would remain active. In a televised address, only his second speech since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began in October, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah had shown “a quantitative improvement in the number of operations, the size and the number of targets, as well as an increase in the type of weapons”.
Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant warned Hezbollah not to escalate fighting along the border. “Hezbollah is dragging Lebanon into a war that might happen,” Gallant told troops in a video aired by Israeli television channels.
Arab and Muslim leaders condemned Israeli forces’ “barbaric” actions in Gaza but declined to approve punitive economic and political steps against the country at an extraordinary summit of Arab-Islamic leaders in Saudi Arabia, highlighting regional divisions. The final declaration on Saturday rejected Israeli claims that it is acting in “self-defence” and demanded that the UN security council adopt “a decisive and binding resolution” to halt Israel’s “aggression”.
Iran’s president Ebrahim Raisi has called on Islamic governments to designate Israel’s military a “terrorist organisation”, citing its current operations in the Gaza Strip. “Islamic governments should designate the army of the occupying and aggressor regime as a terrorist organisation,” Raisi told the summit in Saudi Arabia.
Anti-war protesters gathered in Tel Aviv late Saturday to call for a ceasefire and the release of hostages by Hamas. Many demonstrators carried signs reading, “Israelis for ceasefire,” “War has no winners” and “Only peace talks with solve this”.
Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general of the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), has urged the joint Arab-Islamic summit to “act now to change the trajectory” of the crisis in Gaza. Lazzarini called for support for a humanitarian ceasefire, a continuous flow of humanitarian aid and support for the UNRWA.
Hundreds of thousands of people marched peacefully through central London yesterday to protest against Israel’s continued bombardment of Gaza. The Metropolitan police said about 300,000 people had converged on the capital from all parts of the country, while organisers of the pro-Palestinian event put the number closer to 800,000 and claimed it was one of the biggest marches in British history.
In case you missed our live blog on the London protests earlier, the Metropolitan police said around 300,000 people had converged on the UK capital, while organisers of the event put the number closer to 800,000 and claimed it was one of the biggest marches in British history.
The attendance will add to political pressure on both the prime minister Rishi Sunak and the Labour leader Keir Starmer to back calls for a ceasefire in the conflict.
Around 150 pro-Palestinian demonstrators were detained by police in Grosvenor Place, Belgravia in the evening. According to the Met, the breakaway group from the main march were firing fireworks and many were wearing face coverings. Arrests were made after some of the fireworks struck officers in the face.
Matt Twist, assistant commissioner at the Met, said a further 126 people had been arrested as police sought to stop a group of far-right counter-protesters from ambushing the main rally. Scuffles broke out as police attempted to stop a crowd of far-right activists, Islamophobes and football supporters carrying St George’s flags.
In a statement, he called the extreme violence from rightwing protestors towards the police “extraordinary” and “deeply concerning”.
Rishi Sunak condemned “violent scenes” from the far-right group the English Defence League and associated groups and “Hamas sympathisers”.
Here is our full story:
Three young Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said on Saturday.
One of those killed was from the town of Jenin while the other two were from Arraba, a town to the southwest, Reuters reports.
Levels of violence in the occupied West Bank have been rising fast. You can read Jason Burke’s report here about how even though Jenin has long been a flashpoint between Hamas and Israeli security forces, clashes have intensified dramatically in the last month.

Here are some images coming through the newswires of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators that marched around the world over the weekend in pro-Palestine rallies amid Israel’s deadly airstrikes across Gaza that have killed over 11,000 Palestinians within the last month:

Dr. Mohammed Obeid, a surgeon at Al Shifa hospital, shared his testimony with Médecins Sans Frontières today, saying:

We are nearly sure that we are alone now. No one hears us...

Gaza’s border authority announced on Saturday that the Rafah land crossing into Egypt would reopen on Sunday for foreign passport holders and dependents.
Reuters reports:
The crossing between Gaza and Egypt’s Sinai peninsula is the only entry into the strip not controlled by Israel, and has been crucial for aid trucks and evacuees, who number in the thousands.
Evacuations from the Gaza Strip into Egypt, including for Palestinians needing urgent medical treatment, were suspended on Friday, Egyptian and Palestinian sources said, due to problems transporting medical evacuees from northern Gaza.
The border would begin operating at 9am local time (0700 GMT) for foreigners and medical evacuees, Egyptian sources said.
Here are some images coming through the newswires from Gaza where more than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes while thousands more remain trapped in shelters and hospitals amid Israel’s deadly siege with scarce food, water and medical aid.
Here is Agence France-Presse’s report on the thousands of Palestinians trapped inside Gaza’s Dar al-Shifa hospital amid deadly Israeli strikes:
Thousands of displaced Palestinians looked to Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, as a safe haven, but with Israeli strikes intensifying and the fighting reaching the gates of the compound, there seems nowhere for them to escape.
Ahmed al-Shawa, who sought refuge in the hospital, said he was afraid he would be “cut down by shrapnel,” if he stepped outside.
“The situation is very, very dangerous,” the 18-year-old from Gaza City said as the sound of explosions echoed in the background.
Crowds of people have crammed into the corridors of Al-Shifa to escape the fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, adding to the overwhelming number of war casualties at the hospital.
The facility was hit repeatedly overnight in a new round of strikes that knocked out the power for several hours, its director said.
The outage had resulted in the death of two premature babies, the NGO Physicians for Human Rights Israel said, citing doctors inside the hospital.
Many of the displaced were afraid to leave the hospital, with medics including from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) saying they saw people being shot at as they attempted to flee the hospital.
“We are being killed here, please do something,” a nurse from MSF pleaded from inside the hospital’s basement, where he and his family were sheltering.
“The shelling is so close, my kids are crying and screaming in fear,” MSF cited the nurse as saying in a text message.
The Israeli military said “there is no shooting at the hospital” but acknowledged troops were engaged in clashes with Hamas militants around the complex.
Médecins Sans Frontières reports that medical staff in Gaza have become so overwhelmed by the amount of incoming patients that the surgical board used to keep track of upcoming surgeries has been erased and replaced with the following words:
“Whoever stays until the end will tell the story. We did what we could. Remember us.”

What is happening at Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital and why?,2023-11-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/what-is-happening-at-al-shifa-hospital-and-why,"Al-Shifa is a strategic objective for Israel but Hamas denies it has a military base beneath the hospital
Hundreds of patients, including dozens of babies, remain trapped inside Gaza’s largest hospital as Israeli troops and Hamas militants take part in heavy fighting outside it. What is happening there and why?
The Dar al-Shifa (House of Healing) hospital is a sprawling complex of medical facilities in Gaza City, in the north of Gaza. Located about 500 metres from the coast and a major north-south road, it comprises a group of six-storey buildings that dominate the skyline. With between 600 and 900 beds and thousands of staff, it was the mainstay of healthcare provision locally, with a range of services that few of the other hospitals in Gaza could offer. Since the beginning of the war in Gaza, it has become a shelter for those displaced by the fighting and continuing Israeli bombardment.
Israel claims that Hamas has built its headquarters in bunkers and tunnels under the hospital, effectively using the building, patients and staff as a human shield. Security officials have also said that, after the surprise attacks into Israel by Hamas which killed 1,200 Israelis, mainly civilians in their homes or at a dance party, the senior Hamas leaders have been based in a “command complex” under the hospital.
At a recent press conference an IDF spokesperson displayed a satellite photograph of the hospital site with military “command” elements marked on it, which it described as an illustration based on “the true material that we have in our hands”. In footage said to be from an interrogation, a Hamas militant captured last month described how Hamas had “hidden in the hospitals”. Israel has also released other evidence apparently showing tunnels close to or in other medical facilities in Gaza.
Hamas and officials of the Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza have denied the claims, saying they are propaganda used to justify attacks on health facilities. Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British doctor working at al-Shifa described the Israeli claim as an “outlandish excuse”. Human Rights Watch, the US campaign group, said it could not corroborate the Israeli allegation.
Thousands of people have fled al-Shifa but health officials say remaining patients were dying due to energy shortages amid intense fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas militants. Life-saving equipment such as incubators cannot run without fuel to run generators. At least 32 patients, including three premature babies, had died over the past three days, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said.
There are between 600 and 650 inpatients at al-Shifa, as well as 200 to 500 health workers, and about 1,500 displaced people seeking shelter there, according to information shared with the World Health Organization, which was posted on Sunday on X.
The Israeli military said it was providing safe corridors for people to escape intense fighting in the north and move south, but Palestinian officials inside al-Shifa said the compound was surrounded by constant heavy gunfire and that Israeli snipers are all around.
There are various scenarios. Israeli forces might try to fight their way into the hospital, though this has huge political and diplomatic risks. Hamas might decide to withdraw from Gaza City, possibly via tunnels, to the south of Gaza, though this is unlikely. A ceasefire – possibly after the conclusion of a deal for the partial release of the more than 240 hostages that Hamas seized last month – would allow humanitarian organisations, the IDF or other actors to organise a full evacuation or get vital supplies to the hospital.
Not any longer. Al-Shifa has become a strategic objective for Israel, which sees the hospital as the nerve centre of Hamas’ administrative and military capabilities. For Hamas and its supporters, it has become a symbol of the organisation’s ability to fight against a militarily more powerful foe. For millions across the world, it has come to epitomise the suffering of innocent civilians. More than 11,000 people, about 40% of them children, have been killed, according to Palestinian authorities, and more than half of the population of Gaza have been made homeless.

Tony Blair ‘discussing situation’ in Gaza and open to role in effort to end crisis,2023-11-13,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/13/tony-blair-discussing-situation-in-bid-to-end-israel-and-palestine-crisis,"Former UK PM has let it be known he is available to help but his office denies he has been offered specific job
Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, has let it be known that he is available if needed to help in an effort to end the growing crisis in Israel and Palestine.
His office, however, denied a report in the Israeli press that he had already been offered a specific job.
Blair has built extensive contacts in the Middle East, and he worked as special envoy for the Quartet – the UN, the US, the EU and Russia – after leaving Downing Street in 2007, trying to build the Middle East economy.
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, would not reject a role for Blair. Both the EU and UN have Middle East envoys.
Blair has strong contacts with the Gulf states. In an earlier period, he played a role behind the scenes encouraging Hamas to change its stance towards Israel, but he has always been implacably opposed to the direction of the Iranian leadership.
His spokesperson said: “As you know, Mr Blair has an office in Israel and has continued to work on issues regarding Israel and the Palestinians. He is obviously discussing the situation with a number of people in the region and elsewhere to see what can be done. But there is no ‘role’ offered or taken.”
It was unlikely Blair would take on a role unless there was a genuine chance to change course on the humanitarian side, an ally said, a sentiment that suggested he would not want to take on a job if there was no change in the Israeli belief that this was a conflict that could be won militarily.
One source added: “Nothing is discussed or decided yet.”
Blair admitted to the journalist Donald Macintyre, the author of a study of Gaza, in 2017 that he regretted the western decision not to engage with Hamas after it won legislative elections in the Palestinian territories in 2006, leaving Hamas largely ostracised and short of political, as opposed to military, options. He said in retrospect the west should have tried to pull Hamas into dialogue.
Blair was appointed Quartet envoy immediately after leaving No 10 in 2007, and resigned in 2015. His job was not general peacemaking, but had a narrower focus on technical topics such as increasing humanitarian aid, strengthening the Palestinian economy, and bolstering governance in the occupied territories, including the Palestinian Authority.

In the role he found himself fighting relatively small battles with Israel to remove dozens of Israeli checkpoints in the West Bank, ease the movement of workers, and free the transport of Palestinian products to markets. He also helped boost tourism in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, and helped secure thousands of permits for Palestinian labourers to work in Israel.
Ultimately the scale of the Israeli blockade, born out of Israel’s security fears, made the job untenable since without political coexistence, there was little chance of economic progress on the West Bank.

Archbishop of Canterbury makes ‘moral cry’ for Israel-Hamas ceasefire,2023-11-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/british-palestinians-demand-meeting-rishi-sunak-gaza-ceasefire,"Justin Welby’s call came as British Palestinians with relatives in Gaza demanded a meeting with the prime minister
The archbishop of Canterbury has called for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas, saying the scale of civilian deaths and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza could not be “morally justified”.
“The killing must stop,” Justin Welby said, adding that the call for a ceasefire was a “moral cry”.
In his opening address to the Church of England synod, meeting in London, Welby said: “As a religious leader I can say that the killing of so many civilians, the extensive damage to civilian infrastructure cannot be morally justified.
“I do not have military or political answers to this crisis. I do not speak from those perspectives. But the call for a ceasefire is a moral cry that we are hearing from people of many faiths and none.
“Our common humanity must find another way to achieve justice, security and peaceful coexistence for Israelis and Palestinians from now, for the future,” he added. “In Christ’s name, we cry out from our hearts: ‘No more. The killing must stop.’”
Welby also called for Israeli hostages being held by Hamas to be released, and said aid must be allowed to reach people in Gaza. His speech developed a tougher line he signalled in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, at the weekend, when he said the “relentless bombardment of hospitals and civilians in Gaza … must stop, and stop now”.
Welby’s intervention came as British Palestinians with relatives in Gaza demanded a meeting with the prime minister to press for the UK government to back a ceasefire, saying its position is “putting our loved ones in danger”.
A letter sent on Monday to Rishi Sunak on behalf of members of the Palestinian community in the UK said their “voices as British citizens with friends and family under attack in Gaza” had been ignored.
Six people spoke about losing members of their families in Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip at a press conference in central London. They all appealed to the government to back calls for a ceasefire.
Omar Mofeed, an accountant who has lived in London since 2013, has lost more than 40 relatives. His brother, the only plastic and reconstruction surgeon in Gaza, who trained and worked at St Thomas’ hospital in London until February, was trapped in al-Shifa hospital, which is surrounded by Israeli troops. There was no power, water or food, and there was no way of burying dead bodies, he said.
He read the names of his relatives who had been killed, saying: “These people are not just numbers”.
Wafa Shamalakh, a medical interpreter and nutritionist, said she had experienced “unimaginable misery” as 30 members of her family, including seven children, had been killed. Her “beloved, vibrant family was wiped out in a matter of seconds”.
She added: “We will not be silenced. We will keep fighting and speaking for all the innocent people murdered by the Israeli occupation. We are the voices of the voiceless. I will not let my family or anyone die in vain.”
Ehab al-Sharief, an engineer in a technology company, said Gaza was seen as a place of bombing and death, but “my Gaza” was one of beaches, children’s voices and people who were generous and resilient: a “Gaza of hope”.
His cousin had been killed while queueing for bread two weeks ago. The “first thing we do every morning, and the last thing every evening, is to check your mobile” to see if family members were still alive, he said.
The UK Palestinian community was in a “state of deep shock and mourning following the terrible events” since 7 October , said the letter signed by Tayab Ali, the director of the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians, on behalf of the British Palestinian families. “All of us are grieving for our lost family members and friends who are victims in the ongoing Israeli operation in Gaza. Our loved ones are still in grave danger.”
The letter said they had engaged in “all possible democratic tools to ask the UK government to call for an immediate ceasefire, which has been repeatedly refused. Instead, the government has called for ‘humanitarian pauses’, which are inadequate in protecting our family and loved ones in Gaza.
The UK government should “urgently exert its influence to secure a ceasefire in Gaza”, the letter said. The relatives also demanded their families in Gaza be permitted to “immediately apply for the UK resettlement scheme”.
They added: “As British Palestinians with families in Gaza we request an urgent meeting with you to express our concerns, similar to the meetings you have had with other British communities who have families in the region who have experienced distress similar to ours as a result of the conflict between the Israeli government and Hamas.”

‘In the circle of death’: Gaza doctors say patients are under siege in al-Shifa,2023-11-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/in-the-circle-of-death-gaza-doctors-say-patients-are-under-siege-in-al-shifa,"Staff say they fear rising numbers of deaths at hospital on third day without power, and with shooting and bombing outside
Dozens of corpses lay on the courtyard outside Gaza’s largest hospital, covering the ground next to a blue refrigerated truck that had long ceased to be able to keep the bodies cool. Most of the bodies were shrouded in colourful blankets originally meant for the living, after the hospital ran out of white bodybags. A severely burnt arm protruded from one of the blankets. Elsewhere, according to video footage seen by the Guardian, the charred body of a child was visible among the soft folds of the material.
“We are under siege,” said Munir al-Boursh, a doctor who is also a Palestinian health ministry undersecretary, speaking from inside Dar al-Shifa hospital. The facility had intended to dig a mass grave until Israeli tanks and snipers encircled the the complex on Friday, making movement around it impossible.
“There are 110 dead bodies in front of the hospital, some in the refrigerator which isn’t functioning, and some just in the open space in front of the emergency unit. This could become a source of disease,” he said.
Six hundred patients as well as 200 to 500 health workers, and about 1,500 displaced people are seeking shelter at the hospital, according to information shared with the World Health Organization. Six bombardments struck the hospital complex in recent days, including the intensive care unit, doctors have said.
Boursh said: “No one can get out or come inside, it’s too risky. Israeli forces said there was a safety corridor through the eastern gate so people could exit and some people did try to get out that way. But there was shooting right in front of them, and they were so scared that they turned back.”
Israel says Hamas operates from bunkers underneath al-Shifa. Hamas and hospital staff have denied this. UN officials and rights experts have stressed that Palestinian armed groups should never use hospitals to hide, nor should Israel use claims they are doing so as a pretext to attack hospitals.
The Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry said at least 11,180 people had died in the Israeli assault on Gaza, which began on 7 October after Hamas militants stormed Israeli towns and kibbutzim around the territory, killing an estimated 1,200 people and taking 240 hostage. Supplies of fuel, electricity and water to Gaza have since been cut.
Medical staff said they were terrified that deaths among the patients holed up inside could rise, with the hospital on its third day without fuel or power. As a result, dozens in the intensive care unit were at risk of death, as well as at least 45 patients on dialysis machines. Thirty-six premature babies were moved out of the neonatal unit and into an operating theatre after bombardment of the wing of the hospital that previously housed them.
Boursh said: “There’s no oxygen supplies and no light for surgeries. We turned off six operating theatres as they are dark, and we’re doing operations in recovery areas as those are the only places that have light. We’re dependent on solar energy not fuel.
“We have no generators as those need fuel to run. There is no food, no water, no electricity and no fuel in Shifa and we are here dealing with casualties.
“We can’t manage this huge number of cases. If people come, we can’t do anything for them.”
The Palestinian health ministry in the West Bank town of Ramallah said that at least nine patients and six children had died at al-Shifa, formerly the cornerstone of Gaza’s health system, as a result of the fuel shortages and department closures after the hospital was encircled by Israeli forces.
“Patients are dying at a higher rate than before,” Nidal Abuhadrous, the head of neurosurgery at al-Shifa, said in a text message sent to the organisation Medical Aid for Palestinians. “The situation in al-Shifa is extremely difficult and dangerous. There is continuous shooting and bombing around.”
“The hospital is not functioning as a hospital any more,” he said. “We, the medical staff, are asking for a safe corridor to leave the hospital with the patients, guaranteed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.”
Boursh said the hospital was ready to accept an offer of 300 litres of diesel fuel from Israeli forces stationed outside, but that the facility’s director would only receive it from the ICRC, fearing the danger of moving around.
The amount of fuel offered was barely enough to power the generators inside al-Shifa for half an hour, he said. “We consume at least 500 litres per hour to run our generators, we need around 10,000 litres each day. Three hundred litres is nothing.”
Dr Medhat Abass from the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said he was unable to reach his colleagues inside al-Shifa and several other hospitals across the besieged territory, and that instead he had begun listening to local radio hoping to hear some of the doctors giving interviews so he would know they were alive.
“This is war time, and it is miserable,” he said. His office added that the al-Shifa medical complex was “in the circle of death, after Israeli military vehicles advanced to its eastern-southern gate where the maternity hospital is located”.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said it had been deluged with “hundreds of calls ... from Palestinians besieged in Gaza City, with helpless cries for ambulances to attend to the wounded and killed, and to help evacuate families who are stuck in their houses that are subject to continuous shelling, lacking safety, water or food”.
Many calls described large numbers of people buried alive under rubble and large numbers of injuries, it said. .
A PRCS convoy intended to help evacuate the besieged al-Quds hospital in Gaza City, which closed on Sunday for lack of fuel, turned back after gunfire and shelling in the area around the facility.
The convoy was unable to reach al-Quds, operated by the PRCS, “due to relentless bombardment and dangerous situation where the hospital is located”, the group said.
Médecins Sans Frontières said it was had been able to reach its staff inside al-Shifa hospital after several hours of communications blackout, with one describing the worsening situation and fears that evacuating even the most desperate cases would be impossible under fire.
“We don’t have electricity. There’s no water in the hospital. There’s no food. People will die in a few hours without functioning ventilators,” they said.
Boursh said he feared that no other place in Gaza would be able to accommodate the 600 patients inside the hospital, despite their desire for a safe evacuation, as al-Shifa had long been the largest and best-equipped facility in Gaza.
“We only accept an evacuation if some of these patients can go to Egypt and get good treatment, rather than being thrown into the streets, and go where exactly?” he said.
“In their homes, no one can take care of them. We have patients who have had abdominal surgery, chest surgery, without treatment they will get infected and die, and I will not allow our patients to die.”

Israeli forces at gates of Gaza’s main hospital with hundreds trapped,2023-11-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/israeli-forces-at-gates-of-gaza-main-hospital-hundreds-trapped-israel-hamas,"Health officials say patients dying due to energy shortages as fighting between Israel and Hamas intensifies
Israeli forces have reached the gates of Gaza’s largest hospital as hundreds of patients, including dozens of babies, remained trapped inside.
Thousands of people have fled al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, but health officials said the remaining patients were dying due to energy shortages amid intense fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas militants.
At least 32 patients, including three premature babies, had died over the past three days, Gaza’s health ministry said. Life-saving equipment such as incubators cannot run without fuel to run generators.
“Yesterday I had 39 babies and today they have become 36,” Dr Mohamed Tabasha, head of the paediatric department at Shifa, said in a telephone interview on Monday with Reuters. “I cannot say how long they can last. I can lose another two babies today, or in an hour.”
Israel has imposed what it calls a “complete siege” on Gaza for more than a month, allowing in only a trickle of supplies.
The Israeli military said it was providing safe corridors for people to escape intense fighting in the north and move south, but Palestinian officials inside Shifa said the compound was surrounded by constant heavy gunfire.
Fighting has been concentrating in a tightening circle around Shifa’s gates since Israeli ground forces entered Gaza, after Hamas militants killed at least 1,200 people and abducted 240 hostages in Israel in a surprise attack on 7 October.
The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has repeatedly said Hamas operates from bunkers underneath Shifa. This has been denied by Hamas and hospital staff.
UN officials and rights experts have stressed that hospitals should never be used by Palestinian armed groups to hide, nor should those claims be used by Israel as a pretext to attack them.
There are between 600 and 650 inpatients at Shifa, as well as 200 to 500 health workers, and about 1,500 displaced people seeking shelter there, according to information shared with the World Health Organization.
The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a post on X that Shifa was “not functioning as a hospital any more”.
The WHO has previously said that forcing some critically ill patients to flee hospitals in Gaza would be a “death sentence”.
Another hospital in Gaza City, al-Quds, was forced to shut down on Sunday because it had run out of fuel.
The Palestinian Red Crescent, which operates the facility, said Israeli forces were stationed nearby and that preparations were being made to evacuate 6,000 patients, medics and displaced people. However, fighting could block their escape. The IDF published footage online on Monday that it said showed a militant with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher inside the hospital grounds.
As the war entered its sixth week, fresh clashes on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and more US airstrikes on Iran-linked militia targets in neighbouring Syria renewed fears of a wider regional conflagration.
Pressure is growing on Israel to agree to a ceasefire as allies including France and the US expressed growing concern at the death toll in Gaza. More than 11,000 people have been killed, about 40% of them children, and more than half of the population have been made homeless, Palestinian authorities have said.
Joe Biden, the US president, offered muted criticism of Israeli tactics around al-Shifa on Monday, saying: “It’s my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action relative to the hospital. The hospital must be protected.”
The EU’s 27 countries issued a statement on Sunday demanding “immediate humanitarian pauses” in Gaza and condemning Hamas for using medical facilities and civilians as “human shields”.
Ashraf al-Qidra, the Gaza health ministry spokesperson who was inside Shifa on Monday, said an Israeli tank was stationed at the hospital gate. “The tank is outside the gate of the outpatient clinic department, this is how the situation looks this morning.”
Israel has told civilians to leave and medics to send patients elsewhere. It says it has attempted to evacuate babies from the neonatal ward and left 300 litres of fuel to power emergency generators at the hospital entrance, but that the offers were blocked by Hamas.
Qidra denied rejecting the offers of fuel but said the 300 litres would power the hospital for only half an hour. Shifa needed 8,000-10,000 litres of fuel a day, which must be delivered by the Red Cross or an international aid agency, he said.
On Monday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said Israel’s navy had struck one of its facilities in southern Gaza.
Philippe Lazzarini, the UNRWA commissioner general, said: “This recent attack is yet another indication that nowhere in Gaza is safe. Not the north, not the middle areas and not the south. The disregard for the protection of civilian infrastructure including UN facilities, hospitals, schools, shelters and places of worship is testament to the level of horror that civilians in Gaza are living every day.”
UN aid agencies observed a minute’s silence on Monday for 101 staff members killed in Gaza so far, the largest toll of humanitarian workers in any war since the global body was founded after the second world war.
The UN has run a huge operation for generations in Gaza, where most residents are refugee families from the wars surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948.

US officials sign memo criticizing White House for ‘unwillingness to de-escalate’ Israel-Hamas war,2023-11-13,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/13/memo-biden-white-house-israel-hamas-war,"Memo gives glimpse of intense internal opposition to Biden’s strategy in the war, in which he has maintained support for Israel
One hundred US government officials from the state department and international development agency have signed an internal memo criticizing the White House for “disregarding the lives of Palestinians” and for showing an “unwillingness to de-escalate” in the Israel-Hamas war.
The memo, obtained by Axios, gives a glimpse of the intense internal opposition to Joe Biden’s strategy in the five-week war. The US president has maintained firm support for Israel’s right to defend itself following the 7 October Hamas attack while urging greater humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians in the besieged enclave.
The memo, which Axios reports was organized by a “junior diplomat” within the state department, blames Biden for failing to counter Israeli “war crimes” in Gaza. It says that the Biden administration has “doubled down on our unwavering military assistance to the [Israeli government] without clear or actionable redlines”.
Meanwhile, Israel has proceeded to cut off electricity and aid to Gaza, which the memo says “all constitute war crimes and/or crimes against humanity under international law”.
More than 11,000 people have been killed since the Israeli offensive in Gaza began, about 40% of whom are children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
According to Axios, the memo was sent to the policy office of the state department on 3 November. It was sent through an approved channel within the agency that allows for the expression of private misgivings about official government policy in what are known as “dissent cables”.
The cables are intended to allow diplomats to raise objections to state department strategy without fear of reprisals. They were set up in the wake of the Vietnam war as a form of internal checks and balances, but they are meant to remain private.
The Axios report adds to a trickle of stories that give a sense of the fierce disagreements over the war raging inside the US government. Politico revealed last week the contents of a separate dissent memo from state department officials calling for the US to demand a ceasefire.
The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, met a group of disaffected diplomats last month to hear their frustrations about official US policy on the war, the Huffington Post reported.
The latest dissent cable accuses the Biden administration of failing to reassess the US posture towards Israel in the wake of the civilian catastrophe unfolding inside Gaza. It says: “Members of the White House displayed a clear disregard for the lives of Palestinians, a documented unwillingness to de-escalate, and, even prior to [7 October], a reckless lack of strategic foresight.”
The memo singles out Biden for personal criticism, accusing him of “spreading misinformation”. Without giving specifics, Axios said, it points to a speech made by the president three days after the initial Hamas attack in which he decried the killings by the militant group as an “act of sheer evil”.

"Palestinians digging mass graves inside al-Shifa hospital, health official says",2023-11-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/14/people-flee-northern-gaza-as-fighting-continues,"Another 200,000 people flee northern Gaza as fighting rages around territory’s biggest health facility
Palestinians trapped inside Gaza’s biggest hospital are digging mass graves, with no means of keeping corpses from decomposing due to Israel’s siege, an official there says.
“We are planning to bury them today in a mass grave inside al-Shifa medical complex,” said a health ministry spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qidra. “The men are digging right now as we speak.”
With Israeli forces at the gates of the complex, and fighting raging with Hamas militants in the streets of Gaza City, patients have been dying owing to energy shortages and dwindling supplies. Some of the hospital’s buildings have been bombed.
The Biden administration said on Tuesday that US intelligence supported Israel claims that Hamas was using al-Shifa as a military command centre and probably as a weapons store too.
“We have information that confirms that Hamas is using that particular hospital for a command and control mode” the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters aboard Air Force One. “That is a war crime.”
But Kirby added that the actions of Hamas did not diminish Israel’s responsibility to protect civilians in the course of its military operations.
At least 32 patients, including three premature babies, died at the weekend, the health ministry in Gaza said, and another 36 babies and other patients at al-Shifa were at risk. Life-saving equipment, such as incubators, cannot function without fuel to run generators.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said on Tuesday that more than 200,000 people had fled northern Gaza in the past 10 days.
It said only one hospital in the northern half of the blockaded Gaza Strip – al-Awda – still had electricity and was able to receive patients, with other medical facilities in sprawling Gaza City now mostly functioning as shelters for people fleeing the violence.
Those who have left in the last week join the estimated 1.5 million people – three-quarters of the blockaded territory’s population – who have already fled their homes through the Israeli military “safe routes” in the six weeks of war that has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians and 1,200 people in Israel, according to officials.
Ocha said: “Hundreds of thousands of people who are either unwilling or unable to move to the south remain in the north amid intensified hostilities. They are struggling to secure the minimum amount of water and food for survival.”
Hebrew-language media reported on Tuesday that Israeli and Palestinian officials were trying to arrange for unconscious patients and those requiring dialysis and cancer treatment to be evacuated from al-Shifa to appropriate facilities in the southern half of the strip. The reports were not immediately confirmed by medics on the ground. The Israeli military said it had started an effort to send incubators to the hospital, but it was not clear how they would be transferred.
Civilians in the area said heavy gunfire could be heard around the hospital compound. Staff at al-Shifa have said snipers were shooting at people outside, making it dangerous to move around the complex.
A World Health Organization spokesperson, Margaret Harris, said on Tuesday that the world needed to focus on “saving lives, not taking lives”.
“Somehow the understanding that a hospital must be a safe haven, a place where people come to be cured, to be treated when they are in trouble, when they are in need, it has been forgotten,” Harris said. “There seems to be a trend to want to turn them into places of death, despair and danger, which should never happen.”
A spokesperson for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he was deeply disturbed by the “dramatic loss of life” in Gaza hospitals. “In the name of humanity, the secretary general calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” said the spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric.
The US president, Joe Biden, said on Monday that he hoped the Israeli military would proceed with a “less intrusive” operation at al-Shifa, adding that Palestinian civilians must be protected.
Israel says al-Shifa sits above the “nerve centre” of the Palestinian militant group’s operations. Israel has not provided conclusive evidence, but the group often fires rockets from densely crowded residential areas and maintains a vast tunnel network.
UN officials have said Israel’s claims of militant activity in hospitals, whether true or false, do not absolve it from an obligation to spare civilian life.
The war, the fifth in Gaza since Hamas seized control of the strip in 2007 and already the bloodiest in the 75-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was sparked by an unprecedented assault by Hamas in which militants massacred hundreds of Israeli civilians and took 240 hostage. Three weeks of Israeli airstrikes, one of the most intense such campaigns anywhere in the world this century, were followed by a ground invasion.
Israeli troops and tanks have slowly but steadily cut off Gaza City as talks mediated by Qatar and the US on releasing hostages and brokering a humanitarian pause or ceasefire have stalled. The Israeli military has ordered Palestinian civilians to move south of the Gaza river to “safe zones” but there has also been intense bombing in the southern half of the strip.
In southern Gaza on Tuesday, young men carrying a man wounded from an Israeli strike rushed into Nasser hospital, one of the few medical centres still open.
At the same hospital, in the city of Khan Younis, relatives of those killed in Israeli attacks wept as their bodies were transferred from the morgue to be buried.
A French hospital ship is expected to arrive in the region in the next few days, and the UAE is setting up a field hospital in Gaza’s south, but these measures are unlikely to alleviate the humanitarian crisis for the 2.3 million Gaza population. The coastal territory, already impoverished by the 16-year-old Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after the Hamas takeover, has been left in ruins by the Israeli bombing campaign: about 45% of houses have been damaged or destroyed, along with 279 educational facilities, the UN said on Monday.
Clean water, food and medical supplies are scarce. A tiny fraction of the aid that used to reach Gaza every day has entered from Egypt. Rubbish is piling up in the streets, increasing the risk of diseases such as cholera and dysentery.
Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, said on Monday that he believed that the international community would press Israel to wind down its operations in Gaza in the next two to three weeks. “From a political standpoint, we are starting to see that pressure on Israel has begun. That pressure isn’t very high, but it is in an upward trend … we will continue in any event according to plan,” he told reporters.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas as a military and governing power in Gaza, but it is not clear what it plans to do with the territory after the fighting subsides.
A senior far-right member of the Israeli government, the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said on Tuesday that Palestinians should “voluntarily” leave Gaza for other countries.
Palestinians have accused Israel of seeking a new Nakba, or catastrophe, the mass displacement of 700,000 Palestinians in wars surrounding the founding of the state of Israel in 1948.
On Saturday, Avi Dichter, a member of the Israeli security cabinet member and agriculture minister, said in a television interview: “We are now rolling out the Gaza Nakba.” The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, warned cabinet ministers the next day to choose their words carefully.
An unverified video published online showed what appeared to be Israeli soldiers in front of bombed-out buildings, with one saying they were “conquering, expelling and settling”.On Tuesday, rocket fire by Palestinian militants in Gaza hit areas around the strip, including the city of Ashkelon, where medics said two Israelis were lightly wounded. Hours later, shrapnel from another rocket attack on Tel Aviv, wounded three people, one of them seriously.
In the north, anti-tank missiles and mortars were fired from Lebanon at Israeli military positions, and forces returned fire, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. Israel’s fighting with the powerful Iran-backed militia Hezbollah has killed about 70 Lebanese militants and 16 civilians, as well as seven Israeli soldiers and three civilians.
In the occupied West Bank, the worst violence for 20 years continued to escalate, with 182 Palestinians killed, mostly in clashes with the IDF and Israeli settlers living in the Palestinian territory. Israeli forces killed at least eight Palestinians in the West Bank on Tuesday, Palestinian medics and local media said.

‘Nobody could help us’: families tell of Gaza trauma after return to UK,2023-11-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/14/nobody-could-help-us-families-tell-of-gaza-trauma-after-return-to-uk,"People who were trapped in territory describe their ordeal and say UK must do more to stop war
Nasser Hamid Said and his family spent five weeks trapped in the city of Jabalia in northern Gaza before finally making it across the border to safety last Monday. They returned to their home in west London on Sunday but are still suffering the trauma of what they experienced.
Hamid Said, 52, still dreams he is in the conflict that has claimed the lives of members of his family. His sons are terrified by the sound of fireworks and the family is trying to forget weeks of Israeli bombardment, surviving on scarce food supplies, dirtied water and without electricity.
“I had to leave. We didn’t have any choice,” he said, recalling their journey south to the Rafah border crossing. “The British embassy couldn’t do anything, nobody could help us. If you’re not [going] to die from a bomb you will die from hunger.”
While the family is among the hundreds of foreign nationals who have escaped Israel’s airstrikes and the spiralling humanitarian crisis, more than 2 million people in Gaza, nearly half of whom are children, remain under siege after Hamas militants killed at least 1,200 people and abducted 240 hostages in a surprise attack on 7 October.
The UK government and Labour party are facing mounting pressure to back a ceasefire and calls for international laws to be upheld in the war that has killed 11,000 Palestinians and become the bloodiest chapter in the 75-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
On Monday, calls for a ceasefire were echoed by the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians, who wrote Rishi Sunak on behalf of the Palestinian community, criticising the government’s inadequate calls for “humanitarian pauses”.
When Hamid Said and his family first attempted to leave, their car was shot at by Israeli soldiers, he recalled. With only water, they walked south towards the border, as he shielded his sons, aged 8 and 12, from the surrounding dead bodies. They feared being shot by Israeli soldiers as they walked three minutes ahead of other family members so that an airstrike would not kill them all.
“I told my sons, just take up your hand with a white piece of material and come with me,” he recalled. “I didn’t want my sons to see anything that was going on.”
While they are happy to be back in London, Hamid Said thinks unhappily of the relatives who want to come to the UK, but are unable to. “We need the UK government to try to help to stop this war,” he said. “For both sides.”
Faras Abuwarda’s family were visiting loved ones in Gaza before the conflict began. Abuwarda, a legal consultant, travelled from London to Egypt twice to try to get his family out. Their names were finally included on a list of British nationals permitted to leave Gaza at the Rafah crossing last week and his wife and five children – two of whom are autistic – walked three hours south, before taking a taxi to Khan Younis.
Abuwarda was told by government officials that the air fare from Cairo to London could be lent to him in exchange for his passport, which would be returned once the money was repaid. He waited for officials to call him to book the tickets but no call came. He then decided to borrow $1,200 from friends instead.
He said they received rough treatment from government officials at the hotel in Cairo. “We did not get any words of solidarity, or actually care [for] the family at all,” he said. At the hotel, the family of seven was split into two rooms each with a single double bed, and Abuwarda slept on the floor.
Abuwarda and his family are now safe in London. His children have returned to school and he is preparing to return to work after taking sick leave, but he constantly thinks of his family left behind in Jabalia and is deeply critical of the UK government’s failure to help Palestinians.
“I’m still very disappointed by the government attitude the way they dealt with us British citizens in Gaza,” he said. “We need the government to help to bring our family as well. Same as the offer for the Ukrainian people.”

Starmer under pressure to back Labour amendment on Gaza ceasefire,2023-11-14,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/14/starmer-under-pressure-to-back-labour-amendment-on-gaza-ceasefire,"Party leader warned that Labour MPs likely to vote for SNP motion calling for immediate halt to fighting
Keir Starmer is facing growing pressure to support a Labour amendment backing a ceasefire in Gaza to head off the possibility of his own MPs voting for an SNP motion that will call for an immediate halt to the fighting.
A meeting of Labour’s parliamentary party (PLP) on Monday was described as “a bin fire” by one MP, with a separate campaign by pro-ceasefire Labour members launching on Tuesday.
“Everyone is begging [Starmer] to do it,” they said after the highly charged meeting late on Monday night, where the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, attempted to hold the party line.
When the king’s speech debate comes to an end on Wednesday, it is likely there will be a vote on the SNP’s amendment, which calls on the government to “join with the international community in urgently pressing all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire”.
Starmer is facing a rebellion by as many as a dozen shadow ministers, who sources say are ready to resign rather than vote against calling for a ceasefire in the Middle East, which Starmer has refused to back.
Pressed on whether Labour MPs would be allowed a free vote, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said on Tuesday that MPs “didn’t know” in terms of what the speaker would pick in terms of amendments, and “would address that” tomorrow.
“There [are] a number of amendments down at the moment we don’t know what the vote will be on,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
Pressed on what would need to happen in terms of the death toll before Labour backed a ceasefire, she said: “The numbers are already too high. Far too many innocent people in Israel and Gaza have lost their lives.”
“The way to stop this killing and the way to save lives is for the international community to come together and put pressure both on Hamas to release the hostages,” she said, adding that the international community also had to put pressure on the Israeli government to show “more restraint”.
A campaign to put pressure on the Labour leadership to back a ceasefire will meanwhile also be launched on Tuesday by Mish Rahman, a member of Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) from the West Midlands.
“We have seen leaders, who claim to represent us, rule out the commitment to a ceasefire which would put an end to the terrible violence, open up the opportunity for talks and a move towards a peaceful solution,” Rahman said on a new website, which is collecting signatures to support the Labour for a Ceasefire Now campaign.
“How many more children must die before our party advocates for peace? It is time for change. It is time to end mealy mouthed politics. It is time for political triangulation to change. It is now that there is time for honesty – we need a politics of peace.”
Before the end of the king’s speech debate, a script seen last week by the Guardian instructed Labour party whips to be firm with frontbenchers, and “point out that if Labour was in government they would have to vote against”.
Starmer has said he understands the “emotions” behind the ceasefire calls of some in the party.

Film-makers pull out after Amsterdam festival condemns Palestine protest,2023-11-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/14/film-makers-pull-out-after-amsterdam-festival-condemns-palestine-protest,"Twelve documentary makers withdraw after organisers condemn use of ‘From the river to the sea’ by onstage protesters
A dozen film-makers and artists have withdrawn their work from the world’s largest documentary festival after its organisers strongly condemned the use of the slogan “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” at an opening-night protest.
During a speech by the artistic director of the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), Orwa Nyrabia, at the start of the event last Thursday, three activists took to the stage holding a sign with the slogan, which some say is a call for a secular state in historic Palestine but which others note is used by radical Islamist groups to promote the eradication of Israel.
Nyrabia reportedly joined sections of the audience in applauding the intervention, but later said he could not see the words on the banner from where he sat on stage. “I clapped to welcome freedom of speech and not to welcome the slogan,” he said, adding that the slogan was “a triggering statement and an offensive declaration for many, regardless of who carries it”.
The organisers of the IDFA, which runs until 19 November, said the use of the words went against their aim to provide a safe space for civic debate. “There are many ways that people use or read this slogan, and that various sides use it in opposing ways, all of which we do not agree with, and we believe that this slogan should not be used in any way and by anybody any more”, the IDFA said.
Before the film festival issued its statement, 16 leading figures from the Israeli film industry signed an open letter expressing their “uttermost dismay, disappointment and concern” at the opening-night protest and reports of its positive reception.
The IDFA’s statement on “from the river to the sea” in turn prompted protests from the Palestine Film Institute (PFI), a national body responsible for promoting the cinema of Palestine that is usually hosted by the festival for one day each year.
As of Tuesday morning, 12 out of the 300 film-makers attending the festival had followed the PFI’s call to withdraw their films, including Basma al-Sharif, a juror of the festival’s experimental “Envision” competition.
Sharif, whose parents were born in Palestine, said “from the river to the sea” was an anti-apartheid slogan advocating a state in which people of all faiths had equal rights, and that, by denouncing it, the IDFA had aligned itself with the Israeli government’s “aggressive propaganda”.
The slogan, a reference to the land between the Jordan River, which borders eastern Israel, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, is also used in the 2017 constitution of Hamas, the Islamist militant group whose gunmen killed 1,200 people in its attack on 7 October.
Germany, which last week announced a complete ban on Hamas’s activities, now lists “from the river to the sea” as one of the marks of the radical Islamist group, meaning its use in public could count as a criminal offence similar to publicly displaying a swastika.
In the Netherlands, however, where the IDFA festival is taking place, the court of appeal last month upheld a previous ruling that the slogan deserved legal protection on free speech grounds.
Not all Palestinian film-makers have withdrawn their work from the festival. Mohamed Jabaly’s Life is Beautiful, which deals with the young Palestinian film-maker’s own statelessness, will continue to be shown.
“I want to be heard,” Jabaly told the Guardian. “Because now that everything has been destroyed, what is left are our stories and freedom of expression.”

You can see all our Israel-Hamas war coverage here and see our latest full report on the conflict here
Joe Biden has said that Gaza’s largest hospital “must be protected” and called for “less intrusive action” by Israeli forces.
Hundreds of patients, including dozens of babies, remain trapped inside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, in the north of Gaza, as Israeli troops and Hamas militants take part in heavy fighting outside it.
At least 32 patients, including three premature babies, had died over the past three days, Gaza’s health ministry said.
The US president, speaking in the Oval Office on Monday, said:
It is my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action.
The Israeli military has said it was providing safe corridors for people to escape intense fighting in the north and move south, but Palestinian officials inside Shifa have said the compound was surrounded by constant heavy gunfire.
It’s approaching 4.15am in Israel and Gaza and we’re going to pause the blog. In the meantime you can see all our Israel-Hamas war coverage here and see our latest full report on the conflict here. We’ll be back soon to bring you the latest developments.
Here’s a summary of the key events of the past day:
The Israeli military has reached the gates of Gaza’s largest hospital as hundreds of patients, including dozens of babies, remained trapped inside. Thousands of people have fled al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, but health officials said the remaining patients were dying due to energy shortages. At least 32 patients, including three premature babies, had died in the past three days, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said.
At least 11,240 Palestinians have been killed, including 4,630 children and 3,130 women in Gaza by the Israeli military since 7 October, the health ministry said on Monday.
Joe Biden has said al-Shifa “must be protected” and called for “less intrusive action” by Israeli forces. “It is my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action,” the US president said on Monday.
All of the hospitals in northern Gaza are “out of service” amid fuel shortages and intense combat, the health ministry in the besieged territory said on Monday. Two major hospitals in northern Gaza – al-Shifa and al-Quds – have closed to new patients due to Israeli airstrikes and heavy fighting around both facilities as medical staff were left without oxygen, medical supplies or fuel to power incubators.
The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA has warned that the group’s aid operations in Gaza will be shut down in the next 48 hours unless fuel is allowed into the besieged territory. UNRWA commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini said the agency’s fuel depot in Gaza had run dry and would no longer be able to resupply hospitals, remove sewage and provide drinking water.
UNRWA said that one of its schools in northern Gaza and a building designated as a residence for UN international staff in the Rafah area were directly hit by strikes. It did not say who was responsible for the strikes. The UN agency also said it had received “extremely concerning” reports that Israeli security forces had entered one UNRWA school and two UNRWA health centres in the Gaza Strip with tanks and used them for military operations. Earlier, it said one of its buildings in Rafah had been struck by Israel’s navy. Rafah is in the south of the Gaza Strip, within the area Israel has insisted Palestinians move to.
Trucks transporting desperately needed aid through the Rafah crossing from Egypt could stop operations on Tuesday due to a lack of fuel. “Humanitarian ceasefire, fuel supplies – all of these should be happening now. We are running out of time before really facing major disaster,” Andrea De Domenico, the head of the UN humanitarian affairs office in the occupied Palestinian territory, told journalists on Monday.
Israel claims it has uncovered a Hamas operations centre beneath the Rantisi children’s hospital in Gaza City, and evidence suggesting that hostages taken on 7 October were held there. Separately, CNN reported that “a US official with knowledge of American intelligence” said that Hamas had “a command node” under the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.
At least three Palestinians have been killed and 20 others injured after an Israeli airstrike hit Bani Suheila, a town east of Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip, health officials said on Monday.
The armed wing of Hamas says it discussed with Qatari mediators the release up to 70 women and children hostages in Gaza in exchange for a five-day Israeli ceasefire. Israel has rejected any possibility of a ceasefire until the release of all 240 of the hostages.
UN workers observed a minute’s silence on Monday for the more than 100 colleagues killed in Gaza since the Israel-Hamas war began last month, marking the deadliest conflict ever for UN workers. At least 101 employees of the UNRWA have been killed since 7 October.
Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, has acknowledged the growing international pressure for a ceasefire. He also estimated that Israel has a “diplomatic window” of two to three weeks before pressure on the country seriously begins to increase, local media reported.
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, has urged Joe Biden to do more to stop the “atrocities” in Gaza and help bring about a ceasefire. Widodo, the leader of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, held talks with the US president on Monday at the White House.
The EU’s humanitarian aid chief called on Monday for “meaningful” pauses in the fighting and urgent deliveries of fuel to keep hospitals working in the territory. The EU’s 27 countries issued a statement on Sunday saying hospitals “must be protected” and condemning Hamas for using the medical facilities and civilians as “human shields”.
One hundred US government officials from the state department and international development agency have signed an internal memo criticising the White House for “disregarding the lives of Palestinians” and for showing an “unwillingness to de-escalate” in the Israel-Hamas war.
The archbishop of Canterbury has called for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas, saying the scale of civilian deaths and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza cannot be “morally justified”.
The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has set out proposals for how Gaza should be run after the war between Israel and Hamas. EU foreign ministers are also looking at a Cypriot proposal to open up a maritime corridor for urgent humanitarian aid for Gaza.
Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, has let it be known that he is available if needed to help in an effort to end the growing crisis in Israel and Palestine. His office, however, denied a report in the Israeli press that he had already been offered a specific job.
A photographer in Gaza has taken these images of relatives mourning for those killed in an Israeli attack on the al-Sharafi family’s apartment in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip.
Biden’s National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has confirmed that Washington, which has firmly backed Israel over its offensive against Hamas, has raised the issue of protecting Gaza’s hospitals with its ally. Agence France-Presse reports:
“We do not want to see firefights in hospitals,” he told a briefing. “We want to see patients protected, we want to see hospitals protected.”
He added: “We have spoken with the Israeli government about this and they have said they share that view that they do not want to see firefights in hospitals.”
Sullivan also said the US wanted to see “considerably longer pauses – days, not hours” in the fighting.
The White House said last week that Israel had agreed to daily four-hour humanitarian pauses in the fighting to let civilians out of northern Gaza and aid in.
Brazil’s president has accused Israel of “killing innocent people without any criteria” in the Gaza Strip, deeming its actions there “as grave” as the 7 October attacks by Palestinian militant group Hamas, Agence France-Presse reports.
At an official ceremony in Brasilia, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said:
After the act of terrorism provoked by Hamas, the consequences, the solution of the state of Israel, is as grave as that of Hamas. They are killing innocent people without any criteria.
The leader of Latin America’s largest country also accused Israel of “dropping bombs where there are children, hospitals, on the pretext that a terrorist is there.”
“This is inexplicable. First you have to save the women and children, then you fight with whomever you want,” Lula said.
Representatives of Brazil’s Jewish community denounced these remarks as “erroneous”, “unfair” and “dangerous”, adding that they “put Israel and Hamas on the same level”.
They defended the “visible and proven” efforts of the Israeli authorities “to save Palestinian civilians”.
“Our community expects balance from our authorities,” added the Israeli Confederation of Brazil, which claims to represent some 120,000 Brazilian Jews, the second largest community in the region, in a statement.
Lula’s comments came as he welcomed to Brasilia 22 Brazilians and 10 members of their families who had been evacuated from Gaza on Sunday via the land border with Egypt, after more than a month of waiting in the conflict zone.
US secretary of state Antony Blinken has written to employees to acknowledge disagreements within the state department, CNN reported on Monday, after reports that 100 US government officials have signed a memo criticising the White House for “disregarding the lives of Palestinians”.
In his message on Monday, Blinken wrote:
I know that for many of you, the suffering caused by this crisis is taking a profound personal toll. The anguish that comes with seeing the daily images of babies, children, elderly people, women, and other civilians suffering in this crisis is wrenching. I feel it myself.
He noted that “some people in the Department may disagree with approaches we are taking or have views on what we can do better” and added that forums for employee feedback had been organised in Washington. He continued:
We’re listening: what you share is informing our policy and our messages.
He said the US’ “overarching objective” remained the same:
To bring this terrible conflict to a close as quickly as possible, while standing by Israel’s right and obligation, in full accordance with international humanitarian law, to ensure a terrorist attack like October 7th never happens again.
He also repeated that “far too many Palestinian civilians have died” and said that “much more can and should be done to reduce their suffering.” He continued:
As I said in private and in public, we believe Palestinian people’s voices must be at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza. We believe in Palestinian-led governance of Gaza, with Gaza unified with the West Bank. Gaza’s reconstruction must be supported with a sustained mechanism.
Another UNRWA staff member has been killed in Gaza due to “strikes” the UN agency for Palestinian refugees has said in its latest update, bringing the total number of UNRWA staff killed in the conflict to 102. At least 27 have been injured.
The UNRWA death toll over the past month was already the highest number of UN aid workers to be killed in a conflict in the history of the UN.
UN workers observed a minute’s silence on Monday for their colleagues killed in Gaza, as we reported earlier.
The Israeli army has confirmed the identity of a soldier being held hostage by Hamas, after the armed wing of the Palestinian group published a video showing the young woman in captivity. The army said in a statement shortly after midnight on Tuesday:
Our hearts go out to the Marciano family, whose daughter, Noa, was brutally kidnapped by the Hamas terrorist organisation.
We are using all means, both intelligence and operational, to bring the hostages home.”
It was the first time the army has officially confirmed a hostage’s identity since Hamas gunmen abducted about 240 people when they stormed across the militarised border from Gaza on October 7. AFP reports further:
On Monday night, Hamas’ Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades published a video of the soldier apparently reading a message in Hebrew in which she identified herself by name and identity card number and said she had been detained in Gaza for four days.
“An IDF (Israel Defense Forces) representative came to the family’s home and informed them of the video’s publication,” the army statement said.
“The Hamas terrorist organization continues to exploit psychological terrorism and act inhumanely, through videos and photos of the hostages, as done in the past.”

Hundreds of patients, including dozens of babies, remain trapped inside Gaza’s largest hospital as Israeli troops and Hamas militants take part in heavy fighting outside it. What is happening there and why?
The Dar al-Shifa (House of Healing) hospital is a sprawling complex of medical facilities in Gaza City, in the north of Gaza. Located about 500 metres from the coast and a major north-south road, it comprises a group of six-storey buildings that dominate the skyline. With between 600 and 900 beds and thousands of staff, it was the mainstay of healthcare provision locally, with a range of services that few of the other hospitals in Gaza could offer. Since the beginning of the war in Gaza, it has become a shelter for those displaced by the fighting and continuing Israeli bombardment.
Israel claims that Hamas has built its headquarters in bunkers and tunnels under the hospital, effectively using the building, patients and staff as a human shield. Security officials have also said that, after the surprise attacks into Israel by Hamas which killed 1,200 Israelis, mainly civilians in their homes or at a dance party, the senior Hamas leaders have been based in a “command complex” under the hospital.
Read on for more from Jason Burke’s explainer about the battle around al-Shifa hospital:
Jordan’s King Abdullah has warned that any scenario which includes the reoccupation of parts of Gaza by Israel will worsen the crisis and that continued Israeli “violations” in the West Bank and Jerusalem would “push the region towards an explosion”.
In comments reported by official news agency Petra, the king said “a military or security solution” would not succeed and said the conflict had originated in the occupation and the deprivation of rights of Palestinian people.
At a meeting with senior Jordanian politicians including former prime ministrers and the Senate president, he said Gaza must not be separated from the rest of the Palestinian territories and called for an end to the war and the resumption of a political process based on a two-state solution.
“Any other path will end in failure and lead to further cycles of violence and destruction,” he said.
Others at the meeting “noted that the King has foreseen and repeatedly warned against the dangers witnessed today as a result of Israeli violations,” Petra reported.
Jordan is home to a large population of Palestinian refugees and their descendants who fear Israel could expel Palestinians en masse from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israeli settler attacks on Palestinian inhabitants have surged since Hamas’s 7 October attack on southern Israel.
This is Helen Livingstone, taking over from my colleague Leonie Chao-Fong.
It’s 1am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
At least 11,240 Palestinians have been killed, including 4,630 children and 3,130 women in Gaza by the Israeli military since 7 October, the health ministry said on Monday.
Israeli military has reached the gates of Gaza’s largest hospital as hundreds of patients, including dozens of babies, remained trapped inside. Thousands of people have fled al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, but health officials said the remaining patients were dying due to energy shortages. At least 32 patients, including three premature babies, had died in the past three days, Gaza’s health ministry said.
Joe Biden has said that al-Shifa “must be protected” and called for “less intrusive action” by Israeli forces. “It is my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action,” the US president said on Monday.
All of the hospitals in northern Gaza are “out of service” amid fuel shortages and intense combat, the health ministry in the besieged territory said on Monday. Two major hospitals in northern Gaza – al-Shifa and al-Quds – closed to new patients due to Israeli airstrikes and heavy fighting around both facilities as medical staff were left without oxygen, medical supplies or fuel to power incubators.
The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA has warned that all of the group’s aid operations in Gaza will be shut down in the next 48 hours unless fuel is allowed into the besieged territory. UNRWA commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini said the agency’s fuel depot in Gaza has run dry and will no longer be able to re-artsupply hospitals, remove sewage and provide drinking water.
UNRWA said that one of its schools in northern Gaza and a building designated as a residence for UN international staff in the Rafah area were directly hit by strikes. In its latest update on Monday, it did not say who was responsible for the strikes. The UN agency also said it had received “extremely concerning” reports that Israeli Security Forces had entered one UNRWA school and two UNRWA health centres in the Gaza Strip with tanks and used them for military operations. Earlier, it said one of its buildings in Rafah has been struck by Israel’s navy. Rafah is in the south of the Gaza Strip, within the area Israel has insisted Palestinians move to.
Trucks transporting desperately needed aid through the Rafah crossing from Egypt could stop operations on Tuesday due to a lack of fuel. “Humanitarian ceasefire, fuel supplies – all of these should be happening now. We are running out of time before really facing major disaster,” Andrea De Domenico, the head of the UN humanitarian affairs office in the occupied Palestinian territory, told journalists on Monday.
Israel claims it has uncovered a Hamas operations center beneath the Rantisi children’s hospital in Gaza City, and evidence suggesting that hostages taken on 7 October were held there. Separately, CNN reported that “a US official with knowledge of American intelligence” said that Hamas had “a command node” under the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.
At least three Palestinians have been killed and 20 others injured after an Israeli airstrike hit Bani Suheila, a town east of Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip, health officials said on Monday.
The armed wing of Hamas says it discussed with Qatari mediators the release up to 70 women and children hostages in Gaza in exchange for a five-day Israeli ceasefire. Israel has rejected any possibility of a ceasefire until the release of all 240 of the hostages.

Indonesia appeals to the US to do more to stop the atrocities in Gaza.
He added:

Trucks transporting desperately needed aid through the Rafah crossing from Egypt could stop operations on Tuesday due to a lack of fuel, a senior UN humanitarian official has warned.
Andrea De Domenico, the head of the UN humanitarian affairs office in the occupied Palestinian territory, told journalists in New York that “lives are hanging by a thread” in Gaza, including those of babies in incubators at hospitals that depend on fuel for electricity.
Humanitarian ceasefire, fuel supplies – all of these should be happening now. We are running out of time before really facing major disaster.
On Sunday, 76 trucks delivered aid into Gaza through the Rafah crossing, he said, adding:
Actually, instead of a much-needed increase of this assistance, we have been informed by the colleagues of UNRWA that due to the lack of fuel, as of tomorrow the operations of receiving trucks will no longer be possible.
“Operational conditions in general are deteriorating by the hour,” he added.
A New York civil liberties group is suing Joe Biden for allegedly failing in his duty under international and US laws to prevent Israel committing genocide in Gaza.
The Center for Constitutional Rights’ (CCR) complaint on behalf of several Palestinian groups and individuals alleges that Israel’s actions, including “mass killings”, the targeting of civilian infrastructure and forced expulsions, amount to genocide. The CCR said that the 1948 international convention against genocide requires the US and other countries to use their power and influence to stop the killing. The complaint argued:
As Israel’s closest ally and strongest supporter, being its biggest provider of military assistance by a large margin and with Israel being the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign assistance since World War II, the United States has the means available to have a deterrent effect on Israeli officials now pursuing genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, asks the court to bar the US from providing weapons, money and diplomatic support to Israel.
It also seeks a declaration that the president, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, are required “to take all measures within their power to prevent Israel’s commission of genocidal acts against the Palestinian people of Gaza”. These include pressing Israel to end the bombing of Gaza, to lift its siege of the territory and to prevent the forcible expulsion of Palestinians.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has said that one of its schools in northern Gaza and a building designated as a residence for UN international staff in the Rafah area were directly hit by strikes.
In its daily update on Monday, the agency said UN international staff present in Rafah had left the building 90 minutes before the strike, and that no casualties were reported. The strike “is yet another indication that nowhere is safe in Gaza”, it said. It did not say who was responsible for the strikes.
The UN agency said the coordinates of the building were shared twice, including just days ago, adding:
UNRWA shares coordinates of all its facilities across the Gaza Strip with parties to the conflict.
UNRWA also said it had received “extremely concerning” reports that Israeli Security Forces (ISF) had entered one UNRWA school and two UNRWA health centres in the Gaza Strip with tanks and used them for military operations.
It cited reports that the ISF “conducted interrogations and arrests” of internally displaced people in the installations, adding:
According to the reports, IDPs were subsequently forced to leave the UNRWA installations and move south towards Wadi Gaza. Witnesses reported that Israeli Forces then struck the two health centres with artillery fire. UNRWA is further verifying these reports. If confirmed, the military use of UNRWA facilities raises serious concerns, as such use puts civilians at serious risk of harm.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has said that the only power generator at Al-Amal hospital in southern Gaza has stopped working.
In a statement posted to social media, the PRCS said the lives of 90 patients at the hospital are at risk, including 25 in the medical rehabilitation section “who now face the risk of death at any moment”.
It said the hospital is relying on a “very small” generator and that the remaining fuel is expected to run out within the 24 hours.

Russia and Israel lead global surge in attacks on civilian water supplies,2023-11-15,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/15/water-related-violence-russia-israel-report,"Exclusive: at least 228 water conflicts were recorded in 2022 – an 87% rise on the year before, Pacific Institute database shows
Water-related violence surged to an all-time high in 2022 – driven in large part by Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israeli attacks against Palestinian water resources in the West Bank.
At least 228 water conflicts were documented in 2022 – an 87% rise since 2021, according to research by the Pacific Institute shared exclusively with the Guardian.
The incidents include Israeli settlers sabotaging wells in the occupied West Bank, state violence against protesters demanding safe drinking water in Iran, nomadic pastoralists and farmers fighting over scarce supplies in sub-Saharan Africa, and Russia bombarding dams and water treatment plants in Ukraine.
Overall, violence related to water access has been rising steadily since 2000 as the climate crisis and growing scarcity exacerbate old conflicts over land, ideology and religion, economics and sovereignty – and new ones erupt, according to the Water Conflict Chronology.
In some of the most catastrophic incidents so far this year, Israel has used water as a weapon by targeting critical infrastructure and cutting off supplies to more than 2 million people in the besieged Gaza Strip – as did Russia when it destroyed the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine.
The UN recognizes access to safe, acceptable, affordable drinking water as a fundamental human right, yet more than 2 billion people, about 25% of the world’s population, still lack access. Cutting off or denying people access to safe water violates international humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions, constituting a war crime, according to UN experts.
The Pacific Institute’s tracker is the most comprehensive open-source database of water-related violence in the world, dating back over 4,500 years and containing more than 1,630 entries identified from news reports, eyewitness accounts and conflict databases.
It details events in which a water source or system – a dam, well, treatment plant, canal, pipeline, and so on – has been a trigger, weapon or casualty of violence, with the majority of data available covering conflicts since 2000.
The 2023 data is incomplete but on track to be another record or near record high.
And while water-related violence is not confined to a particular place or time, incidents are rising and disproportionately concentrated in the Middle East, southern Asia and Africa as competition intensifies amid rising demand and dwindling supplies exacerbated by the climate crisis.
“Attacks on civilian water systems, or the use of water as a weapon against civilians, is absolutely forbidden by international law. War is always horrible, but even in war there are rules of conduct and the international community must call out and punish violations of international humanitarian laws,” said Peter Gleick, co-founder of the Pacific Institute, a water thinktank which created the conflict tracker in 1985.
He added: “2023 is on track to be as bad as 2022 unless efforts to address the consequences of drought and climate change expand and/or the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East diminish.”
The first known water conflict took place in 2500BC in the Sumerian Gu’edena – or “edge of paradise” region in the ancient Middle East, a conflict over water and irrigated lands that lasted a century. The second was over the Tigris River in Babylon between 1720 and 1684BC.
The most recent data includes 56 incidents in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022 until mid-2023.
In April 2022, 106 towns in the Kherson region of Ukraine were left without water services after Russia targeted energy and water systems. In January 2023, 1 million Ukrainians – the entire population of Odesa – were temporarily left without water, again after Russian forces attacked energy and water systems.
In June this year, the explosion that destroyed the Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River left at least 50 dead and submerged multiple villages and agricultural fields, as well as cutting off the water supply for cities, power plants and irrigation systems. This type of attack qualifies the event as a weapon as well as a casualty on the tracker.
Many of Ukraine’s water facilities – used for drinking water, irrigation, industry and power plants – were concentrated in the east and south of the country, where the heaviest fighting has taken place.
Russia is responsible for most of the destruction but Ukraine has on occasion weaponized water. For instance, in May 2022, the Ukrainian armed forces destroyed the gates of a dam to slow the Russian advance toward Svitlodarsk in Donetsk.
Targeting water facilities in wartime is not new.
Last century dams were intentionally attacked during the Spanish civil war and during the second world war. For instance, the US targeted water supplies while bombing the Japanese-occupied island of Saipan in June 1944, resulting in severe shortages.
Amid ongoing fighting in Ukraine, scientists have been unable to fully assess or mitigate the damage but shortages have been reported by some communities and farmers in the south. In addition, the flooding caused by bombing and other infrastructure has probably dislodged toxins including heavy metals, oil and plastics – and landmines – downstream and possibly across international borders, according to Oleksandra Shumilova, a researcher at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries.
“The long-term consequences on the quality and quantity of water will be significant for Ukraine and globally. The big question is how can Ukraine’s water sources and ecosystems recover, and how long will it take?” said Shumilova. “Ukraine has more than a thousand reservoirs and if the war continues, they are all at risk.”
Violence over water is rising in the Middle East, with attacks in Yemen, Iraq and Syria contributing to 74 incidents in 2022 – a third of the global total.
Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan over the Helmand River are mounting, as both countries experience growing water insecurity. By 2050 every country in the region is projected to experience high water stress as populations grow and climate impacts intensify.

But Palestinians are arguably suffering the most from water violence in the region, as Israel uses violence to exert control over limited supplies in the occupied territories.
The surprise cross-border attack by Hamas on 7 October left 1,200 Israelis dead and more than 200 taken hostage. In response, relentless retaliatory attacks by Israel on Gaza have damaged or destroyed at least six water wells, three water pumping stations, one water reservoir and one desalination plant serving over 1.1 million Palestinians. UN agencies have reported dire, potentially fatal water shortages, with Palestinians forced to drink, cook and bathe in contaminated water or seawater.
Israel has also cut off electricity and fuel supplies needed to operate Gaza’s other desalination plants, and water treatment and sewage facilities.
Much of the recent water-related violence in Gaza has not yet been added to the conflict chronology.
But long before the siege on Gaza, Israel had been systematically targeting Palestinian irrigation and water supply systems in the West Bank as part of its plans to expand settlements and control the region’s very limited water supplies. Israel attacked Palestinian water sources at least 66 times between January 2022 and mid-2023 – more water-related violence than was inflicted on Ukraine during the same time period.
For instance, Israeli settlers and soldiers carried out a series of attacks against water systems in June 2022 which included filling a well with stones near Yabad, close to Jenin, and demolishing a pond used to water grapes in Bir Zayt.
In October last year, Israeli military forces destroyed a water pump that supplied water to several villages including Burin and Madama, cutting supplies to more than 20,000 Palestinians.
Earlier this year in July, Israeli occupying forces raided and looted Palestinian farmers in Hebron in the West Bank before pouring concrete into water wells to prevent the landowners from irrigating their farmland.
The frequent attacks go hand in hand with land grabs, and are carried out with almost total impunity.
Gleick, of the Pacific Institute, said: “Even before the current massive escalation of violence between Israel and Palestine, there has been a major increase in attacks by Israeli settlers or the military on Palestinian water wells, irrigation systems, pipelines and springs in the West Bank, reflecting efforts by Israel to expand settlements and control the West Bank’s very limited water sources.”
The chronology includes a small number of incidents from earlier years when Israeli water resources were targeted by residents in occupied territories and militant groups from Lebanon and Palestine.
From unpredictable rainfall patterns to floods, drought, rising sea levels and shrinking ice sheets – water is at the centre of the climate emergency and the situation will almost certainly get worse as the world continues to burn fossil fuels, according to the UN.
Climate-driven water scarcity is increasingly influencing the risk of major conflict, according to Gleick. For instance there is strong evidence that the Syrian civil war was in part triggered by severe drought that was intensified by global heating, affecting food security and the economy.
Globally, civil unrest is also on the rise as people from Mexico and Peru to India, Madagascar and South Africa take to the streets to demand clean water and sanitation – which is often lacking due to a mix of crumbling infrastructure, industrial pollution, poor governance and, increasingly, climate shocks such as drought and flooding.
In September 2022, police beat and arrested 25 people during protests over severe water shortages in Hamadan, Iran, where poor management, drought and corruption-ridden infrastructure projects are contributing to an existential decline in supplies. In July, a 17-year-old was killed after police in South Africa fired shots to disperse a roadblock during a protest over drinking water shortages in a small town east of Johannesburg.
“We’re seeing the effects of years of poor water resources management – due to politics, lack of financial resources, debt, corruption, conflict or other priorities – together with the effects of climate change, and this is leading to more intense competition over water resources,” said Liz Saccoccia, a water security associate at the World Resources Institute.
“Though there’s research that water can serve as a pathway to peace, we’ve seen horrible examples of the opposite this year.’
 This article was amended on 15 November 2023 to provide the revised figure of 1,200 Israeli deaths during the 7 October attacks, rather than the previously stated official figure of 1,400 deaths.

Israel faces wave of international condemnation over hospital raid,2023-11-15,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/15/turkeys-erdogan-calls-israel-terror-state-as-he-condemns-gaza-hospital-raid,"Turkey’s president calls Israel ‘terror state’ while US says it will not veto UN resolution calling for urgent humanitarian pause
Israel faced an unprecedented wave of international condemnation after its troops entered the Shifa hospital complex in Gaza, while the UN and aid agencies expressed concern about the impact of the raid on staff and patients.
The scale and virulence of the global condemnation from Arab and western governments raised questions about how much longer Israel can continue with its offensive in the face of waning international support.
The US distanced itself from the military takeover of the hospital, saying it had not authorised the Israeli decision.
The UN spoke of carnage in Gaza, and as the pressure rose during the day, Israel relented by announcing it would allow an unlimited number of aid convoys through the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border. Aid convoys have been limited to as few as 30 trucks a day when the UN said it needed hundreds to relieve starvation.
The sense of crisis engendered by the hospital takeover also led to a breakthrough at the UN in New York, where the security council passed a resolution calling for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses in fighting between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip for a “sufficient number of days” to allow humanitarian aid access.
After four unsuccessful attempts to take action last month, the US lifted its threat to veto a new resolution prepared by Malta.
The draft resolution, which emphasises the situation of children in almost every paragraph, “requires all parties to respect their obligations under international law, especially regarding the protection of civilians, particularly children”.
It also calls on Hamas to release hostages, but does not explicitly condemn the militant group’s actions.
Earlier on Wednesday, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, led the most unbridled criticism of Israel, calling for its leaders to be tried for war crimes at the international court of justice in The Hague.
“With the savagery of bombing the civilians it forced out of their homes while they are relocating, it is literally employing state terrorism,” Erdoğan said in Turkey’s parliament. “I am now saying, with my heart at ease, that Israel is a terror state.”
Turkey has withdrawn diplomats from Israel amid the country’s response to the 7 October Hamas attack.
Erdoğan’s latest comments drew a fierce response from Israel, where the opposition leader, Yair Lapid, said: “We won’t take lessons in morality from President Erdoğan, a man with an appalling human rights record. Israel is defending itself against brutal terrorists from Hamas-Isis, some of whom have been allowed to operate under Erdoğan’s roof.”
The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had earlier enraged Israel by calling on its forces to stop “killing babies”.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, insisted the west could not recourse to double standards, and said: “We condemn with the greatest firmness all bombings of civilians, in particular of civilian infrastructure which must be protected under our international law and humanitarian law.”
Up against what one Palestinian diplomat described as 1 million citizen journalists in Gaza, Israel is under pressure internationally to produce convincing evidence that the basement of the hospital was being used as a Hamas HQ, as it has claimed.
Troops had found weapons and “terror infrastructure” at one specific location within the hospital, a senior IDF official said. Hamas said the claim was a “blatant lie”. With tensions so high, Israel will struggle to be believed in some countries.
The White House said on Tuesday that it possessed intelligence to show the hospital was being used by Hamas, adding however that it did not support airstrikes on the hospital nor it being the venue for a firefight.
Israeli officials said no fighting had taken place inside the hospital since soldiers arrived during the night.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that US public support for Israel’s war is eroding and that most Americans think Israel should call a ceasefire.
When asked what role the US should play, 32% of respondents said “the US should support Israel”, down from 41% in a poll conducted on 12-13 October. Regarding a statement that “Israel should call a ceasefire and try to negotiate”, 68% of respondents said they agreed.
The UN and aid agencies expressed grave concerns about the hospital raid. “I am appalled by reports of military raid at al-Shifa hospital,” the UN humanitarian agency chief, Martin Griffiths, said on X. “The protection of newborns, patients, medical staff and all civilians must override all other concerns. Hospitals are not battlegrounds.”
The World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the agency had lost touch with staff at the hospital again. “We’re extremely worried for their and their patients’ safety,” he said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was “extremely concerned about the impact on sick and wounded people, medical staff, and civilians”.
Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, said the agency’s operation in Gaza was on the verge of collapse. “By the end of today, around 70% of the population in Gaza won’t have access to clean water,” he said.
The French foreign ministry said France was deeply concerned about the military operations at al-Shifa. “No use of civilian infrastructure for military purposes is acceptable,” it said. “The Palestinian population should not have to pay for the crimes of Hamas, and even less so the vulnerable, wounded or sick and the humanitarian workers.”
Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, urged Israel to end the “indiscriminate killing of Palestinians” in Gaza. “We demand an immediate ceasefire on the part of Israel in Gaza and strict compliance with international humanitarian law, which today is clearly not respected,” he said during a debate in parliament.
The first truck carrying a UN fuel shipment into Gaza since Israel imposed its siege crossed from Egypt on Wednesday, though it will do little to alleviate shortages that have hampered relief efforts.
The delivery was made possible by Israel giving its approval for 24,000 litres of diesel fuel to be allowed into Gaza for UN aid distribution trucks, though not for use at hospitals, according to a humanitarian source.
“This is only 9% of what we need daily to sustain life-saving activities,” Tom White, the director of the UN relief agency in Gaza, posted on X. He confirmed that just over 23,000 litres, or half a tanker, had been received.

Israel-Hamas war: Israel launches strikes on Hezbollah-linked sites in Lebanon – as it happened,2023-11-16,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/15/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-israeli-military-al-shifa-hospital-gaza-operation,"This blog has closed.

Joe Biden has presented an unapologetic defence of his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, arguing that Hamas presented a continuing threat to Israel and that Israeli forces were seeking to avoid civilian casualties. After a summit meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping, Biden told reporters:
Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again like they did before, cutting babies’ heads off, burning women and children alive. So the idea that they’re going to just stop and not do anything is not realistic.
Reports that Hamas beheaded babies in the 7 October attack on Israeli civilians remain unconfirmed, though the brutality of the massacre in which some 1,200 were killed is not in doubt.
Biden also argued that Israeli forces had switched from aerial bombardment, which he seemed to acknowledge had been “indiscriminate” in parts, to more targeted ground operations, after more than 11,000 Gazans are reported to have died. He said:
It is not carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They’re going through these tunnels, they’re going into the hospital. They’re also bringing in incubators or bringing in other means to help people in the hospital, and they’ve given, I’m told, the doctors and nurses and personnel the opportunity to get out of harm’s way. So this is a different story than I believe it was occurring before, the indiscriminate bombing.
He continued: “The IDF, Israeli Defence Forces, acknowledge they have an obligation to use as much caution as they can, in going after their targets. It’s not like they’re rushing to the hospital knocking on doors, you know, pulling people aside and shooting people indiscriminately.”
Biden also suggested that a possible hostage deal was imminent, saying the Israelis had agreed to a “pause” as part of the deal, but then stopped short, appearing to acknowledge the uneasiness of secretary of state Antony Blinken, finally adding: “I’m mildly hopeful.”
The forcefulness of Biden’s defence of the Israeli military, is notably out of step with recent remarks by senior US officials, who have shifted their emphasis to appeals to the IDF to observe humanitarian law and avoid civilian casualties. It seemed to confirm reports that the president is more unreservedly pro-Israel than many in his administration.
It’s approaching 7am in Tel Aviv and Gaza now and we’re pausing the blog here. We’ll be back soon to bring you all the latest news.
In the meantime, you can read all our coverage of the Israel-Hamas war here and our full report on Joe Biden’s defence of his refusal to call for a ceasefire here.
In the meantime, here are the latest key developments:
The United Nations security council adopted a resolution calling for humanitarian pauses in the fighting in Gaza and the establishment of aid corridors to speed relief supplies to those in need. Russia, the UK and US abstained from the vote, which passed 12-0, the first global agreement since the conflict began last month. Israel dismissed the resolution as “detached from reality”, while the the permanent observer of Palestine to the UN said the body should hold Israel accountable if it ignores it.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew from the al-Shifa hospital complex in Gaza city almost 24 hours after an overnight raid it called a “precise and targeted operation” against Hamas. The IDF said it discovered military equipment including grenades, automatic weapons, ammunition and communications technology, confirming what it said was a Hamas command operations center beneath the hospital.
Hamas denied the claim, which it said in a statement was “nothing but a continuation of the lies and cheap propaganda, through which [Israel] is trying to give justification for its crime aimed at destroying the health sector in Gaza”.
Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of the al-Shifa hospital, said that water, electricity and medical oxygen supplies were completely cut off within the facility, and that he was unable to communicate with doctors. “We cannot reach the pharmacy to treat patients as the occupation shoots everyone who moves. The smell of death wafts everywhere,” he told Al Jazeera.
Seven staff members at the Jordanian field hospital in Gaza were injured in what Jordan alleged was an Israeli airstrike on the emergency department. “Our field hospital staff rushed to the emergency section as they saw a number of Palestinians carrying wounded persons, and as our staff got to the emergency room, they got hit again,” foreign minister Ayman Safadi said, adding that “many other” Palestinians were killed or injured.
The Ministry of Health in Gaza did not update the death toll for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday, due to the collapse in communications and in hospital services in the territory, the UN humanitarian relief agency OCHA noted. As of 10 November the death toll was 11,078, of whom 4,506 were said to be children and 3,027 women. Another 27,490 Palestinians have reportedly been injured.
Eight senior politicians from the Britain’s opposition Labour Party resigned or were fired for defying leader Keir Starmer’s demand they not support a resolution in the UK parliament calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Overall, 56 Labour MPs voted for an amendment to the king’s speech brought by the Scottish National party, a major blow to the party leader’s attempts to keep unity over the war.
The US navy warship Thomas Hudner shot down a drone that emanated from Yemen in the Red Sea early on Wednesday. It was only the second time the US had brought down projectiles near its warships since the Israel-Hamas conflict began last month.
Israel’s former deputy prime minister Gideon Sa’ar told the UK publication Jewish News that his country will agree to a temporary ceasefire in Gaza to facilitate the release of hostages held by Hamas. “It will be achieved. We will see a temporary ceasefire,” he said. His words contradict those of Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has frequently and vociferously ruled out a ceasefire.
Gaza’s two main telecommunications companies warned of a “complete telecom blackout in the coming hours” in the Gaza Strip. “Main data centres and switches are gradually shutting down due to fuel depletion,” the companies said in a joint statement.
The UN children’s agency says its top official visited children and their families in the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, in the south of the territory. “What I saw and heard was devastating. They have endured repeated bombardment, loss and displacement,” Unicef’s executive director, Catherine Russell, said in a statement. “Inside the strip, there is nowhere safe for Gaza’s one million children to turn.”
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNWRA, has said: “Our entire operation is now on the verge of collapse,” and that “by the end of today, around 70% of the population in Gaza won’t have access to clean water”.
Thomas White, the director of the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), has said that water pumps and sewage treatment in the south of the Gaza Strip have stopped due to lack of fuel.
Egypt’s state-run al-Qahera television station reported on Wednesday that the first fuel truck to enter the Gaza Strip since the war started on 7 October had crossed the Egyptian gate of the Rafah crossing. It is reported to be carrying 24,000 litres. “This is not enough for anything – not for hospitals, not even for aid deliveries,” an international source familiar with the operation told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Qatari mediators were on Wednesday seeking to negotiate a deal between Hamas and Israel that includes the release of about 50 civilian hostages from Gaza in exchange for a three-day ceasefire, an official briefed on the negotiations told Reuters. The deal would also involve Israel releasing some Palestinian women and children from Israeli jails and increase the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza. Hamas has to date released four of the estimated 240 hostages seized from inside Israel’s borders on 7 October.
The family and friends of some of the 240 hostages believed to have been seized by Hamas on 7 October from inside Israel have begun the second day of their protest march from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The trip is expected to last five days and will finish at Netanyahu’s office. The families have been critical of Netanyahu’s government for not doing enough to secure the release of the hostages.
Pressure is growing on the Labor government in Australia to take a stronger line on the defence of Palestinian civilians, as backbenchers broke with the cabinet to call for a ceasefire.
The Australian government has called for “humanitarian pauses” and urged Israel to follow the rules of war and prevent civilian deaths, but has stopped short of demanding a ceasefire.
On Thursday Labor MP Maria Vamvakinou spoke out against the “humanitarian disaster that is unfolding in Gaza” and also took aim at Israel as she said that thousands of Palestinian civilians including children were “being killed by a highly sophisticated army”.
“We have to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza,” she said as she stood with the Greens to receive petitions from more than 120,000 Australians who are demanding an end to the fighting.
Here are some of the latest images coming to us from Gaza, where Israel is continuing its airstrikes, including on the south where people were told to flee by Israel.
Hundreds of demonstrators in Los Angeles shut down a stretch of Hollywood Boulevard on Wednesday afternoon in a protest demanding Joe Biden and US lawmakers call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
In the heart of Hollywood, along the palm tree-lined streets near Ripley’s Believe It or Not! and the Walk of Fame, protesters waved Palestinian flags and held signs – “not in our name” and “let Gaza live”.
More than 1,000 people gathered in the rain, including a group that staged a sit-in at the intersection with flowers in hand and shirts reading “Jews say ceasefire now” as tourists watched.
“We demand an end to the killing and the return of the hostages,” one speaker said. “Ceasefire now.”
The demonstration, organized by the groups Jewish Voices for Peace Los Angeles and IfNotNow LA, followed large gatherings around the US in Washington DC, New York and Seattle earlier in the month.
Protesters have advocated for a ceasefire in the conflict as well as an end to US military aid to Israel amid the growing death toll in the war.
Police in riot gear have used pepper spray and made arrests to try to disperse demonstrators who had gathered outside the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington on Wednesday evening to demand a ceasefire in Gaza.
Reuters reports that the demonstration was organised by three advocacy groups and took place in an area near the US Capitol building.
US Capitol Police said its officers were “working to keep back approximately 150 people who are illegally and violently protesting”.
“Officers are making arrests,” it said on X. It advised people to stay away from the area.Police used pepper spray against the demonstrators and fired projectiles containing chemical irritants, a Reuters journalist said.
Video of the demonstration posted on social media showed officers pushing protesters who had huddled together, chanting: “Let us live”. They wore black shirts reading “ceasefire now”.
A car has crashed into a barricade near the Israeli embassy in Tokyo and a man in his 50s has been arrested at the scene, Reuters reports, citing Fuji TV.
One police officer was injured, the broadcaster said.
Mark Regev, a senior advisor to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has been on various television stations in the US and UK defending Israel’s much-criticised military operation inside al-Shifa hospital.
Israel has said it found “technological equipment” – which seemed to be a laptop – as well as automatic weapons, grenades and some flak jackets at the hospital. Asked by Sky whether this was enough to prove that Hamas had its base underneath al-Shifa, Regev said that he could prove it and that:
As our forces move forward… as we succeed I have no doubt that we’ll be inviting in journalists with cameras to look at what we have in this hospital.
Hamas has said the pictures of weapons at the hospital are “cheap propaganda” and denied that its headquarters were beneath it.
Regev pointed out that the US Pentagon had also backed Israel’s claims about al-Shifa being used by Hamas, adding: “the people of Gaza know this … they can’t say so obviously because they live in an authoritarian regime … it’s the worst kept secret in Gaza”.
He also accused Hamas of a “grave crime” by using the hospital as a shield for its “war machine”.
Asked when Israel would begin providing “proper” humanitarian aid for civilians in the north, he said, “The overwhelming majority of civilians have left” adding that they had “voted with their feet” and “left the combat zone”.
By putting its military under a hospital, Hamas turned a humanitarian site into a war zone. Everyone of conscience should condemn this.Watch me on @SkyNews with @markaustintv pic.twitter.com/aHEFjXLxHv

It seemed to confirm reports that the president is more unreservedly pro-Israel than many in his administration.
US President Joe Biden has just spoken in the US, and said he had made it clear to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that a two-state solution was the only answer to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict and that occupying Gaza would be a mistake.
After meeting his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, Biden told reporters he was doing everything in his power to free hostages held by the Hamas militant group in Gaza, but that did not mean sending in the US military.
He also reiterated that the US believed like Israel that Hamas had its headquarters under the al-Shifa hospital, where the Israeli military carried out a controversial raid on Wednesday, and said that Hamas had committed war crimes.
Israel launched strikes on several Hezbollah-linked sites in Lebanon in response to an anti-tank missile that was fired towards northern Israel on Wednesday, the Israeli military (IDF) has said.
In a Telegram post early Thursday, the IDF said it had struck several Hezbollah “launch posts” including the one from which the anti-tank missile was fired as well as observation posts and other “terror infrastructure sites”.
A bit more from the OCHA statement, in which the UN agency says that the Ministry of Health in Gaza did not update the death toll for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday, due to the collapse in communications and in hospital services in the territory.
As of 10 November the death toll was 11,078, of whom 4,506 were said to be children and 3,027 women. Another 27,490 Palestinians have reportedly been injured.
The statement also noted that Palestinians fleeing northern Gaza have reported dead bodies lying in the streets and that as of 10 November, about 2,700 people including 1,500 children remain missing and are presumed to be dead or trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society has reported that it has been unable to respond to hundreds of calls to assist and evacuate people wounded or trapped under the rubble.
Gaza’s last remaining flour mill, the As Salam Mill in Deir Al Balah, was reportedly hit and destroyed on Wednesday, the UN’s humanitarian affairs office (OHCA) has said in its latest update on the conflict. It said:
This was the last functioning mill in Gaza, and its destruction means that locally produced flour will not be available in Gaza in the foreseeable future.
It noted that Gaza’s telecoms companies had also announced the “gradual cessation of all communication and internet services in the Strip” on Wednesday, as they exhausted fuel supplies to power generators. It warned:
Humanitarian agencies and first responders have warned that blackouts jeopardize the provision of life-saving assistance.
Seven staff members at the Jordanian field hospital in Gaza have been injured in what Jordan alleges was an Israeli airstrike on the emergency department.
In an interview with CNN, foreign minister Ayman Safadi said:
Our field hospital staff rushed to the emergency section as they saw a number of Palestinians carrying wounded persons, and as our staff got to the emergency room, they got hit again and about seven of our medical staff there were wounded. Many other Palestinians were unfortunately killed and injured.
Safadi said it was “incomprehensible that people trying to offer the medical help to wounded people get hit as well” and said Jordan would demand an investigation into the incident.

The Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip has said that the Israeli army deployed bulldozers at the al-Shifa hospital, where Israel launched a controversial operation on Wednesday which it said targeted Hamas.
“Israeli bulldozers destroyed parts of the southern entrance” to the hospital, the ministry said in a brief statement in Arabic early on Thursday, according to Agence France-Presse.
The Israeli army told AFP that an operation was currently underway at the hospital complex.
“Tonight we conducted a targeted operation into Shifa hospital. We continue to move forward,” Major General Yaron Finkelman, head of Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip, said on the army’s Telegram channel.
More than two dozen Palestinian cancer patients, who had crossed from Gaza into Egypt, have arrived in Turkey for treatment, Turkey’s Anadolu agency is reporting.
Two planes carrying the patients, many of them children, landed at Ankara airport shortly after 00:30 am local time on Thursday (2130 GMT Friday).
Turkey has sent a ship loaded with material for field hospitals, ambulances and generators to Egypt to treat civilians who have been able to flee Israel‘s military operation against Hamas militants in the enclave.
Agence France-Presse reports further:
Turkish health minister Fahrettin Koca said 27 patients had been flown to Turkey from Egypt, along with 13 companions, without specifying whether these were doctors or family members.
He added that the cancer patients had been able to cross from Gaza into Egypt via the Rafah border crossing.
Koca had been in Egypt for discussions on the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and said the patients were able to be transferred to Turkey thanks to “coordination between Turkey, Egypt and Israel“.
He also said that Turkey was waiting for Egypt’s permission to open its first field hospital at the Rafah crossing.
“I hope that in the near future – our efforts are going in this direction – we will be able to establish a field hospital in Gaza, in the area near the Rafah gate,” he said.
Turkey, a mostly Muslim but officially secular nation, has long championed the Palestinian cause and, more recently, has stepped up its verbal attacks against Israel for the soaring civilian toll of its military operation.
Speaking before members of his Islamic-rooted ruling party, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday called Israel “a terror state” that was committing “genocide”.
Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was escorted from a restaurant in Vancouver on Tuesday night after about 250 protesters surrounded it, police have said.
In a statement, police said almost 100 officers were deployed to disperse the protest in Chinatown and a 27-year-old man was arrested for assaulting an officer, who was punched in the face and had her eyes gouged. A 34-year-old was also arrested for obstructing police.
CBC reported that videos of the incident showed protesters shouting “ceasefire now” and waving Palestinian flags.
Trudeau angered Israel earlier on Tuesday by saying the “killing of women, of children, of babies” in Gaza must end.
Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, has called on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign, local media is reporting, saying “we can’t run an extended [military] operation with a prime minister we do not have faith in”.
In an interview with Israel’s Channel 12, Lapid did not call for an election but said the ruling Likud party should replace Netanyahu with someone from within its ranks.
Netanyahu has long been a divisive figure in Israeli politics and has been roundly criticised for allowing the 7 October attack by Hamas to happen.
In a statement, the Likud party hit back at Lapid’s comments, saying:
It is regrettable and shameful that Lapid is engaging in politics during a time of war, proposing to oust the prime minister that leads the campaign and replace him with a government that would establish a Palestinian state and would allow the Palestinian Authority to control Gaza.
A statement by Lapid’s Yesh Atid party countered by saying that the Likud has “probably missed the point,” Haaretz newspaper reported, as “Lapid proposed a government led by the Likud, with a Likud prime minister who is not Netanyahu. That is how we will begin the national healing.”

It’s 1am on Thursday in Tel Aviv and Gaza City. Here’s what we followed on Wednesday, the 40th day of the conflict between Israel and Hamas:

Pro-Palestinian student group sues DeSantis over ‘deactivation’,2023-11-16,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/16/florida-pro-palestinian-student-lawsuit-desantis-sjp,"Florida chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine say order by Republican governor violates its free speech rights
A pro-Palestinian student group in Florida is suing the state’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, and the university system for trying to “deactivate” it in a manner that violates the students’ free speech rights.
The University of Florida chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (UF SJP) filed the suit on Thursday in a federal court in Gainesville. It calls on the court to block what amounts to one of the first attempts in the US to silence a pro-Palestinian student group amid the roiling fallout of the Israel-Hamas war on American campuses.
Last month the chancellor of Florida’s university system, Raymond Rodrigues, issued a “deactivation order” targeted at UF SJP. The order, which Rodrigues said had been framed “in consultation with DeSantis”, instructed all University of Florida personnel to strip the student group of official recognition.
Rodrigues based his decision on the actions of the national entity of SJP, which he accused of engaging in “support of terrorism”. The Florida chapter insists that it has had nothing to do with the national body and its controversial statements.
In the lawsuit, UF SJP argues that it is fully autonomous and has no financial or other ties with the national body. The Florida chapter was founded in 2009 as a “human rights advocacy organization” with the mission of finding “a just and reasonable solution to the Palestine-Israel conflict”.
A spokesperson for UF SJP said that the aim of the lawsuit was to counter any official attempt to silence them or “others like us. As students on a public college campus we have every right to engage in human rights advocacy and promote public awareness and activism for a just and reasonable solution to the Palestine-Israel conflict.”
Since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October in which more than 1,200 people were killed, and the ensuing Israeli military operation inside Gaza that has so far killed more than 11,200 Palestinians, the US has seen countless rallies and demonstrations on both sides of the febrile debate. University campuses have often been a focal point.
Earlier this month Columbia University in New York suspended until the end of term its branch of SJP as well as Jewish Voice for Peace. Columbia authorities said the groups had staged unauthorised events that included “threatening rhetoric and intimidation”.
George Washington University in Washington DC has also suspended a campus chapter of SJP after it projected slogans on the wall of a library. One said: “Glory to our martyrs.”
The furor over free speech on campuses has even been injected into the 2024 presidential race. DeSantis bragged about the UF SJP clampdown at last week’s Republican presidential debate in Miami, saying: “We deactivated them. We’re not gonna use tax dollars to fund jihad.”
The dispute in Florida began on 24 October when Rodrigues sent his “deactivation order” to the leaders of all public colleges in Florida. He accused the national entity of SJP of supporting terrorism because of its response to the 7 October Hamas attack.
He pointed to a “Day of Resistance toolkit” that the national SJP group had released and comments made by the group that praised the attack as “a historic win for the Palestinian resistance”. The toolkit included a separate statement that “Palestinian students in exile are PART of this movement, not in solidarity with this movement”.
Rodrigues argued that by producing the toolkit, the national SJP group had provided material support to a “designated foreign terrorist organization” – a felony under Florida law.

But in its lawsuit, UF SJP insists that it is being unfairly tarnished by the actions of the national group. It was not involved in or consulted about the toolkit, the complaint says.
By contrast, the local chapter’s response to the Hamas attack was to “mourn the loss of innocent Palestinian and Israeli civilian life”.
UF SJP is represented in its legal action by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) , the ACLU of Florida and Palestine Legal. The suit cites two US supreme court rulings as grounds for opposing the deactivation order.
The 1972 ruling Healy v James affirmed students’ first amendment rights to speak out on matters of public concern, free from censorship. That opinion specifically stated that a college could not withhold recognition from a local chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society because of its relationship with its national sister organization – a direct mirror image of the predicament in which UF SJP now finds itself.
The second supreme court precedent, Holder v Humanitarian Law Project, found that independent advocacy is protected as free speech and cannot be criminalized. The felony of providing material support to terrorist groups only applies when there was “advocacy performed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization”.
Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU’s national security project, said: “There should be no question that independent political advocacy – no matter its viewpoint – is fully constitutionally protected.” She hoped that the legal challenge would “send a strong message that censorship in our schools is unconstitutional”.
Earlier this month the ACLU sent an open letter to the leaders of 650 colleges and universities urging them to reject calls to investigate, disband or penalize pro-Palestinian student groups for exercising free speech. Though the ACLU lamented the rise in documented threats on campuses against Jewish, Palestinian, Muslim and other students, it implored leaders not to return to the “experience of our country’s universities during the McCarthy era”.
The letter was written in the wake of an “urgent request” to universities made jointly by the Anti-Defamation League and the Brandeis Center. It urged campuses to investigate the activities of SJP for potentially supporting terrorism.

Can hospitals be military targets? What international law says,2023-11-17,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/17/can-hospitals-be-military-targets-international-law-israel-gaza-al-shifa,"Israel’s attack on Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital has sparked accusations of war crimes – but Israel says it falls within the boundaries of international law
The Geneva conventions, adopted in the aftermath of the second world war, form the core of international humanitarian law and “are particularly protective of civilian hospitals”, according to Mathilde Philip-Gay, an expert in international humanitarian law at Lyon 3 University in south-east France.
She said: “It is forbidden to turn recognised civilian hospitals into a conflict zone. It is also forbidden to use civilian populations, the sick or the injured as human shields, it is a war crime, as is fighting from inside a hospital.”
Article 8 of the Rome statute, which established the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, defines a long list of war crimes including “intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected”.
But it makes an exception if the targets are “military objectives”. Philip-Gay said that “if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used”, the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target. Nevertheless, if there is doubt as to whether a hospital is a military objective or being used for acts harmful to the enemy, the presumption, under international humanitarian law, is that it is not.
It is widely accepted that Hamas has an extensive tunnel network across Gaza.
Israel is not a member of the ICC, but the ICC says it has jurisdiction in Gaza and the West Bank because Palestine is a state party to the court, a claim Israel disputes.
Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor at the ICC, wrote in the Guardian: “For those responsible for targeting and firing missiles, I wish to be clear on three points in particular. One: in relation to every dwelling house, in relation to any school, any hospital, any church, any mosque – those places are protected, unless the protective status has been lost because they are being used for military purposes. Two: if there is a doubt that a civilian object has lost its protective status, the attacker must assume that it is protected. Three: the burden of demonstrating that this protective status is lost rests with those who fire the gun, the missile, or the rocket in question.
“In this context, I would also underline that the indiscriminate firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel may represent breaches of international humanitarian law subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC.”
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), says: “Any military operation around or within hospitals must take steps to spare and protect the patients, medical staff, and other civilians. All feasible precautions must be taken, including effective warnings, which consider the ability of patients, medical staff, and other civilians to evacuate safely.”
Philip-Gay said: “The other party must take all precautions to avoid intentionally targeting civilians.” Even if the hospital was used for “acts harmful to the enemy”, Philip-Gay said, the other party “does not have the right to bombard it for two days and completely destroy it”, citing the need under international law for the response to be “proportionate”.
She added that the other party must give advance warning of its response and that evacuation procedures must be put in place for patients and health workers.
Alternatively, they could be asked “to isolate themselves in a part of the hospital”, she said. But during any military operation against the site, “there have to be doctors to take care of the patients”.

"‘Immediate possibility of starvation’ in Gaza, UN warns | First Thing",2023-11-17,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/17/first-thing-un-agency-says-immediate-possibility-of-starvation-in-gaza,"World Food Programme says Gaza faces massive food gap, as IDF claims to have uncovered a Hamas tunnel shaft at the Shifa hospital complex. Plus: ‘forever chemical’ waste, and André 3000’s debut album
Good morning.
The UN World Food Programme warned yesterday that the Gaza Strip now faced a “massive” food gap and widespread hunger, and nearly the entire population of the Palestinian enclave was in desperate need of food assistance.
“Civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,” said the WFP executive director, Cindy McCain.
In northern Gaza, the Israeli operation in al-Shifa hospital continued, with the Israeli military saying late Thursday that it had found a Hamas tunnel shaft and “a vehicle containing a large number of weapons” at the hospital complex. Also near the hospital, the Israel Defense Forces said they had recovered the body of an Israeli hostage. Yehudit Weiss, 65, was abducted from the Be’eri kibbutz during the Hamas attack on southern Israel on 7 October that killed 1,200 people.
In southern Gaza, Israel has dropped leaflets telling Palestinian civilians to leave four towns on the eastern edge of Khan Younis, raising fears that its war against Hamas could spread to areas it previously said were safe.
The news agency AFP is reporting that a large deployment of Israeli troops raided the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank overnight. The IDF did not immediately comment.
Three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli drone strike on Jenin, the head of the Palestinian ambulance service told Reuters on Friday. It is unclear if this was part of the raid on the refugee camp.
Meanwhile, as tensions over Gaza build behind the scenes between Israel and the US, its strongest military and diplomatic ally, here’s a look at the history of Washington’s support of Israel.
The singer Cassie has filed a lawsuit against Sean Combs accusing the hip-hop icon and founder of Bad Boy Records of rape and abuse. Cassie alleges that he used his powerful network to keep her trapped in a violent relationship with him.
Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, said in a statement to the New York Times that after “years in silence and darkness”, she was “finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships”. A representative for Combs, who has gone by the names Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Diddy and Love, denied the claims, writing that the allegations were “offensive and outrageous” and came after Ventura had demanded $30m from the mogul.
The rightwing conspiracy theorist who attacked Nancy Pelosi’s husband in their San Francisco home was convicted of attempted kidnapping and assault.
Donald Trump’s trial on charges that he retained classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club is running about four months behind schedule after the federal judge presiding in the case in Florida declined to set a crucial filing deadline until at least next March.
TikTok is “proactively and aggressively” taking down videos boosting a letter written by Osama bin Laden attempting to justify the September 11 terrorist attacks, the company said on Thursday.
SpaceX has delayed its second test flight of the world’s largest rocket until Saturday, leaving expectations high for a big show after April’s launch.
New analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency found that US industry has disposed of at least 60m pounds of PFAS “forever chemical” waste over the last five years – an estimate that is likely to be a “dramatic” undercount because PFAS waste is unregulated in the US and companies are not required to record its disposal.
“These data show that we are steadily poisoning ourselves, our waters and our food chain with extremely persistent toxic chemicals,” said Tim Whitehouse, a former EPA attorney.
Abortion rights activists celebrated a huge win on 7 November when Ohio voters overwhelming voted in a constitutional amendment guaranteeing its citizens the right to abortion access. But a group of rightwing Republican lawmakers are already trying to reverse that result. “I don’t think the public should start thinking that it is going to become law,” said Mike DeWine, the Republican Ohio governor.
For most of the year, Delhi is one of the most polluted cities in the world. In this city, one in three children is already asthmatic, and many more are at risk of organ damage from breathing noxious air. “Cases have peaked since Diwali,” said Renu Das, a nursing officer. “It’s 3pm now and we’ve seen 30 children who need nebulizing since the morning. When it spikes like this, you know it’s the pollution.”
The United Arab Emirates is hosting the UN Cop28 summit later this month, and a Guardian analysis of data found that state-run oil and gas fields in the UAE have been flaring gas virtually daily despite having committed 20 years ago to a policy of zero routine flaring. The World Bank has called flaring – the burning of extracted gas that is not captured and sold – “wasteful and polluting”.
As one half of Outkast, André 3000 helped invent southern hip-hop, with hits such as Hey Ya!, So Fresh, So Clean, and Ms Jackson. His much-anticipated debut solo album is a rap-free epic of new age and ambient music for woodwind. “I’m always interested to see where I am going. I’m watching it happen, too,” André told the Guardian. “It’s not like I won’t rap ever again, but this naturally blew this way and felt worthy to share. It’s the most honest thing I can be doing.”

Israel has long wanted Palestinians out of Gaza – my father saw it firsthand | Raja Shehadeh,2023-11-20,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/20/1967-israel-gaza-palestinians-father,"Decades after the 1967 war, Israel is still under the illusion that violence against the Palestinians will give it peace and security
Fifty-six years ago, after Israel’s victory in the six-day war in 1967, an intensive debate took place in the country regarding the future of the newly occupied West Bank and Gaza. The options ranged from outright annexation of the land by Israel, returning the West Bank to Jordan or the establishment of a Palestinian state.
My father, Aziz Shehadeh, was a proponent of the last. As a lawyer and activist for refugee rights, he proposed a Palestinian state living side by side with Israel. Washington urged Israel then to translate its undefined position for a settlement into concrete terms.
In the midst of Israel’s brutal attack on Gaza, the US is again urging Israel to come up with a plan for the day after. However, as in 1967, Israel’s driving ambitions now focus on retaining as much of the land as possible and getting rid of as many Palestinians as possible.
In 1967, Israeli policymakers were adamant about keeping the occupied Gaza Strip. As early as 8 June 1967, Golda Meir, the then secretary general of ruling party Mapai, stated in a meeting of the party’s political committee that she was for “getting rid of its Arabs”. The Israeli cabinet resolution 563, of 19 June 1967, determined that “according to the international border, the Gaza Strip is located within the territory of the state of Israel”. Yet because of the large Palestinian population in Gaza, annexation of the territory, as had happened in East Jerusalem, was not a viable option.
Mass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza was also not feasible while the world was watching. So other strategies were employed. The first of these was to make life unbearable, by ruling with an iron fist and keeping the standard of living very low. The second was by encouraging emigration. Personally supervised by the prime minister, Levi Eshkol, this strategy relied on financial incentives. By mid-1968, tens of thousands had left the Strip, mostly for Jordan. But Jordan decided to stop admitting them, so Israel increased its attempts to boost emigration of Palestinians to non-Arab countries such as Brazil and other South American states, as well as Canada and Australia, but with little success. In the end, none of these strategies brought about significant results, leading Eshkol to lament, “I still don’t know how to get rid of them.”
After the passage of more than five decades, and even with the imposition of a 16-year siege of the Strip, it is clear that none of these strategies have worked and most of the Palestinian population of Gaza, composed mainly of refugees from 1948 when Israel was established, remained there and increased from 400,000 to 2.2 million. Now, with the war on Gaza, Israel seems to be seizing the opportunity to carry out what has not been possible in all the previous years.
In the wake of the 7 October killings, Israel launched a massive strike against Hamas, ostensibly to destroy its military strength, backed by sympathetic public support. But as my colleague, the human rights activist Raji Sourani, who lives in Gaza City, told me over the phone a few days ago, the war he is experiencing is not against Hamas; instead, bombs are striking locations that are heavily populated by civilians.
Events point to Israel’s strategy of emptying the north of Gaza of its Palestinian population, with both the massive bombardment that has damaged at least 222,000 residential units, and the refusal to accept a ceasefire so essential life-saving provisions cannot enter. All this shows the massive pressure on the Palestinian population to move south, thus ethnically cleansing the north. There is little prospect that this strategy is intended to keep the civilians out of harm’s way, as Israel has announced, or that it will be reversed after hostilities end. When the fighting stops there would be few buildings in the north still standing for people to move back into to restore their homes and livelihoods.
Today, almost six decades after my father’s failed effort to convince the Israeli government to make peace with the Palestinians based on sharing the land, I feel the dreadful consequences of this failure. The killing of 11,000 people by Israeli forces, the attacks taking place in the West Bank by both the Israeli army and Jewish settlers that have led to the deaths of 200 Palestinians, and the failure of the world to deter Israel’s excesses has ushered profound fear into my own life.
The cries of the man with dual Irish-Palestinian nationality who lived in Gaza’s Beach camp on the shore of the Mediterranean still ring in my ears. He said to an Al Jazeera reporter that his camp was being bombed from all sides by Israel, and he wondered whether he would survive. He was in darkness with only a torch lighting his face. He asked how much more suffering we must endure before the world stops this, then most poignantly asked the viewers: “Are you enjoying this?” I wonder whether he survived the Israeli bombings. Or another man who, after informing the reporter, “They’re bombing the camp continuously,” said, “We’re leaving our home. We’re moving to al-Shifa hospital.” He ended with the plea: “Do something. Do something.” I thought of him as the hospital was surrounded by the Israeli army.
Everything that gave me hope that when violence reaches an unconscionable point and excessive violations of human rights are committed, Israel will be made to stop, is shattered now. I used to have faith that we would be protected by international humanitarian law, or by an outcry from the Israeli public against the excesses of their government – yet at this point I see no hope in either. Nor does it seem that there is hope that Israel will wake up from the delusion that war and violence against the Palestinians and its unassailable military strength will give it peace and security. This leaves us Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories vulnerable and with serious danger for our lives and our future presence in this land.
And yet, despite it all, I find myself echoing Raji Sourani, a friend with whom I have gone through a lot over the past decades. Last week he wrote in Jacobin magazine: “We deserve justice and we deserve freedom. We believe we are on the right side of history and that we are the stones of the valley. Despite the immensity of the challenges we face, people here do not give up.”

Hamas has delivered truce response to Qatari officials – as it happened,2023-11-21,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/20/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-hostages-al-shifa-hospital-gaza-hamas-attack,"This blog is now closed.
Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh has told the Reuters news organisation that Hamas is “approaching a truce agreement”, and that the militant group has delivered its response to Qatari officials.
Qatar has been mediating with Hamas as it negotiates with Israel and the United States for the release of Israeli hostages.
This blog is now closed. We have launched a new blog at the link below – head there for the latest:
More now on what a possible truce deal is expected to include: Hamas official Izzat el Reshiq told Al Jazeera that the conditions of the truce deal will include the release of Israeli women and children from Gaza in exchange for Palestinian women and children from “occupation prisons”.
Hamas official Izzat el Reshiq has told Al Jazeera that the details of the truce would be announced by Qatar when, and as far as we know, if, it was finalised.
Hamas official Izzat el Reshiq has told Al Jazeera that the ongoing talks are for a truce that would last “a number of days” and include arrangements for the entry of aid in to Gaza, and a deal, arrangements for entry of aid into Gaza, and a swap of hostages taken by Hamas for people imprisoned by Israel.
Two sources familiar with the truce talks have told AFP a tentative deal includes a five-day truce, comprised of a ceasefire on the ground and limits to Israeli air operations over southern Gaza.
In return, between 50 and 100 prisoners held by Hamas and Islamic Jihad – a separate Palestinian militant group – would be released.
They would include Israeli civilians and captives of other nationalities, but no military personnel.
Under the proposed deal, some 300 Palestinians would be released from Israeli jails, among them women and children.
The White House said the negotiations were in the “endgame” stage, but refused to give further details, saying it could jeopardise a successful outcome.
Reuters is now translating that statement as “close to”:
Hamas officials are “close to reaching a truce agreement” with Israel and the group has delivered its response to Qatari mediators, Ismail Haniyeh said in a statement sent to Reuters by his aide.
Al Jazeera translates the Hamas statement slightly differently, saying that Hamas has said it is “close to reaching a truce agreement”.
This news is based off a statement released by Hamas, and it does not include more detail, with Reuters reporting, “there were no further details about the terms of the potential agreement”.
As we await more detail on that comment from Hamas, the Palestinian official news agency Wafa is reporting that seventeen Palestinians have been killed in Israeli bombardment of Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza which took place at midnight.
Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh has told the Reuters news organisation that Hamas is “approaching a truce agreement”, and that the militant group has delivered its response to Qatari officials.
Qatar has been mediating with Hamas as it negotiates with Israel and the United States for the release of Israeli hostages.
It is just after 4.20am in Gaza. Here is where things stand:
Israeli forces continued their offensive against Hamas in northern Gaza, closing in on the Indonesian hospital where thousands of patients and displaced people have been sheltering for weeks. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “appalled” by reports that 12 people, including patients, were killed in overnight shelling at the last hospital operating in northern Gaza. Some 200 patients have been evacuated from the Indonesian hospital on Monday, Gaza’s health ministry has said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that health services in Gaza have suffered “catastrophic” damage, with most hospitals no longer functioning. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies programme, warned that the thousands of injuries sustained by civilians across Gaza, combined with the growing public health crisis in the besieged enclave, is a “recipe for epidemics”. He also described Israel’s cooperation for humanitarian relief in Gaza as “subpar”.
The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said a clinic it operated in Gaza City was attacked on Monday morning. Part of the building was engulfed in flames, it said, and four marked MSF cars were burned while a fifth was found crushed by a heavy vehicle or a tank. The charity said it was not immediately aware of the status of one member of staff and 20 family members.
Twenty-eight premature babies were rescued from al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City and taken to Egypt on Monday. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said 31 “very sick” babies were moved from al-Shifa hospital in a joint operation with the UN and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, and 12 of them had been flown to Cairo. Three babies remain in Gaza.
Israel and Hamas appear to be edging towards a deal that would see the release of a significant number of hostages, possibly in return for a limited ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Joe Biden on Monday said he believed a deal is near, and the White House later said the US is “doing everything we can” and that it believed “we’re closer than we’ve ever been”.
Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas have clashed with far-right Israeli politicians who want to bring in the death penalty as a possible sentence for captured Hamas members. The families said on Monday that even talk of doing so might endanger the lives of their relatives. The row underlines the deep divisions in Israel over how to deal with the hostage crisis.
The UN secretary general has said it is clear that the war in Gaza has seen “a killing of civilians that is unparalleled and unprecedented in any conflict” since he began his role in 2017. At a press conference on Monday, António Guterres also said he did not believe a UN protectorate in Gaza would be a solution to the conflict and that war must “move in a determined, irreversible way to a two-state solution”.
Relief trucks originally from Jordan entered Gaza from Egypt on Monday with the intention of setting up a new field hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. Jordanian state media said it hoped the facility would help ease some of the humanitarian crisis as Israel’s forces seize medical facilities in the north.
Yemen’s Houthi rebels said they have seized what they called an Israeli cargo ship in the Red Sea, and warned that all vessels linked to Israel “will become a legitimate target for armed forces”. They have since released video footage reportedly showing armed men seizing a ship. Israel said the vessel was a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo ship.

Gaza hostage deal: what do we know?,2023-11-22,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/22/israel-hamas-war-gaza-palestine-hostages-release-deal-explained,"What has been agreed between Israel and Hamas, why has a deal been reached now, how many hostages will be freed, and what happens next?
Fifty women and children held hostage by Hamas and other groups in Gaza since 7 October are to be released in exchange for a four-day ceasefire in a deal brokered by Qatar with the support of the US.
A US official said three Americans would be among those freed, including a girl who turns four this week, and that the first release should come by Thursday.
According to Hamas, Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children, from Israeli jails and allow hundreds of aid trucks a day to cross the Rafah border with Egypt, providing humanitarian supplies to Palestinians in Gaza.
Israel will cease air sorties in southern Gaza and restrict them to six hours a day in the north, according to the Hamas account of the deal, which also says Israeli forces will not bring military vehicles into Gaza during the ceasefire, nor try to detain anyone.
The ceasefire would be extended by a day for every 10 additional hostages released, the Israeli government said.
The agreement temporarily pauses a war that has lasted more than six weeks so far. It has cost the lives of 14,128 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the government media office in Gaza, and more than 1,200 people in Israel, most of whom were victims of the surprise Hamas cross-border attack on 7 October.
Israel’s government has come under intense pressure domestically to make progress on returning hostages. Their families mounted a high-profile “bring them home” campaign, meeting members of the Israeli war cabinet on Monday night. The military assault on northern Gaza had resulted in only one hostage being rescued alive.
International pressure has also been mounting in response to the increasingly desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza. Bombing by the Israeli military followed by the ground invasion have caused a civilian crisis: food, water, fuel and medicines are desperately short, 1.7 million people out of 2.3 million have been displaced, and only 10 out of 36 hospitals are functioning.
Last week, 68% of Americans said they supported a ceasefire, reflecting concerns in the US that Israel had gone too far in its military response.
Hamas is losing ground on the battlefield, as Israel’s forces have been able to capture large parts of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. Israel’s military claims to have inflicted heavy losses on 10 out of 24 Hamas battalions and its leadership is believed to have relocated to the southern end of the Gaza Strip.
Hamas is likely to want to use any ceasefire to regroup, and it is possible it could seek to extend it by offering to gradually release more of the hostages. Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas, so its survival as a group would represent a victory.
Israel has greater motives to return to the battlefield. The Israeli military has not yet occupied all of northern Gaza. On Tuesday, it had surrounded Jabalia, which it considers a Hamas stronghold, and the nearby Indonesian hospital, the only functioning large medical facility in the north.
Israeli commanders are also focused on the south of Gaza, and in particular the city of Khan Younis, where they believe Hamas’s leadership is based and the remaining hostages may be held. Some in the Israeli military establishment argue that delivering a knockout blow to Hamas would require attacking the city, though it would kill and displace even more civilians in an already crowded country.
The US has made clear it will not support a ground offensive in the south, unless there are much greater safeguards against civilian casualties.
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, told the cabinet, in remarks that were also filmed and broadcast, that he expected fighting to restart. “We will not stop after the ceasefire,” he said.

Hopes for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and Israel | Letters ,2023-11-22,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/22/hopes-for-a-permanent-ceasefire-in-gaza-and-israel,"Readers respond to an article by Jonathan Freedland on the nature of Hamas and Benjamin Netanyahu, and to an article by Raja Shehadeh
I regularly read Jonathan Freedland’s perceptive articles and appreciate his informed perspective. May I take issue with his contention that many of those who have been advocating a ceasefire in Gaza are making mistaken assumptions that lead them to draw false and dangerous conclusions (Too many taking sides in this conflict miss the true nature of Hamas – and Netanyahu, 17 November). He claims they believe that “given all that Gaza has suffered, surely now Hamas will be deterred from future attacks”.
Israelis who have been calling for a ceasefire, I among them, harbour no such illusions about Hamas. We oppose further destruction of Gaza and the horrendous loss of life first of all, because we find it deeply immoral. Can this really be justified by Hamas’s unspeakable atrocities? And second, because these actions are counterproductive – they exacerbate the conflict, and have very likely delayed and complicated an agreement to release our hostages.
Golda Meir is reputed to have said: “We can forgive the Arabs for killing our children. We cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children.” This sentiment is sadly still so pervasive here in Israel. The population of Gaza is suffering? It’s all Hamas’s fault, they should have known what was coming to them. As if mighty Israel were merely the passive instrument of Hamas’s evil machinations. Until we accept some responsibility for our actions, the prospect for peace remains bleak. Avner GreenbergKfar Vradim, Israel
 In an otherwise informative article, it is a little difficult to believe that Jonathan Freedland is seriously suggesting that the US administration, and Israel’s other allies, are unaware that Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition are utterly opposed to a two-state solution. Tragically, a two-state solution seems beyond the current horizon, while the world is consumed with the aftermath of Hamas’s terror attack, Israel’s response, and the disagreements over calling for humanitarian pauses or a permanent ceasefire.
Regarding a ceasefire, can we look back to the precedent of 1982? Hillel Schenker, co-editor of the Palestine-Israel Journal, has made a proposal on the Times of Israel’s website, arising from years of active involvement in the struggle for peace. His proposal is for a ceasefire founded essentially on the following conditions:
(1) The exit of the Hamas leadership, perhaps to Qatar, similar to the exit of Yasser Arafat and the PLO leadership to Tunis in 1982 during the first Lebanon war.
(2) An exchange of all Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners currently held in Israeli jails.
(3) The creation of an interim international regime to rule over Gaza, organised by perhaps the US, European countries, UN agencies and Arab governments, this regime being a necessary precursor to a new Palestinian government in Gaza.Prof Stephen Ogin London
 Raja Shehadeh’s article about the failure of Israel to achieve a just peace after the six-day war (Israel has long wanted Palestinians out of Gaza – my father saw it firsthand, 20 November) fails to mention the Khartoum resolution of 1 September 1967, which emerged from a summit of all the Arab heads of state. This declared that the framework of principles governing Arab collective action would include “no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it”. This gives a clearer context than anything in his article for Israel’s belief that its continued survival required it to retain control over the extra territory it had acquired in 1967.

Wednesday briefing: What’s ‘on the table’ for Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement,2023-11-22,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/22/first-edition-autumn-statement-tax-cuts,"In today’s newsletter: Amid backbench pressure to cut taxes, Rishi Sunak and his chancellor have signalled a willingness to bring forward tax cuts
 Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition
Good morning.
In a few hours, Jeremy Hunt will deliver the autumn statement, and because the UK is on track to borrow less than expected, the chancellor has more room to play with than initially anticipated. So, despite months of insistence from both the chancellor and the prime minister that there will be no tax cuts for fear that there would be inflationary consequences, Hunt has hinted rather coyly in interviews that “everything is on the table”, leaving many to predict that some kind of tax cut is on the horizon.
But where will that fall – and who will it benefit most?
The central message that Hunt will try to hammer home is that the Conservative party is the party of economic growth, despite the stagnation that has characterised Britain’s economy for the past decade. As the next general election approaches, this will be one of the last opportunities for the chancellor to make a big splash as the Conservatives attempt to claw back their polling deficit.
For today’s newsletter, I spoke with the Guardian’s economics correspondent, Richard Partington, about what to expect and the stakes for a government trailing by double digits in the polls. That’s right after the headlines.
Gaza | Israel and Hamas overnight agreed a deal for the release of 50 women and children held hostage in Gaza in return for a four-day partial ceasefire, the Israeli government has announced. It did not say when the ceasefire would start, but the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the first hostages should be free within 48 hours. Israel said there would be an extra day’s pause for every 10 more hostages freed. To keep up to date with this story, read the Guardian’s live blog. This explainer has more information on the situation.
Wales | The bodies of four teenage boys, who disappeared after travelling to north Wales for a camping trip, have been found inside an overturned and partly submerged car. Police made the find on Tuesday about five miles from where Jevon Hirst, Harvey Owen, Wilf Henderson and Hugo Morris were last seen in Porthmadog two days earlier.
Business | Tax officials are understood to be examining whether David Cameron failed to fully disclose taxable perks such as flights on private planes when he worked for the collapsed lender Greensill Capital, the Guardian can reveal.
Climate | Private jets belonging to 200 celebrities, CEOs, oligarchs and billionaires have spent a combined total of 11 years in the air since the start of 2022, the equivalent of the total emissions of almost 40,000 Britons. The Guardian used public data to track flights by private aircraft owned by celebrities and businesspeople including Elon Musk, the Rolling Stones, the Murdoch family and Kylie Jenner over 21 months.
Tech | Sam Altman is set to make a return as chief executive of OpenAI after the ChatGPT developer said it had “reached an agreement in principle” for his reinstatement. The company made the announcement after days of corporate drama in the wake of Altman’s surprise sacking on Friday. Nearly all of OpenAI’s workforce has threatened to quit unless the board overseeing the business brought back Altman and then quit immediately afterwards.
Following hints dropped by Jeremy Hunt over the weekend about potential tax cuts, there has been a lot of speculation about what exactly could be on the table.
Initially, headlines focused on inheritance tax, a “totemic” issue for the Conservatives, Richard says. As a policy, raising the level at which it is paid – or scrapping it entirely – would not cost the government a lot, nor would it be inflationary, but the government appears to have had second thoughts about putting money into an area that would disproportionately benefit the richest. It may also be something they wait until the spring to announce: “That would give them more time to see how the economy performs,” says Richard. “They also might want to announce things closer to the next election to give them the most bang for their buck.”
In terms of other personal tax cuts, many people will be closely watching news surrounding income tax and national insurance. A 1% cut to income tax would cost the government £6.5bn, which is a decent chunk of the £17bn windfall from reduced borrowing, but still relatively affordable.
On the face of it, this could be a popular policy choice, however Richard says that it’s important to note that there are large increases in taxes happening by policies that are already in place. The six year freeze on income tax thresholds is estimated to raise over £50bn, as inflation drags millions of people into paying income tax for the first time. “So even if they announced a 1% cut in income tax, economists expect that overall people will still be paying more tax,” Richard adds. Other things to look out for include stamp duty reforms and business tax cuts.
Why has the government changed its tune on tax cuts?
There is a clear political incentive for the chancellor: many backbench MPs have been calling for tax cuts, frustrated that a Conservative government has overseen the highest tax levels since records began 70 years ago. Lower taxes are a “classic part of conservative ideology”, Richard says, and given that Sunak has been under significant pressure from those within his own party to revitalise the Tories’ performance, it would seem like a simple place to start. “They see [tax cuts] as one way to try and turn around their chances at a general election next year,” Richard adds.
Sunak has also hit his target to halve inflation (as he has told anyone who will listen). Inflation now sits at around 4.6% (largely thanks to falling energy prices), and the government believes it can move from stabilising the economy into the next stage of growth and tax cuts. “They’ve always been concerned that the tax cuts would be inflationary because when you put more money into people’s pockets, they have more money to spend and that can lead to inflation,” Richard explains.
The other reason is more obvious: public finances performed more strongly this year than expected, with government borrowing around £17bn lower than was anticipated in March. As a result, Hunt could have as much as £25bn to spend, up from £6.5bn in the spring, according to one economic consultant. All of these factors combined have meant that “the government sees an economic rationale for cutting taxes”, Richard says.
What about benefits and pensions?
Welfare recipients could be impacted by today’s statement, if the chancellor decides to increase benefits by a lower amount next year. Traditionally, the treasury increases the value of benefits each year using inflation data from September, which was 6.7% this year. However there has been a lot of speculation that the government could use October’s inflation data, which, at 4.6%, was considerably lower and would save the government billions. Richard predicts that the government might not go through with this as it could be politically damaging: “They wouldn’t want to walk into an election year being portrayed as the nasty party that cuts taxes for the rich and targets poor people,” Richard says.
According to analysis by Philip Inman, Hunt could also save £600m on next year’s triple lock pension by changing the calculation and excluding bonuses.
It’s all to play for …
Everyone is seeing this statement through the lens of an upcoming election. This is one of the last opportunities to set up an economic plan before voters go to the polls, so if Hunt does not make any big swings, it likely means that he is saving his biggest announcements for the spring budget, which hints at an election late in 2024.
After the failure of one of the government’s flagship policies in the supreme court last week, Hunt will be trying to strike a tone that shows stability and leadership: “It’s going to be about growing the economy, encouraging more people to work and encouraging businesses to invest in the UK,” Richard says. Lets see if it pays off.

A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad
In a bid to counter the loneliness that descends with Scandinavia’s dark winter months, the northern Swedish city of Luleå has launched a campaign to ease social isolation by encouraging people to say hello to one another. The Säg hej! (say hello!) campaign says it aims to create a friendlier city by nudging people towards small but significant social interactions.
Åsa Koski, who came up with the idea for the campaign, says being greeted by strangers makes people feel “more seen and a bit more like you belong”. “Research shows that it has an effect on health and often an effect on wanting to help each other. If you say hi to your neighbours you are more likely to help them.”

Israeli cabinet approves deal for pause in fighting – as it happened,2023-11-22,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/21/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-leader-haniyeh-truce-ceasefire-talks-gaza-qatar-latest-news,"This blog is now closed. Follow the latest news and updates from the Israel-Hamas war in our new live blog here.
Reuters reports that the Israeli Prime Minister’s office has announced that the deal, which has been approved by the cabinet, will see the release of 50 hostages, women and children, over four days, during which there will be pause in fighting. Groups of 12-13 hostages will be released per day, the Times of Israel reports.
The Times of Israel also reports that there may be 30 more hostages released and that the pause in fighting could be extended “by a day for each group of 10 more Israeli hostages”.
Earlier, Israeli media, including Channel 12 news, reported that if the deal was approved, the first release of hostages is expected on Thursday.
The delay is because if the deal is agreed to, there must be a 24-hour waiting period before it is implemented, to give Israeli citizens the chance to ask the Supreme Court to block the release of Palestinian prisoners, according to reports in Israeli media.
This blog is closing now. Head to the link below for the latest:
The senior US official also said Hamas needed the pause in fighting in order to locate some of the hostages, meaning they may be able to identify and collect additional women and children to be released.
They also said a rigorous inspection regime would ensure the militant group did not use the pause to get more weapons, according to Reuters.
Officials hope the pause in fighting will also be observed in northern Israel where there have been clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces.
The total number of hostages freed could rise, a senior US official has said.
“The deal has ultimately been structured to incentivise releases beyond 50,” the official said adding that the agreement “is now structured for women and children in the first phase, but with an expectation for further releases.”
The Israeli military will remain “vigilant” during the truce, spokesman Jonathan Conricus has said, adding that it will “use the time to prepare for future operations”.
He said:
After the hostage deal is implemented, we will continue dismantling Hamas while respecting humanitarian law on the ground.
Hamas will release 50 women and children under the age of 19 in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons, the militant group has said in a statement, according to Reuters.
The statement said the two sides had agreed to stop all fighting for four days and that Israel had agreed not to attack or arrest anyone in Gaza during that period.
Air traffic would stop completely in southern Gaza during the four days and for daily six-hour periods in the north, Hamas said.
Hundreds of trucks would be allowed in carrying humanitarian aid to all areas of Gaza, it continued.
Here’s our full report on the hostage deal:
Israel and Hamas have agreed a deal for the release of 50 women and children hostages held in Gaza in return for a four-day partial ceasefire, the Israeli government announced early on Wednesday.
The announcement from the prime minister’s office said the lull in Israeli military operations would be extended for an additional day for every 10 more hostages released. It did not say when the ceasefire would start, though in his address to his cabinet, Benjamin Netanyahu said the first hostages should be free within 48 hours of the agreement.
Hamas confirmed an agreement had been reached and added that 150 Palestinian women and children would be freed from Israeli jails.
“The Israeli government is committed to the return of all abductees home,” the government statement said in a WhatsApp message. “Tonight, the government approved the outline for the first stage of achieving this goal, according to which at least 50 abductees — women and children — will be released for four days, during which there will be a lull in the fighting. The release of every 10 additional abductees will result in an additional day of respite.”
Three Americans held by Hamas in Gaza are expected to be among at least 50 hostages to be released by the Islamist Palestinian group under the deal arranged with Israel, the US and Qatar, a senior US official said according to Reuters.
The three include a 3-year-old girl whose parents were among the more than 1,200 people killed in Hamas’ initial 7 October attack on southern Israel, the official said.
The official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said it was likely that more than 50 hostages, largely women and children, will be released once a pause in fighting takes hold.
The hostage group will include two American women and an American girl named Abigail who will turn four on Friday, the official said.
Initial releases of hostages are expected within 24 hours of the deal’s announcement, with the first likely to be freed Thursday morning, the official said.
“I would say it’s at least 50 of the women and children over a period of four to five days,” the official said, without providing details of any other nationalities expected to be released.
Here is what we know about the hostage deal approved by Israel’s cabinet:
The Israeli Prime Minister’s office announced that Israel’s cabinet has voted to approve a deal that will see the release of 50 hostages, who are women and children, over four days, during which there will be pause in fighting in Gaza. 
A government statement on the deal said, “The Government of Israel is obligated to return home all of the hostages. Tonight, the Government has approved the outline of the first stage of achieving this goal, according to which at least 50 hostages – women and children – will be released over four days, during which a pause in the fighting will be held. The release of every additional ten hostages will result in one additional day in the pause.”
The deal cannot be enacted until Thursday to allow time for Israeli judges to review potential legal challenges to the release of prisoners, the New York Times and reports, citing Israeli officials.
Groups of 12-13 hostages will be released per day, the Times of Israel reports, and fighting may be paused for more days if more hostages are released.
Israel believes Hamas could potentially locate some 30 more Israeli mothers and children beyond the initial 50, the Times of Israel reports, and that the halt in fighting could be extended by a day for each group of 10 more Israeli hostages who are located and freed, the government official said. “Hamas is claiming it cannot immediately track down around 10 children taken from Israel during the shock October 7 attack,” the Times of Israel reports.
Axios reports that the deal also includes an agreement by Israel to allow “around 300 aid trucks per day to enter Gaza from Egypt” as well as additional fuel.
Only three cabinet ministers opposed the deal, Axios and Al Jazeera report. The ministers opposed each belong to the Religious Zionism Party.

Israel-Hamas war: son of senior Hezbollah lawmaker killed in strike on Lebanon border – as it happened,2023-11-23,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/22/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-hostage-deal-release-ceasefire-pause-latest-news,"This blog has now closed. You can read our full report on the latest news here
A senior Israeli official has said that the planned exchange of some Palestinians held in Israeli prisons for Israeli hostages in Hamas has been delayed until at least Friday.
In a statement, Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said:
The release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday.
It’s just after 6.30am in Tel Aviv and Gaza and we’re pausing the blog here. We’ll be back soon with all the latest news. In the meantime, here are the key developments:
Israeli officials said that the ceasefire and hostage deal will not come into effect until Friday at the earliest, dashing the hopes of families who had hoped to see loved ones earlier. In a statement released on Wednesday night, Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said talks on the deal were continuing and that the hostage release “will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday.”
Multiple news outlets later cited anonymous Israeli officials as saying that the halt in fighting would also not begin on Thursday, as had been widely expected. Israel’s public broadcaster Kan, citing an unidentified Israeli official, reported there was a 24-hour delay because the agreement was not signed by Hamas and mediator Qatar. The official said they were optimistic the agreement would be carried out once it was signed.
Under the agreement, Hamas will free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages they took on 7 October. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.
The deal, struck after lengthy and complex talks mediated by Qatar, the US and Egypt, comes more than six weeks after the conflict began on 7 October, when Hamas launched attacks from Gaza into southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 240 people hostage. The Israeli offensive has killed between 13,000 and 14,000 people, thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has warned that “the war continues” despite the deal for a temporary ceasefire and release of some hostages. At a briefing on Wednesday, he also said part of the deal with Hamas stipulates that representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will be allowed to visit the hostages that remain in Gaza after some of them are returned. The ICRC earlier on Wednesday said it had “not been made aware of any agreement…related to visits by the ICRC to the hostages”.
A coalition of aid agencies have warned that the four-day ceasefire left almost no time to provide effective humanitarian relief to Gaza’s 2.3 million people. In a briefing on Wednesday, they argued the only effective response would be a permanent or durable end to the war and that it remained unclear if there would be sufficient access, particularly to the north of the strip, to allow anything beyond cursory relief.
Palestinian and Israeli officials have published the names of 300 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons, at least some of whom are expected to be released in an exchange with Hamas in Gaza for dozens of Israeli hostages seized by the militant group on 7 October.
The families of hostages held in Gaza have said they are living in a “nightmare” as they endure an agonising wait to see if their loves ones are among those freed. The relatives of some of the 240 hostages in Gaza have said they were in the dark about who would be released and when. Meanwhile, excitement is also growing for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank that their imprisoned loved ones may also be coming home.
More than 100 Palestinians in Gaza – including 50 from one family – were reported killed on Wednesday as Israeli forces continued attacking across the strip from land, sea and air. Wafa, a Palestinian news agency, said 81 people had been killed since midnight as houses were targeted in the centre of the strip. A further 60 were believed to be dead after bombing in and around the Jabaliya refugee camp in the north.
The head of the UN children’s agency (Unicef) has called the Gaza Strip “the most dangerous place in the world to be a child” and said that the temporary ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is “far from enough”. Catherine Russell, addressing the UN security council on Wednesday, also said that “all children inside the territory” were facing “what could soon become a catastrophic nutrition crisis”.
The number of journalists killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict since 7 October has increased to at least 53, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). The funerals were held in Beirut on Wednesday for Al Mayadeen’s reporter Farah Omar and camera operator Rabih al Mamari who were both killed by an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday.
Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement officially confirmed that five of its fighters, including the son of a senior lawmaker, have been killed, amid skirmishes at the Israel-Lebanon border, according to AFP. Abbas Raad, son of the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc Mohammed Raad, was “martyred on the road to Jerusalem”, the group said in a statement – the phrase it has been using to announce the death of its members due to Israeli fire since the war started on 7 October.
Israel’s military has said it intercepted a cruise missile near the southern port city of Eilat. Eilat is in the south of Israel at the northern tip of the Red Sea, and has previously been targeted during the conflict both by long range fire from the Gaza Strip and by Yemen’s Houthi forces.
The western powers on the UN security council face a choice of either demanding Israel lift its stranglehold on humanitarian aid into Gaza or being complicit in Israeli war crimes and collective punishment, foreign ministers from Arab and Muslim countries said on a visit to London on Wednesday.
Pope Francis has faced criticism for allegedly drawing equivalence between Israel and Hamas. During a general audience after meeting with Israeli and Palestinian delegations at the Vatican, the pope reportedly remarked: “They suffer so much, I heard how they both suffer.” He went on: “Wars do this, but here we have gone beyond war: this is not war, it is terrorism.”
US Central Command says one of its destroyers shot down multiple drones launched from Houthi controlled areas of Yemen early on Thursday.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, central command said the drones were shot down “while the US warship was on patrol in the Red Sea”. No damage or injuries were reported to the ship or its crew.
Houthi rebels seized a cargo ship in the Red Sea earlier this week and have previously launched drones that were also shot down by US forces.
On the morning (Yemen time) of November 23, the USS Thomas Hudner (DDG 116) shot down multiple one-way attack drones launched from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen.

There’s been a lot of controversy over pro-Palestine marches in the UK. Here’s a piece by Daniel Boffey our chief reporter:
No 10 should not implement plans to amend the law on glorifying terrorism after the pro-Palestine marches as it would do “no favours” to police, MI5 or the probation service, a government adviser has said.
In a 15-page report submitted to the Home Office, Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said there was no need to respond to the marches with new terrorism legislation, adding that there was “good reason for caution” given both the risk of unintended consequences and the drain on limited state resources.
Ministers have said they want to tighten the law on glorifying terrorism after the conduct of a minority of people on the pro-Palestine demonstrations in recent weeks, including the chanting of the controversial slogan “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, prompted calls for change.
Some view the words as antisemitic and as encouraging the destruction of Israel.
Here’s some more analysis from our correspondents Julian Borger in Washington, Jason Burke in Jerusalem, and Ruth Michaelson in Istanbul on how the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement came about:
The hostage deal that was finally agreed by the Israeli cabinet in the early hours of Wednesday was very similar in outline to what was on the table a month ago, according to sources familiar with the discussions.
In the intervening weeks, a lot has happened to turn the proposal to exchange women and children prisoners during a ceasefire into a near-reality.
Israel has mounted a ground offensive, seizing control of much of northern Gaza, and sending Hamas underground. The Israeli Defense Forces are now open to a tactical pause while decisions are made about how to move southwards.
Meanwhile, the government of Benjamin Netanyahu has been under acute and mounting pincer pressure: from the Biden administration, and internally from the hostages’ families and their sympathisers, who have waged a relentless public campaign to put the captives’ lives first.

Various news agencies have been taken on tours of al-Shifa hospital with the Israel Defence Forces.
Since Israel declared war against Hamas following its attack on 7 October, it has repeatedly accused the Islamic militant group of using Gaza’s hospitals as cover. It has paid special attention to al-Shifa, Gaza’s largest hospital, saying Hamas has hidden command centres and bunkers underneath the hospital’s sprawling grounds.
Associated Press has described how it was allowed access to Gaza on the condition that its journalist stay with the Israeli military convoy throughout the four-hour tour and submit all material to a military censor ahead of publication. It says there is no other way for foreign journalists to currently access the enclave.
The agency wrote that on the reporting trip the Israeli military unveiled what it claimed was a Hamas military facility under al-Shifa, showing to a group of foreign journalists what appears to be a subterranean dormitory. The news agency writes:
Dozens of soldiers escorted journalists through a narrow stone tunnel – which the military said stretched 150 meters (164 yards) to a series of underground bunkers beneath Shifa hospital in Gaza City.
The living quarters, located at the end of the tunnel, had an air conditioner, kitchen, bathroom and pair of metal cots in a room fashioned from rusty white tile. They appeared to be out of use.
Here is a picture from Reuters. The news agency explains that its images were reviewed by the IDF too as part of the conditions of the embed – but no photos were removed.
This picture from AFP was also taken during a controlled tour in Gaza and edited under the supervision of the Israeli military, according to the news agency.
The western powers on the UN security council face a choice of either demanding Israel lift its stranglehold on humanitarian aid into Gaza or being complicit in Israeli war crimes and collective punishment, foreign ministers from Arab and Muslim countries said on a visit to London on Wednesday.
The ministers are lobbying the five permanent members of the security council – China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US – to back a humanitarian resolution instructing Israel to allow UN agencies, and not the Israel Defense Forces, to check aid going through the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza.
They say the proposal is in line with practice in Syria, and reflects their concern that Israel is determined to depopulate Gaza slowly by making it uninhabitable.
The call came as the head of Unicef, Catherine Russell, told the UN security council that the Gaza Strip was now “the most dangerous place on earth to be a child”, adding that four-day humanitarian pauses were not sufficient to “put a stop to this carnage”. A consortium of aid agencies also questioned what could be delivered to Gaza during the truce, due to start on Thursday.
The group of foreign ministers, from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Turkey, Nigeria and Palestine, were in London for talks with the foreign secretary, David Cameron, before seeing the French president, Emmanuel Macron, later on Wednesday. They had already been to Beijing and Moscow.
A prestigious journal published by Harvard Law School has been accused of censorship after it refused to publish an academic article accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, allegedly because editors feared a backlash.
The Harvard Law Review, which is run by the school’s student body, declined the 2,000-word essay – titled The Ongoing Nakba: Towards a Legal Framework for Palestine – by a Palestinian doctoral candidate, Rabea Eghbariah, after it had been edited, fact-checked and initially approved.
The article, commissioned after Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, followed by an Israeli assault on Gaza, would have been the first by a Palestinian scholar ever published by the review. The Intercept originally broke the story.
It argued that events in Gaza – where more than 14,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its military offensive – met the terms of genocide as defined by the United Nations convention. The article also called for a legally recognised crime of “Nakba” (catastrophe), the Arab word used to describe the forced removal of Palestinians from their homes at the time of Israel’s founding in 1948.
Here are some of the most recent images coming to us from Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Israel has been carrying out strikes on the south throughout the conflict, despite telling Palestinians to flee there for safety.
Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement has officially confirmed that five of its fighters, including the son of a senior lawmaker, have been killed, amid skirmishes at the Israel-Lebanon border, according to AFP.
Abbas Raad, son of the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc Mohammed Raad, was “martyred on the road to Jerusalem”, the group said in a statement – the phrase it has been using to announce the death of its members due to Israeli fire since the war started on 7 October.
It issued separate statements with the identities and photographs of four other fighters who were also killed.
As we reported earlier, a source close to the family said that Abbas Raad “was killed with a number of other Hezbollah members” in an Israeli strike Wednesday on a house in south Lebanon’s Beit Yahun.
Since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, the frontier between Lebanon and Israel has seen escalating exchanges of fire, mainly between Israel and Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah, but also Palestinian groups, raising fears of a broader conflagration.
Israel’s army said in statements Wednesday evening that it had struck a number of Hezbollah targets and sources of fire from Lebanon, including a Hezbollah “terrorist cell” and infrastructure.
Since the cross-border exchanges began, 107 people have been killed on the Lebanese side, according to an AFP tally. At least 75 are Hezbollah fighters but the toll also included at least 14 civilians, three of them journalists.
Seven Hezbollah fighters have also been killed in Syria.
On the Israeli side, six soldiers and three civilians have been killed, according to authorities.
The strike came just hours after the four-day truce in Gaza was announced between Israel and Hamas, which is a Hezbollah ally.
Iran’s foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who visited Beirut on Wednesday, warned in an interview that if the Hamas-Israel ceasefire begins but “does not continue... the conditions in the region will not remain the same as before the ceasefire and the scope of the war will expand”.
A bit more on the delay to the ceasefire and hostage release courtesy of Reuters, which notes that neither side had announced time for either event, though an Egyptian security source told the new agency that mediators had sought a start time of 10am on Thursday. Reuters reports further:
Israel’s public broadcaster Kan, citing an unidentified Israeli official, reported there was a 24-hour delay because the agreement was not signed by Hamas and mediator Qatar.
The official said they were optimistic the agreement would be carried out when it was signed.
“No one said there would be a release tomorrow except the media ... We had to make it clear that no release is planned before Friday, because of the uncertainty that hostages’ families are facing,” Kan quoted a source in Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office as saying.
US secretary of state Antony Blinken has also been on the telephone, talking to his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, in which the pair reaffirmed their commitment to preventing the further spread of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the State Department said according to Reuters.
Blinken also welcomed Saudi Arabia’s efforts to secure a durable peace agreement in Yemen, the state department said.
There have been fears of a regional overspill, as violence has broken out along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and US forces have been attacked in Iraq and Syria. Washington has blamed those attacks on groups backed by Iran.
This week Yemen’s Houthi rebels also seized a cargo ship in the Red Sea.
US President Joe Biden also spoke with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani, to thank him for his “personal” role in reaching the hostage and ceasefire agreement, the White House said in a statement. It said:
The two leaders committed to remain in close contact to ensure the deal is fully implemented and to ultimately secure the release of all hostages.
They reiterated the importance of protecting civilian lives, respecting international humanitarian law, and increasing and sustaining humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza.
Qatar, where the political leadership of Hamas is based, played a key role in the negotiations. For more about its role check out our explainer:
US President Joe Biden has said that “under no circumstances will the United States permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, or the besiegement of Gaza, or the redrawing of the borders of Gaza,” in a phone call with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the White House said in another statement. It continued:
He [Biden] also affirmed that under no circumstances can Gaza remain a sanctuary for Hamas where they can threaten Israel and Palestinians alike and imperil any pathway to a durable peace.
The President affirmed his commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state and recognized Egypt’s essential role in setting the conditions for that outcome.
Multiple news media are reporting that the ceasefire will also be delayed, as well as the hostage deal.
An Israeli source told Israeli newspaper Haaretz that there would be no halt to the fighting in Gaza as long as there is no finalised timeline for the agreement with Hamas.
The BBC also reported that an Israeli government source said there would be a delay to the ceasefire, which had been expected to begin at 10am (0800GMT) on Thursday with the release of hostages expected to begin shortly after.
An Israeli official meanwhile told the news agency AFP early Thursday there would be no halt in the fighting between Israel and Hamas “before Friday”.
The reports come shortly after Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said late Wednesday that none of the hostages seized in the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7 would be freed before Friday.
US President Joe Biden “emphasized the importance of maintaining calm along the Lebanese border as well as in the West Bank”, in a phone call with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in which he welcomed the hostage deal, the White House has said.
In a statement, the White House said the two leaders discussed the pause in fighting, which “will allow for surging in much needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza”. It continued:
The Prime Minister thanked the President for his tireless efforts, and those of his team, to help broker this deal. The two leaders agreed that the work is not yet done and the President assured the Prime Minister that he will continue working to secure the release of all remaining hostages.

It’s 1am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
A senior Israeli official has said that the planned exchange of some Palestinians held in Israeli prisons for Israeli hostages in Hamas has been delayed until at least Friday. In a statement released on Wednesday night, Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said talks on the deal were continuing and that the release “will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday.”
The first ceasefire in seven weeks of war in Gaza is due to come into effect on Thursday morning, officials from both Hamas and Israel have said. A four-day truce was announced early on Wednesday after days of feverish speculation and intense negotiations. Under the agreement, Hamas will free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages they took on 7 October. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials. It is not thought that the reported delay in the release of hostages will impact the ceasefire start time.
The deal, struck after lengthy and complex talks mediated by Qatar, the US and Egypt, comes more than six weeks after the conflict began on 7 October, when Hamas launched attacks from Gaza into southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 240 people hostage. The Israeli offensive has killed between 13,000 and 14,000 people, thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has warned that “the war continues” despite the deal for a temporary ceasefire and release of some hostages. At a briefing on Wednesday, he also said part of the deal with Hamas stipulates that representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will be allowed to visit the hostages that remain in Gaza after some of them are returned. The ICRC earlier on Wednesday said it had “not been made aware of any agreement…related to visits by the ICRC to the hostages”.
A coalition of aid agencies have warned that the four-day ceasefire left almost no time to provide effective humanitarian relief to Gaza’s 2.3 million people. In a briefing on Wednesday, they argued the only effective response would be a permanent or durable end to the war and that it remained unclear if there would be sufficient access, particularly to the north of the strip, to allow anything beyond cursory relief.
Palestinian and Israeli officials have published the names of 300 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons, at least some of whom are expected to be released in an exchange with Hamas in Gaza for dozens of Israeli hostages seized by the militant group on 7 October. An initial 10 hostages – children or elderly women – are expected to be released on Thursday morning.
The families of hostages held in Gaza have said they are living in a “nightmare” as they endure an agonising wait to see if their loves ones are among those freed. The relatives of some of the 240 hostages in Gaza have said they were in the dark about who would be released and when. Meanwhile, excitement is also growing for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank that their imprisoned loved ones may also be coming home.
More than 100 Palestinians in Gaza – including 50 from one family – were reported killed on Wednesday as Israeli forces continued attacking across the strip from land, sea and air. Wafa, a Palestinian news agency, said 81 people had been killed since midnight as houses were targeted in the centre of the strip. A further 60 were believed to be dead after bombing in and around the Jabaliya refugee camp in the north.
The head of the UN children’s agency (Unicef) has called the Gaza Strip “the most dangerous place in the world to be a child” and said that the temporary ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is “far from enough”. Catherine Russell, addressing the UN security council on Wednesday, also said that “all children inside the territory” were facing “what could soon become a catastrophic nutrition crisis”.
The number of journalists killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict since 7 October has increased to at least 53, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). The funerals were held in Beirut on Wednesday for Al Mayadeen’s reporter Farah Omar and camera operator Rabih al Mamari who were both killed by an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has managed to avert a wider rebellion over the Gaza deal with Hamas among his far-right coalition partners even as Itamar Ben-Gvir, the firebrand national security minister, called it immoral.
Israel’s military has said it intercepted a cruise missile near the southern port city of Eilat. Eilat is in the south of Israel at the northern tip of the Red Sea, and has previously been targeted during the conflict both by long range fire from the Gaza Strip and by Yemen’s Houthi forces.
The western powers on the UN security council face a choice of either demanding Israel lift its stranglehold on humanitarian aid into Gaza or being complicit in Israeli war crimes and collective punishment, foreign ministers from Arab and Muslim countries said on a visit to London on Wednesday.
Pope Francis has faced criticism for allegedly drawing equivalence between Israel and Hamas. During a general audience after meeting with Israeli and Palestinian delegations at the Vatican, the pope reportedly remarked: “They suffer so much, I heard how they both suffer.” He went on: “Wars do this, but here we have gone beyond war: this is not war, it is terrorism.”
There are reports that the son of a senior Hezbollah lawmaker was killed in an Israeli strike in south Lebanon on Wednesday.
Abbas Raad, son of the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc Mohammed Raad, “was killed with a number of other Hezbollah members” in an Israeli strike on a house in Beit Yahun, a source close to the family told AFP.
The official Lebanese government’s news agency reported that “an air strike launched by the Israeli enemy ... on a house in Beit Yahun killed four people”, and wounded others. It did not identify the victims.
In a statement, the Israeli military said its fighter jets struck Hezbollah infrastructure in Lebanon, and that its troops and aircraft hit two cells that fired at Israeli troops or attempted to launch rockets into Israel, Haaretz reported.

Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said the military will resume fighting against Hamas “with intensity” for at least two more months once the “short” temporary pause ends.
Gallant, addressing troops of the Israeli navy special operations unit on Thursday, was quoted by the Times of Israel as saying:
What you will see in the coming days is first the release of hostages. This respite will be short.
He told troops to “organise, get ready, investigate, resupply arms, and get ready to continue” during the ceasefire, adding:
There will be a continuation, because we need to complete the victory and create the impetus for the next groups of hostages, who will only come back as a result of pressure.
“At least another two months of fighting is expected,” he added.
From the Times of Israel’s Emanuel Fabian:

Here are some of the latest images coming to us over the wires from Gaza.
Here’s a recap of the latest developments, and our latest full report is here.
A four-day ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas will begin at 7am local time on Friday (0500 GMT), Majed al-Ansari, the spokesperson for the foreign ministry of Qatar, has announced. The truce, initially lasting four or five days, was announced early on Wednesday and has raised hopes for a more durable pause in the violence.
The release of hostages is expected to follow on Friday afternoon. Israel and Hamas have exchanged lists of those to be released, with Hamas expected to free 13 women and children, Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Ansari said. He did not specify how many Palestinian women and children will be released on Friday or when this would take place. Israel has notified the families of the hostages set to be released on Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said. Joe Biden said he has his “fingers crossed” that a three-year-old Israeli-American girl will be released.
Overall, Hamas has agreed to free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages it has held since launching bloody attacks into southern Israel on 7 October, under the terms of the agreement. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.
In a separate agreement, Hamas is set to unconditionally release 23 Thai hostages it is holding in Gaza, according to a report by the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news site. The release of Thai hostages came after Iran-mediated talks, the outlet reported on Thursday.
A special flight has evacuated 103 Russian nationals from Gaza, Russia’s emergencies ministry said early on Friday. In a post on Telegram, the ministry said the group flew to Moscow aboard a chartered Ilyushin-76 aircraft, Reuters reported. The post said 101 Russian nationals had been taken from Gaza to Egypt in the past 24 hours, bringing to more than 750 the total number of Russian evacuees. More than 650 had been flown to Russia, including more than 300 children.
The exchange of Palestinian and Israeli female and child hostages and prisoners had been due to take place on Thursday but was postponed as last-minute logistical issues were worked out. Sources close to the negotiations said Israel had presented a series of late requests for clarification of practical issues, and demanded the full identification of the hostages Hamas intended to release.
The diplomatic breakthrough promises the first pause in seven weeks of war in Gaza and some relief both for the 2.3 million Palestinians in the territory who have endured intensive Israeli bombardment, and for families in Israel fearful for the fate of their loved ones.
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said the military will resume fighting against Hamas “with intensity” for at least two more months. Addressing Israeli troops on Thursday, Gallant instructed them to “organise…resupply arms, and get ready to continue” during the “short” respite in fighting.
Israel’s army arrested the director of Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital on Thursday, more than a week after it surrounded and raided the medical facility. Mohammad abu Salmiya and other medics were detained, a colleague said, amid reports that the IDF had seized them as they were travelling with a World Health Organization evacuation convoy. The IDF confirmed Abu Salmiya had been arrested and transferred to the Shin Bet domestic security service for further questioning. Just two doctors are left at al-Shifa to treat the remaining estimated 200 patients, the hospital’s head of plastic surgery has said.
Israeli forces bombed at least 300 targets from the air, killing dozens of Palestinians. Gaza’s health ministry said 27 people were killed in a strike on a school affiliated with the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) in Jabaliya refugee camp. The Palestinian Wafa news agency reported that dozens had been killed in Israeli bombing raids in Nuseirat and its camp in the central Gaza Strip, and in Jabaliya in the north. Among those reported killed in Nuseirat was a photojournalist, Mohammad Moin Ayyash, and his family.
The IDF said it has killed the commander of Hamas’s naval forces in Khan Younis in an airstrike in the Gaza Strip. Amar Abu Jalalah was killed along with another member of the Hamas naval forces, the IDF said in a statement on Thursday.
More than 13,000 Palestinians have been recorded killed in Gaza since the war began, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The director of the health ministry, which is run by the Hamas government, said another 6,000 people have been reported missing and are feared buried under the rubble. Israel’s assault on Gaza followed the Hamas attack on 7 October which killed at least 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians.
UK foreign secretary David Cameron has met Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit to Israel, and expressed hope that the planned temporary truce with Hamas would be an “opportunity to crucially get hostages out and get aid into Gaza”. The Israeli prime minister told Cameron that the precondition for peace in the Middle East was the eradication of what he called the “genocidal terrorist cult” Hamas. His remarks gave the impression that Netanyahu is not currently interested in anything but a military solution to the future of Israel’s security.
Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has urged Israel to rethink its offensive in Gaza, telling its president and prime minister the number of dead Palestinians is “truly unbearable”, and that the response to Hamas’s terrorist attacks last month cannot include “the deaths of innocent civilians, including thousands of children”.
A special flight has evacuated 103 Russian nationals from Gaza, Russia’s emergencies ministry said early on Friday.
In a post on Telegram, the ministry said the group flew to Moscow aboard a chartered Ilyushin-76 aircraft, Reuters reported.
The post said 101 Russian nationals had been taken from Gaza to Egypt in the past 24 hours, bringing to more than 750 the total number of Russian evacuees. More than 650 had been flown to Russia, including more than 300 children.
The Kremlin on Wednesday hailed a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, going into effect on Friday, as the “first good news for a long time” in the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
It said humanitarian pauses were the only way to build efforts for a sustainable settlement.
The director of al-Shifa hospital, Mohammad abu Salmiya, is not under inditement and has not been accused of being a member of Hamas, the Israeli military (IDF) has told the BBC.
As we reported earlier, Abu Salmiya and other medics from Gaza’s largest hospital were detained on Thursday and transferred to Israel’s Shin Bet domestic security service for further questioning.
The IDF said that al-Shifa “under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control centre” and that Hamas fighters had sought refuge in the hospital.
Meanwhile the medical director of the Indonesian hospital, Dr Marwan Sultan, told the BBC that the facility in northern Gaza was under heavy fire, with Israeli tanks firing every 15 minutes. He told the British broadcaster:
We cannot stay in rooms as windows are being hit. We are staying in corridors in the hospital. My office was targeted several times.
He said evacuation was not taking place over concerns staff could be detained.
The number of antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes in Toronto, Canada’s largest city, has spiked significantly since the start of the Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas on 7 October, authorities have said.
Police chief Myron Demkiw said 78 hate crimes had been reported between Oct. 7 and 20 November, compared to 37 in the same time frame in 2022, Reuters reported. The real number was undoubtedly higher since some people were hesitant to come forward, he added.
The number of reported antisemitic hate crimes in this period almost trebled to 38 from 13 last year, while those involving the Muslim, Palestinian and Arab population leapt to 17 from just one in 2022.
“The impact of the events in the Middle East on our city are ongoing and have escalated since 7 October,” Demkiw told a televised news conference.
Since the Hamas raid and subsequent Israeli retaliation, 25 people have been arrested and 64 charges laid in relation to reported hate incidents.
""(Hate crimes) can traumatize not just victims, but all members of the targeted community and beyond,” said Demkiw. Toronto has temporarily boosted the size of its hate crime unit to 29 from the usual six.
With around three million people living in Toronto, it is by far the biggest city in Canada, which has a population of just over 40 million.
German police have raided the homes of members and supporters of Hamas and another Palestinian organisation which are banned in the country. AFP reports:
Around 500 members of the security forces led the operation, with 13 places searched in the capital Berlin, the interior ministry said.
Four other regions were targeted to a lesser extent as police seized smartphones, laptops and various writings, the ministry added.
“We are carrying out action against radical Islamists,” Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said earlier on Thursday.
“By banning Hamas and Samidoun in Germany, we have sent a clear signal that we will not tolerate any apology or support for Hamas’s barbaric terror against Israel.
“Islamists and ant-Semites must not feel safe anywhere,” she said.
Germany on 2 November banned Hamas and Samidoun. According to official figures, Germany hosts an estimated 450 members of Hamas, proscribed as a “terrorist” organisation by the European Union, the US and Israel.
The ministry said that while Hamas members had not staged “violent action” in Germany so far, they had tried to raise funds to help the group overseas and “influence the social and political discourse in Germany”.
It said Samidoun on the other hand was “prone to use violence ... and denies the right of Israel to exist”.
Egypt has said 130,000 litres of diesel and four trucks of gas will be delivered daily to Gaza when a four-day truce starts on Friday, according to Reuters.
Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypt’s State Information Service (SIS), also said in a statement early on Friday that 200 trucks of aid would enter Gaza daily.
The truce is expected to start at 7am (0500 GMT).
The Belgian city of Charleroi has condemned antisemitic vandalism after at least 85 Jewish graves in one of its cemeteries were damaged and objects stolen, AFP reports.
A gravedigger in a cemetery in the Marcinelle neighbourhood of the southern city discovered the damage in plots for Jewish tombs on Wednesday. An investigation has since been opened.
Paul Magnette, the mayor of Charleroi, said:
The place chosen and the theft of many stars of David leave little doubt on the antisemitic nature of the intentions.
In the name of the city, I fully condemn these abject acts.
He said he had asked the city’s administration to notify each family.
Only the cemetery’s Jewish section was affected, suggesting the antisemitic nature of the vandalism.
Belgium has registered a rise in reported antisemitic acts and comments since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October.
Police are monitoring more closely Jewish schools and places of worship.
Tens of thousands of Cubans have marched in front of the US embassy in Havana charging Israel was committing “genocide” against Palestinians in Gaza, Reuters reports.
The march, led by President Miguel Diaz-Canel, and which moved along Havana”s seaside drive, the Malecon, where the US diplomatic headquarters is located, was the first of its kind in more than a decade.
Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, now deceased, was famous for staging similar, but much larger demonstrations to protest US sanctions and meddling in Cuban affairs.
The crowd, sporting Palestinian flags and banners, chanted “free, free Palestine, Israel is genocide” and “up with Palestinian freedom” as it marched by the building and rallied nearby.
Communist-run Cuba has been a strong backer of the Palestinian cause for decades and has trained more than 200 Palestinian doctors. It does not have diplomatic relations with Israel.
“We are here and it is no coincidence that we have marched in front of the United States embassy,” Anet Rodríguez, a university professor, said.
“The United States is one of the most responsible for supporting the State of Israel ... it is supporting a massacre of the Palestinians and international laws are being violated,” she said.
The Israeli military says it is investigating after a 12-year-old boy was shot dead near the West Bank city of Nablus on Wednesday, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz has reported.
The army said in a statement that soldiers had opened fire on “rioters” who threw stones during an “operation” in the town of Beita. “Thereafter, it was reported that a Palestinian minor have been killed. The incident is being investigated,” it said.

The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has said a temporary truce in Gaza will allow the agency to reach people in need in northern Gaza, as he renewed a call for a longstanding humanitarian ceasefire.
UNRWA commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, in statement published today, said he had just returned from his second visit to the Gaza Strip since the war began. He wrote:
I bear witness to the unspeakable suffering of people. Since my first visit two weeks ago, the humanitarian situation has already become far worse.
He said the UN agency now hosts more than a million displaced Palestinians in its schools and premises across Gaza Strip, adding:
People are exhausted and are losing hope in humanity. They need respite, they deserve to sleep without being anxious about whether they will make it through the night. This is the bare minimum anyone should be able to have.
The four-day ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, set to begin on Friday morning, is “an opportunity to reach people in need including in the north and to start repairing civilian infrastructure”, he said.
I have just returned from my second visit to the #GazaStrip since the war began. I bear witness to the unspeakable suffering of people.As we all anticipate the beginning of the much-awaited pause, I reiterate my call for a long-standing humanitarian ceasefire. pic.twitter.com/VGZ1C866bT
Humanitarian agencies preparing to go into Gaza continued to build up stocks of desperately needed aid ahead of a four-day humanitarian pause that is set to begin on Friday.
The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) chief, Cindy McCain, said the agency was “rapidly mobilising to scale up assistance inside Gaza” once safe access is granted.
WFP trucks are “waiting at the Rafah crossing, loaded with food slated for families in shelters and homes across Gaza, and wheat flour for bakeries to resume operations”, she said.
Under the deal reached by Israel and Hamas, Israel will allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.
On Thursday, Majed al-Ansari, the spokesperson for the foreign ministry of Qatar, announced the ceasefire would start at 7am local time on Friday (0500 GMT). Increased aid for Palestinians would start to enter “as soon as possible”, Ansari said.
Just over 73 truckloads of WFP food aid have made it into Gaza since limited aid deliveries through the Rafah crossing with Egypt resumed on 21 October, the agency said.
Speaking on Thursday, McCain expressed hope that more fuel will be let into Gaza “so that our trucks can carry in much-needed supplies and that once again bread will be available as a lifeline to hundreds of thousands of people every day”.
Hamas is set to release 23 Thai hostages it is holding in Gaza without any conditions, according to a report by the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news site.
The release of Thai hostages would not be connected to the deal reached by Israel and Hamas over the release of dozens of Israeli hostages held by militants as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, the outlet said.
The announcement comes after Iran-mediated talks between the Palestinian militant group and the Thai government, it said.
Qatari @alaraby_ar: Hamas is expected to release the 23 Thailand citizens that he took as hostages. The release *Is not connected to the hostage deal*.According to the report, this was an agreement reached by Iran.
The Thai government has reportedly been in talks with Iran to secure the release of its 23 hostages held in Gaza since the 7 October Hamas terror attacks on Israel. It is the largest single group of foreigners held by the militant group, AP reported.
At least 32 Thai citizens were killed by Hamas on 7 October, according to Thai government figures.
Turkey’s health minister, Fahrettin Koca, has discussed plans to evacuate wounded or sick Palestinian children and young people from Gaza tomorrow.
A group of 50 Palestinians are expected to be brought over from Gaza on Friday as part of Turkey’s third round of evacuation, Reuters reported.
Koca said three sick children had been brought from Gaza to Turkey on Thursday. The children – a two-year-old boy, and two girls aged nine and 10 – will receive treatment in Turkey, he told reporters. He added:
We expect the third evacuation to be tomorrow [Friday] and it will be an evacuation that will largely consist of children and young people.
Turkey has so far brought 150 people, mostly cancer patients and their companions, from Gaza to continue their treatment. It has also evacuated more than 100 Turks, Turkish Cypriots, and their relatives this week.

Israel-Hamas war: Biggest aid convoy since start of war enters Gaza – as it happened,2023-11-25,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/24/israel-hamas-war-live-ceasefire-set-to-begin-on-friday-morning-with-hostage-release-due-shortly-after,"This blog is now closed. See all our Israel-Hamas war coverage here
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have confirmed that the Israeli hostages freed from Gaza are now in Israel and have undergone medical checks.
A statement from the IDF reads:
The released hostages underwent an initial medical assessment inside Israeli territory. They will continue to be accompanied by IDF soldiers as they make their way to Israeli hospitals, where they will be reunited with their families.

It’s turned 7.15am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv and we’ll close this blog in a moment. Our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war will resume soon, and in the meantime you can see all our coverage here. Here’s where things stand.
The first group of hostages were released by Hamas – 13 Israelis, 10 Thais and a Philippine national – on Friday. The 13 Israelis, who included very young children and older women, had reached their home country by early evening. The Thai ministry said it “will do all possible to expedite” the return of their nationals to Thailand. Israel has received a list of hostages who are expected to be released by Hamas on Saturday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says.
Thirty-nine Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel on Friday evening. They consisted of 24 women, including some convicted of attempted murder for attacks on Israeli forces, and 15 teenagers jailed for offences such as throwing stones. Celebrations have been taking place in the occupied West Bank following their release.
The hostage release came as part of a deal that has brought about a temporary pause in hostilities, with the four-day ceasefire marking the first break in seven weeks of war in Gaza. Under the agreement, Hamas is due to free at least 50 of the about 240 mostly Israeli hostages it has held since launching attacks into southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. In return, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
The families of the 10 Thai hostages released on Friday had been notified, Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs said, and the group was now with officials from the Thai embassy. The ministry also said there were now an estimated 20 Thai nationals who were still being held in Gaza.
US president Joe Biden said the chances were “real” that a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be extended. Biden said Friday’s hostage release was the “start of a process” and that he “will not stop” until all remaining hostages in Gaza were brought home. The deal reached by Israel and Hamas involved “extensive US diplomacy”, he said, adding: “It’s only a start, but so far it’s gone well.” Biden also said he expected American citizens to be among the hostages who would be released.
Most of the Israeli hostages released by Hamas were said to be in good health after returning to Israel, the hospital receiving them announced. Schneider Children’s hospital, where four women and four child hostages were released, said doctors had conducted a preliminary examination and said they were all in in good physical condition.
Some 137 trucks of goods were offloaded by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reception point in the Gaza Strip on Friday. The UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said it was “the biggest humanitarian convoy received” in Gaza since 7 October. In addition, 129,000 litres of fuel and four trucks of gas also crossed into Gaza, it said.
Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos said on X that he was “overjoyed” to confirm that a Filipino, Gelienor “Jimmy” Pacheco, was among the first group of hostages released on Friday. Pacheco was working as a carer when he was captured by Hamas during the 7 October attacks.
The World Health Organisation has voiced concern about the fate of the head of Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, whom Israeli forces detained over the facility’s alleged use by Hamas.
Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to gather in London for the latest demonstration calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The Metropolitan police will be on high alert and about 1,500 officers will be deployed for the protests on Saturday.
The Israeli offensive on Gaza has killed more than 14,000 people, thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials. More are thought to be buried under rubble. At least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October, and more than 240 people taken hostage.
The war is paused, but it is not over.
There will be relief at the promised four days of quiet between Israel and Hamas, and there will be joy for the families waiting to be reunited with loved ones, thanks to Friday’s exchange of hostages held in Gaza for prisoners held in Israel.
But even if the ceasefire is extended, perhaps in return for the release of more Hamas-held captives, this war will not be over anytime soon. If anything, it is likely to intensify.
It is too big to stop now, it runs too deep. And it has already turned Israel upside down.
You only have to spend a few days in the country to see that. The war is everywhere. 
In case you missed this earlier, Jonathan Freedland has spoken to survivors, displaced people and senior political and military figures about life in Israel before and after 7 October, and considers the longer-term ramifications:
The World Health Organisation has voiced concern about the fate of the head of Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, whom Israeli forces detained over the facility’s alleged use by Hamas.
The WHO said in a statement that the chief of the Gaza Strip’s biggest hospital, Mohammad Abu Salmiya, had been arrested on Wednesday along with five other health workers while they were taking part in a UN mission to evacuate patients, Agence France-Presse reports.
“Three medical personnel from the Palestine Red Crescent Society and three from the ministry of health were detained,” the WHO said.
Since then two of the six have reportedly been released, but “we do not have information about the well-being of the four remaining health staff, including the director of al-Shifa hospital”, the statement added.
The UN agency called for “their legal and human rights to be fully observed during their detention”.
A spokesperson for the Israeli army said on Saturday that Abu Salmiya was being questioned. Doron Spielman said:
We are currently moving forward with... questioning him over the fact that he was the head of a hospital that was really sitting on top of an entire terror network.
How could he not know what’s happening? We have hostages that were on, you know, CCTV in his hospital.
The Israeli army, which raided the hospital last week, has alleged Hamas fighters used a tunnel complex beneath the facility. Hamas and hospital officials have repeatedly denied the claims.
During the WHO’s latest mission to the hospital on Wednesday – carried out in cooperation with the Palestine Red Crescent – 151 people were evacuated, including patients, their relatives and healthcare workers, according to the WHO.
Israel has received a list of hostages set to be freed by Hamas from Gaza on Saturday, Israeli officials said, following the release of 24 hostages on Friday – the first of a planned four-day ceasefire.
Reuters reports that Israeli security officials were reviewing the list, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement, after his government’s vow to work for the release of all hostages taken by Hamas in the militant group’s attack on southern Israel on 7 October.
The pause in the fighting was the first such break, with both sides saying hostilities would resume as soon as the truce ends. US president Joe Biden, however, expressed hope the pause could be extended.
The released hostages, including Israeli women and children and Thai farm workers, were transferred from Gaza and handed to Egyptian authorities at the Rafah border crossing, along with eight staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross in a four-car convoy, the organisation said.
They were then taken to Israel for medical checks and reunions with relatives.
Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs said the families of the 10 Thai hostages released by Hamas on Friday had been notified, and the group was now with officials from the Thai embassy.
The ministry said in a statement.
This group will stay in the hospital for at least 48 hours, while RTE [the royal Thai embassy] will make all the necessary arrangements for their travel back to Thailand and their families as soon as possible.
The ministry has confirmed that 10 Thai hostages were released on Friday, not 12 as was initially suggested by Thai authorities.
.@MFAThai images of the 10 Thai hostages released on Friday. Families have been notified and the group is now with embassy officials. There are now an estimated 20 Thai nationals still being held (4 of the people recently released had not previously been confirmed as hostages) pic.twitter.com/Eb6PDvc4dY
The ministry also said there were now an estimated 20 Thai nationals who were still being held in Gaza. It was previously thought that at least 26 Thai nationals had been abducted, including the 10 people recently released. However, of the group of 10 released on Friday, four had not previously been confirmed as hostages.
The ministry thanked all governments and organisations who helped to secure Friday’s release, saying:
The Thai government would like to express, once again, its deepest appreciation to all of the parties from whom the Thai authorities had sought assistance and support, such as the governments of Qatar, Israel, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia and the ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross], as well as others involved in the immense efforts that led to this recent release.
We sincerely hope that the remaining hostages will be treated humanely and released safely as soon as possible.
Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos has said on X that he is “overjoyed” to confirm that a Filipino, Gelienor “Jimmy” Pacheco, was among the first group of hostages released on Friday.Pacheco was working as a carer when he was captured by Hamas during the 7 October attacks.Marcos added:
He is now safely in the custody of officials in our Israel Embassy. I salute the work of the Philippine Foreign Service in securing his release, and once again thank the State of Qatar for their invaluable assistance in making Jimmy’s release possible.
Marcos said the search for a second missing person continued.
We remain concerned over the whereabouts of our other national, Ms Noralyn Babadilla, and are sparing no effort to locate and secure her if she is indeed found to be one of the hostages. We pray for the continued success of the truce and for all hostages to be released.
I am overjoyed to confirm that a Filipino, Mr. Gelienor “Jimmy” Pacheco, was among the first group of 24 hostages released by the Hamas yesterday.He is now safely in the custody of officials in our Israel Embassy. I salute the work of the Philippine Foreign Service in…

The Metropolitan police said officers would hand out leaflets to provide “absolute clarity” on what would be deemed at Saturday’s pro-Palestinian rally in London, where tens of thousands are expected to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said:
This sets out that anyone who is racist or incites hatred against any group should expect to be arrested. As should anyone who supports Hamas or any other banned organisation.
Organisers Stop the War coalition said such a measure was “intrusive” but asked anyone attending to avoid “any actions that might leave you or others around you open to arrest”.
The afternoon will also see a protest by Hizb-ut-Tahrir outside the Egyptian embassy. It is the first by the group since 21 October, after a video emerged showing a man chanting “jihad”, prompting an outcry from politicians.
A march organised by the charity Campaign Against Antisemitism is also due to take place on Sunday, with about 40,000 to 50,000 people expected to attend.
Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to gather in London for the latest demonstration calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
PA Media reports that about 1,500 officers will be deployed for the protests, which come amid the temporary truce in the war and Hamas’ release of 24 hostages, along with Israel’s release of 39 Palestinian prisoners.
The Metropolitan police will be on high alert in the capital, after a previous rally on Armistice Day saw scenes of violent disorder after counter-protesters clashed with officers.
The Met had come under severe pressure from politicians over the decision to allow that march to go ahead, with former home secretary Suella Braverman accusing the force of showing bias in favour of leftwing protesters.
About 100,000 people are expected to march on Saturday from Park Lane to Whitehall, as organisers rejected the label of “hate march” deployed by Braverman before she was sacked by prime minister Rishi Sunak.

Most of the Israeli hostages released by Hamas were said to be in good health after returning to Israel, the hospital receiving them announced.
A statement from Schneider Children’s hospital, where four women and four child hostages were released, said doctors had conducted a preliminary examination and said they were all in in good physical condition, Associated Press reports.
A total of 13 Israeli hostages were freed on Friday and transferred to three separate hospitals across Israel. Thirty-nine Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel on Friday evening.
Reuters has posted a video report on displaced Palestinians in Gaza saying they’re not being allowed to return north as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire continues.
A man beside a road in Khan Younis, in the territory’s south, says in the video, posted on X (formerly Twitter):
They didn’t let us go back to Gaza City to see our children. They’re young and don’t know their way ... No one knows what to do or how we will bring them back.
We are poor people, I got them food to eat. Our hearts are aching.
Gaza residents said the Israelis had dropped leaflets warning people not to return to northern Gaza Strip as a temporary ceasefire between Israeli and Hamas began https://t.co/4yk9LThC3u pic.twitter.com/aeBz26nOpg
As we posted earlier, Israeli troops fatally shot two Palestinians and wounded 11 others on Friday as they headed toward northern Gaza, Associated Press reported.
The shooting took place as hundreds of Palestinians who sought refuge in southern Gaza were seen trying to head back to the north, despite warnings by the Israeli army not to attempt to return to their homes.
Witnesses said Israeli troops were opening fire on people trying to head north.
An AP journalist saw the two bodies and the wounded as they arrived at a hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah in the southern half of Gaza. The injured people had been shot in the legs.
For the families of the Israelis hostages freed by Hamas, there was happiness mingled with concern for those who remained in Gaza, Reuters reports.
“I am happy I received my family back, it’s allowed to feel joy and it’s allowed to shed a tear. That’s a human thing,” said Yoni Katz Asher, whose wife Doron and children Raz and Aviv were freed on Friday.
But I am not celebrating, I will not celebrate until the last of the hostages returns home.
Israeli leaders have sworn to free the rest of the hostages as the military pursues its invasion of Gaza in the wake of Hamas’ attack on 7 October.
For the moment, the hostages are being kept away from the media while their condition is assessed. And for those whose relatives have not come home, the wait continues in a conflicting swirl of feelings.
“The emotions are mixed emotions,” said Shelly Shem Tov, the mother Omer Shem Tov, 21, who had attended the outdoor Supernova dance festival that was targeted in the attack and was among those taken hostage. He was not among those released on Friday.
“I’m excited for the families who today are going to hug their loved ones,” she said in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12.
I am jealous. And I am sad. Mostly sad that Omer is still not coming home.
Hamas released the first group of hostages – 13 Israelis, 10 Thais and a Philippine national – on Friday, while Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners.

Organisers of a march against antisemitism billed as Britain’s biggest since the second world war have demanded that the far-right leader Stephen Yaxley-Lennon stay away.
Yaxley-Lennon, who uses the name Tommy Robinson, has claimed to support the aims of the march through central London due to be held this Sunday.
Organisers say it will be the biggest protest against anti-Jewish hatred since the 1936 Cable Street protests against Oswald Mosley’s blackshirts.
Britain’s Jewish communities have suffered a large rise in antisemitism since the Middle East exploded into crisis after the Hamas attacks against Israel on 7 October. Police said up to 50,000 people were expected at Sunday’s march.
A spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism said:
Contrary to what Tommy Robinson appears to believe, the drunken far-right thugs who came to ‘protect the Cenotaph’ on Armistice Day, some of whom shouted ‘sieg heil’ or hospitalised police officers, are not allies of the Jewish community and are not welcome at our solidarity march on Sunday 26 November.
We look forward to seeing those who genuinely support our community and invite all of our allies to join us and march shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with British Jews.
On 11 November, Armistice Day, Robinson supporters were among those who attacked police after claiming to be protecting war monuments from pro-Palestine marchers.
The Met deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said:
Having spoken to the Campaign Against Antisemitism, Tommy Robinson is not welcome at the march on Sunday.
Police said they were aware that Robinson might try to attend posing as a reporter.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is “extremely concerned” about the safety of the estimated 100 patients and health worker remaining at Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital.
In a statement published today, the WHO said it did not “have information about the well-being” of four health workers who have been arrested, including the director of al-Shifa hospital.
On Thursday, Mohammad abu Salmiya and other medics were reportedly arrested by members of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) as they were travelling with a WHO evacuation convoy. 
The WHO said it participated in a “high-risk mission” on Wednesday, in cooperation with the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), to transfer 151 patients, relatives and health workers from al-Shifa.
During the screening process by members of the IDF, three medical personnel from the PRCS and three from the health ministry were detained, it said. The statement continued:
Two of the six detained health workers have reportedly been released. We do not have information about the well-being of the four remaining health staff, including the director of Al-Shifa hospital. WHO calls for their legal and human rights to be fully observed during their detention.
The IDF has confirmed Abu Salmiya had been arrested and transferred to the Shin Bet domestic security service for further questioning. It said that al-Shifa “under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control centre” and that Hamas fighters had sought refuge in the hospital.
The US president has said he expects American citizens to be among the hostages who will be released.
Posting to social media, he said:
Beginning today, under the deal reached between Israel and Hamas, fighting in Gaza will halt for four days.
13 Israeli hostages have been released along with several Thai nationals.
And we expect that dozens more, including Americans, will be returned to their families.

Protesters shouted “free Palestine” as Joe Biden took a stroll through Nantucket in Massachusetts with first lady Jill Biden on Friday.
The protest happened shortly after the president made a statement welcoming the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.
Here’s a clip:
Most of the Israeli hostages released by Hamas earlier today were said to be in good health after returning to Israel, the hospital receiving them announced.
AP reported that a statement from Schneider Children’s hospital, where four women and four child hostages were released, said that doctors had conducted a preliminary examination and said they were all in good physical condition.
An Israeli health ministry spokesperson confirmed that eight released hostages had arrived at Schneider Children’s hospital, adding:
This is a complex event, both medically and emotionally.
Joe Biden has said the chances were “real” that a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be extended.
The pause in hostilities, which began this morning and will initially last four or five days, was announced early on Wednesday and has raised hopes for a more durable pause in the violence.
The US president, speaking to reporters from Nantucket, Massachusetts earlier today, was asked whether the truce could be extended, Reuters reported. He replied:
I think the chances are real.
Asked what his expectations were, Biden said “I don’t know how long it will take,” adding:
My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can.
He also said that conditioning military aid to Israel was a “worthwhile thought, but I don’t think if I started off with that we would have ever gotten where we are today”, AP reported.
Spain and Belgium’s prime ministers called for a “permanent ceasefire” on Friday at the Rafah border crossing, welcoming a four-day truce that paused fighting between Israel and Hamas.
“It is absolutely necessary to establish a lasting humanitarian ceasefire to reverse the catastrophic situation that the people of the [Gaza] Strip are going through,” said Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez.
Alexander De Croo, Belgium’s prime minister, echoed Sánchez, saying: “The destruction of Gaza is unacceptable. We cannot accept that a society is being destroyed the way it is being destroyed.”

Israelis and Palestinians can no longer avoid a fateful choice about their future | Dahlia Scheindlin,2023-11-26,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/26/israelis-and-palestinians-can-no-longer-avoid-fateful-choice-about-future-gaza,"From late Friday afternoon, all of Israel was riveted to screens. For hours, the country watched and waited nervously for glimpses of the 13 Israeli and 11 foreign hostages being released from captivity in Gaza, after being snatched by Hamas from their homes on 7 October. Families of the hostages had been begging their government to reach a deal for the release of their loved ones ever since. Now it was here.
Headlines tracked every tidbit of information of their journey from somewhere in the ruins of Gaza, to their crossing into Egypt, then Israel, before being whisked off to hospitals for medical attention. It was the first collective bright spot since that terrible Saturday.
But not everyone could be happy, and those who were happy were simultaneously anguished: more than 200 hostages are still being held in unknown locations, their medical condition also unknown. Some are probably dead, others may yet die. The deal between Israel and Hamas involves the release of 50 hostages over four or five days of a ceasefire, and Israel will release three times as many Palestinian prisoners being held in its jails.
After searing debates last week in Israel over the emerging deal, some Israelis compared the situation to Sophie’s Choice, the 1979 novel by William Styron, later a film, in which the title character must choose which of her two children to sacrifice in a concentration camp; the term has since become a metaphor for unbearable choices. Which hostages would be saved, which would be left, possibly for ever?
Although many Israelis demanded such a deal, even holding a march across the country last weekend, others petitioned for a court to delay the deal, accusing the government of discriminating between “blood and blood” with the partial hostage release. Israel’s high court rejected the petition, declining to intervene in the government’s decision.
Alon Nimrodi, the father of a captured soldier – Hamas will surely hold soldiers for as long as possible – said last Monday: “There’s selection going on here – that’s a very tough word – selection.” He knows the word reminds Israelis of the Nazis at Auschwitz performing selections to decide which incoming prisoners would live (for the time being), or die immediately.
Two ultra-nationalist, rightwing political parties in the governing coalition originally opposed the deal; Religious Zionism insisted that Hamas was desperate for a pause in the fighting in order to regroup and strengthen itself for further fighting, in which more Israeli soldiers would die. That party eventually changed its mind, but the Jewish Power party’s three representatives voted against the deal.
The risks of the terrible choice go beyond the current deal. Israel has made numerous agreements to release Palestinian prisoners in the past. Some revert to their pre-prison ways. Yahya Sinwar is a prime example. One of more than 1,000 released in the 2011 deal in exchange for one Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, Sinwar went on to become Hamas’s political leader in Gaza; Israel claims he is among the top figures responsible for the 7 October massacres. The legal petition against the latest deal argued that the 2011 hostage-prisoner exchange was directly responsible for the apocalyptic carnage a dozen years later.
Finally, there is the overarching problem with hostage release deals: they prove to the Palestinian militant factions how effective is hostage-taking. In the heat of the moment, every Israeli wants the living hostages back. It’s never the right time to “change the game” in the middle, wrote the petitioners who lost their case in court last week. But in between these crises, there is no change of the general equation or calculus.
In fact, the cycle of unresolved conflict dilemmas leading to life or death crises that raise even worse dilemmas characterises the conflict more broadly. When Hamas rose to power in Gaza in 2007, Israel was faced with a tough choice: tolerate its presence, or take action to try to undermine and contain it? The first could endanger everyone, and the government chose the latter – tightening a closure over Gaza to make life unbearable there, hoping that Palestinian residents would topple Hamas in anger, or at least that the closure could contain the security threat. Neither worked; instead, Israel and Hamas fought a series of wars (what Israelis call “operations,” or “escalations”).
Yet Israel told itself that there was no dilemma. During the first one in late 2008, it was impossible to talk about alternative paths while Israel was at war. During subsequent rounds, in 2012, 2014, 2021, 2022, each time was not the time to talk about changing course. Yet between wars, the same conditions that led to each escalation – Gaza’s isolation, closure, lack of economic or political horizon, authoritarian rule – remained. During each round, and in between, if anyone questioned the policy on Gaza, Israelis said “ein breira” – we have no choice.
Moreover, Gaza itself is a stand-in for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and occupation as a whole. Israel has had choices to make over the decades, not only during a crisis. Palestinians, pinned to the ground by Israel, by their own leadership, by history itself, had choices too, and has them even now – some Palestinians are already weighing those options. In fact, there is no ein breira. As Israel crushes Gaza, it may say “we have no choice” but when the guns fall silent – for a time, at least – at every step there will be more such choices to make.
Should Israel revive the war, as its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has promised? Should Hamas choose the path of total destruction for its cynical power play to dominate Palestinian politics? And perhaps the biggest question of all: should Israelis and Palestinians take the risk of changing the rules of the game, reviving a long-atrophied path of political resolution to head off this hellish fate?
The risks are considerable: peace agreements involve painful concessions and setbacks, and generate violence from spoilers. History has shown that people will die during peace negotiations and even after peace is signed, like the victims of the Omagh bombing after the 1998 Good Friday agreement. And it’s worrying to consider precedent that political concessions are won through intolerable violence.
But people are dying cruelly today; it’s hard to imagine anything worse than the present. We have lived with war for ever, while a comprehensive peace agreement has never been tried.
The alternatives exist: such as an updated version of two states, ideally in a confederation arrangement, offering open borders, built-in security and economic cooperation between the two sides, sharing Jerusalem, and a more hopeful horizon. There is nothing simple about this path; the main winning argument for peace is that a policy of letting the occupation fester has failed.
“Sophie’s choice” remains terrible. But it is still better than ein breira – the lie that there is no choice.

"Deal agreed to extend Gaza ceasefire for two days, say Hamas and Qatar ",2023-11-27,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/27/deal-agreed-to-extend-gaza-ceasefire-for-two-days-say-hamas-and-qatar,"Palestinian group says it has agreed to continuation of truce with same conditions, but Israel has not commented
A deal to extend the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas by two days has been agreed after a frantic dash by mediators with just over 12 hours remaining before hostilities in Gaza were due to resume.
Hamas said it had agreed to the extension of the four-day truce by 48 hours after the intervention of Qatar and Egypt, the principal mediators for the initial agreement, and with the same conditions.
There was no immediate confirmation from Israel, but António Guterres, the UN secretary general, hailed the extension as “a glimpse of hope and humanity in the middle of the darkness of war”.
There are widespread fears that any break in the conflict that has devastated swaths of Gaza and killed many thousands of civilians will only be brief.
Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, told troops on Monday that when fighting recommenced its “strength will be greater, and it will take place throughout the entire strip”. “You now have a few days, we will return to fighting, we will use the same amount of power and more,” Gallant said.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has pledged to crush Hamas.
International pressure for an extension of the ceasefire had been intense, with the US, the UN and the EU’s most senior diplomat calling on Israel not to restart its offensive in Gaza when the current truce was due to expire on Tuesday morning.
The likely terms of any extension were the daily release of 10 Israeli hostages from among those seized by Hamas during its assault on southern Israel last month and of 30 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, officials close to the talks said earlier on Monday. Also, desperately needed humanitarian aid would continue to flow into Gaza.
Eleven Israeli hostages were released late on Monday night – nine children and two mothers – bringing the total number Hamas has released since Friday to 58, including foreigners. Qatar said the newly released hostages included three with French citizenship, two with German citizenship and six Argentine citizens.
According to some reports, six Thai hostages, farm workers seized with Israelis, were due to be released too.
Late on Monday evening it was reported 33 Palestinians had been released from Israeli prisons. Reuters, citing Hamas-affiliated media, reported that 30 children and three women were freed. It brings the total number of Palestinians released to about 150.
The White House welcomed the agreement to extend the truce. Joe Biden said the deal had been achieved “through extensive US mediation and diplomacy”, adding: “We are taking full advantage of the pause in fighting to increase the amount of humanitarian aid moving into Gaza, and we will continue our efforts to build a future of peace and dignity for the Palestinian people.”
The US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters: “We would of course hope to see the pause extended further, and that will depend upon Hamas continuing to release hostages.”
Guterres pushed on Monday for a full humanitarian ceasefire instead of a temporary truce, which Israel has so far resisted. His spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said: “The dialogue that led to the agreement must continue, resulting in a full humanitarian ceasefire, for the benefit of the people of Gaza, Israel and the wider region.”
Guterres again called for the hostages held by Hamas to be released immediately and unconditionally, Dujarric said. Hamas had been reported to be seeking a four-day extension while Israel wanted day-by-day extensions. Splits within the militant organisation have complicated talks, as have difficulties communicating with leaders in Gaza.
“An agreement has been reached with the brothers in Qatar and Egypt to extend the temporary humanitarian truce by two more days, with the same conditions as in the previous truce,” a Hamas official said in a phone call with Reuters.
Another suggested that the militant Islamist organisation might be ready to negotiate the release of some of the military personnel seized last month. The future of these hostages has not previously been discussed.
Earlier, an Israeli official reiterated Israel’s position that it would agree to an extra day of truce for the release of each group of 10 hostages. In exchange, three times the number of Palestinian prisoners would be released each time. The limit would be five days, the official added.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said an extension could allow the international community to work on a political solution to the conflict.
The war was triggered when Hamas broke through the perimeter fence around Gaza on 7 October and attacked communities in southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians in their homes or at a music festival. More than 240 people were abducted, including infants, elderly people, disabled people, soldiers and foreign farm workers.
Between 13,000 and 15,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli offensive launched after the Hamas attack, roughly two-thirds of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. More than 1 million people have been forced from their homes.
The White House said US officials hoped two American women would be among those freed from Gaza, where it believes eight or nine US citizens are being held.
Qatar has said Hamas needs to find dozens of hostages in order to extend the truce. Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said at least 40 women and children were being detained in Gaza but were not being held by Hamas.
“If they get additional women and children, there will be an extension,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “We don’t yet have any clear information how many they can find because … one of the purposes [of the pause] is they will have time to search for the rest of the missing people.”
Many hostages are believed to be in the hands of other armed factions or civilians who followed Hamas militants into Israel on 7 October. At least two of the Israeli hostages released on Monday were held by another unidentified organisation in Gaza, Israeli military officials said.
The truce has allowed significant quantities of aid to reach Gaza for the first time since the war began. But agencies say much more is needed to deal with the consequences of the fighting, massive bombardment, mass displacement and the almost total blockade imposed by Israel on fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are sheltering in hugely overcrowded UN shelters, hospitals and private homes. In southern Gaza, salt has become a rarity, bread is cooked on metal sheets over wooden fires and donkeys are used for transport, according to some displaced people spoken to.
The UN said the truce had made it possible to increase the delivery of food, water and medicine to the largest volume since the start of the war. On Monday, Israeli authorities said 200 trucks had entered Gaza from Egypt, though this is still fewer than half what Gaza was importing before the fighting, while humanitarian needs have soared.
On Sunday, Hamas freed 17 people, including a four-year-old Israeli-American girl abducted after seeing her parents shot dead. “They are in our arms. They are fine, in good condition and they are smiling,” said Inbar Goldstein after her sister-in-law Chen Goldstein-Almog, 48, was released with three of her four children: Agam, 17, Gal, 11, and Tal, eight.
Palestinians released from prison by Israel have been greeted by jubilant crowds in the occupied West Bank. In Ramallah, freed prisoners carried on the shoulders of their supporters and draped in the Hamas flag said they prayed for “God to give strength to the resistance”, referring to Hamas and the other armed groups in Gaza.
The crowd shouted: “They say Hamas are terrorists but we are all Hamas.”
Omar Abdullah al-Hajj, 17, released on Sunday, said he had no idea about events in Gaza or Israel while in prison. “We were 11 people crammed into a single room where usually there are six. There was never enough food and I was never told how long I was going to stay,” he said. “I can’t believe I’m free now – but my joy is incomplete because we still have our brothers who remain in prison.”
Israel’s justice ministry accused him of belonging to the Islamic Jihad militant group and posing an unspecified security threat.
There are still more than 7,000 Palestinian prisoners detained in Israel, many of them far more prominent than the children and women freed so far. Their freedom is thought to have been one of the main objectives of last month’s attacks. Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, was released by Israel in 2011 after 23 years behind bars in an exchange of more than 1,000 prisoners for a single Israeli soldier.

The war on Gaza has sharpened Egyptian popular grievances – both on Palestine and at home | Reem Abou-El-Fadl,2023-11-29,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/29/war-gaza-egyptians-palestine-israel-hamas-protest-marches,"Watching this genocide unfold on their doorstep has jolted many Egyptians into action, from boycotting western products to protest marches
Israel’s unfolding genocide in Gaza is shaking relations between states and citizens across the Middle East. In Egypt, events have pushed the political regime’s comfortably obscured cooperation with Israel into the limelight, and have jolted millions of Egyptians out of their inward focus on daily survival amid spiralling inflation and unemployment. They are now confronted with Israeli plans to recolonise Gaza using Egypt as a conduit, by forcing Palestinians south into Sinai. Both the Egyptian state and its citizens reject this vehemently, but for different reasons. These differences reflect a chasm between the regime and the population opened by the signing of the Camp David accords in 1978, which events are widening further by the day.
Egyptians have a long history of support for the Palestinian cause, in the context of a shared Arab national identity. The public first opposed the Zionist colonisation project in the 1930s, and the army fought in the 1948 Palestine war. In the 1950s, Egypt’s president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, offered state support to the Palestinians and secured a political victory after the attack by Israel, Britain and France in 1956, but suffered defeat in the 1967 war with Israel. His successor, Anwar Sadat, secured an early victory in the 1973 war, when Egyptian troops crossed the Suez Canal to liberate Sinai, and Israel was only able to regain its balance after an airlift of US arms.
Nevertheless, Sadat later turned the Egyptian state towards “normalisation” with Israel. The population was incentivised away from protest by the US aid offered in return for what became the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Meanwhile, Palestinians lost their centrality in Egyptian public discourse, and were even smeared by some as responsible for their own misfortune. For more than 40 years, successive Egyptian regimes worked to establish Israel’s presence as a fact of life. The justification was Sadat’s claim that “the US holds 99% of the cards in the Middle East”, and that it was, therefore, futile to resist. The aim was to undo years of political, social and cultural intimacy between Egyptians and Palestinians, who were united in resistance to British colonialism years before Israel was founded.
This was never a successful project, however, and demonstrations in solidarity with Palestinians would continually erupt. The savvy leadership of Hosni Mubarak allowed these protests in order to distract from people’s domestic woes. Yet eventually, they prepared the ground for the January 2011 uprising against him. Under current president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, all mass gatherings have been banned. Egyptians have been prevented from voicing their sympathies for the Palestinians, while being told to focus on making ends meet. As some have shrewdly observed, this left Egypt a regional anomaly, with no solidarity demonstrations during the Palestinian uprising of May 2021.
This was not so in October 2023, however: Israel’s violent impunity has triggered a popular reaction in Egypt that cannot be contained. For Egyptians, the events of 7 October signified the Palestinians breaking their siege, which pierced the steady news stream of abuses, detentions, executions, and land grabs in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza. Egyptians then felt a sense of impotence as the bombardment began, particularly given their geographical proximity to Gaza. Israel has repeatedly bombed the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and obstructed aid convoys getting through. As the flow of devastating images continues, Egyptians’ grief and fury have mounted. Mosques host continuous prayers for the dead, becoming spaces for a collective processing of the horrors unfolding.
This powerful wave of sympathy has developed into a desire for active support. In Egypt’s stifled political atmosphere, many have turned to the tool of boycott, targeting western companies known to support Israel. For Egyptian youth in particular, Israel’s brutality and the west’s staunch support have been a wake-up call. Ever since the Camp David accords, many young Egyptians have looked to western popular and consumer culture, rarely questioning the credibility of the political language of human rights and democracy. Almost overnight, these myths have been shattered for millions of Egyptians, as they watch the endorsements of Israel flow out of Washington, Brussels and London, while the carnage in Gaza goes on. Some of those working in the NGO sector are reportedly debating the alternatives to western funding, and expressing profound unease at their dependence on it.
The same goes for many Egyptians’ understanding of the complicity of regional powers, particularly signatories of the Abraham accords such as the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, which had been preparing its own agreement. A recent arts festival in Riyadh was boycotted by Egyptian artists; those who went were heavily criticised. This month, the Egyptian Journalists Syndicate began organising a Palestine event featuring songs from the popular resistance of Suez in 1956. It has since launched the “world’s conscience convoy”, calling for an international coalition of volunteers to go to Rafah to pressure Israel into letting more aid through and demand an end to the war. Needless to say, both before and since the temporary truce, Egyptian public opinion opposes the Sinai plan as a new stage of ethnic cleansing in Palestine.
This is the atmosphere of mobilisation and frustration that envelops the Egyptian regime. The leadership has its own longstanding concerns that Israel wants to “export” the conflict to Egypt – these were confirmed by the leak of an Israeli intelligence document dated 13 October, proposing the “transfer” of Gaza’s Palestinians to the Sinai peninsula. This would mean housing thousands of refugees, and poses the risk of attracting Egyptians to the ranks of Palestinian armed groups, inviting Israeli strikes, or worse. Enjoying full US backing, Israel has exercised pressure on Egypt to accept, but Sisi has called Arab summits and spoken with US and European leaders, each time repeating the message of refusal.
The regime has tried to achieve this with the help of the Egyptian people. On 18 October, without any irony, the president said “millions” could be mobilised to resist US-Israeli pressure. Designated locations were soon shared online. Sisi planned to use this to absorb popular anger, and to send a message to the US, the EU and Israel that he simply could not accept the Sinai plan without risking his position.
As it happened, many who participated ended up going off script, heading for Tahrir Square. Some even chanted the 2011 uprising slogan, “Bread, freedom, social justice”, and insisted: “This is a real demonstration, not a mandate for anyone.” Police made more than 100 arrests, and Tahrir Square has since been fortified with armoured vehicles. Still, figures such as Al-Azhar Sheikh Muhammad Al-Tayyib have spoken out, endorsing Palestinian resistance, and demanding a re-evaluation of Egypt’s relations with the west.
The popularity of Palestine is such that the regime was able to harness it – despite its own record – for domestic and diplomatic leverage. Yet this popularity means it must also stay ahead of the curve, whether by containment or repression, lest Palestine activism boil over into domestic protest as it has done before. In the absence of organised opposition, this process may take years to develop, but there does appear to be a sense in which the lessons of the day – distinguishing friend from foe, truth from lies, power from resistance – are sharpening popular grievances. According to a friend, Egyptians are scrutinising themselves after years of post-revolutionary defeat: “We are like someone rising to their feet, after a hard blow.”

Israel says 30 Palestinians released after 12 hostages returned from Gaza – as it happened,2023-11-29,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/28/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-hostages-palestinians-released-gaza-ceasefire-extended,"Israel says Palestinians have been freed after nine women, a child and two foreign nationals were handed to the Red Cross
The Israel Prison Service has said it released 30 Palestinians from Israeli jails late on Tuesday in a fifth swap under a truce deal with Gaza’s Hamas militants.
In a statement, the prison service said the 30 Palestinians were released from Ofer Prison, near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, and from a detention centre in Jerusalem.
Qatar earlier said 15 women and 15 children would be released.
Mediators are meeting in Qatar, meanwhile, to try to secure an extension of the five-day truce between Israel and Hamas that is set to expire on Wednesday.
We are now closing this liveblog, but our coverage of the Israel-Hamas war continues here.
It’s just past 6am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
Hamas and Israel are expected to release more hostages and prisoners on Wednesday, the last day of the prolonged six-day truce. Israeli media have reported that Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has received a list with the names of the Israeli hostages that Hamas intends to release.
Egyptian media, quoting government sources, have reported that a preliminary understanding has been reached to extend the truce for two more days, under the same conditions that are currently being observed. Israel has said the truce could be extended further, provided Hamas continues to free at least 10 Israeli hostages a day.
US and Israeli spy chiefs have flown to Qatar for talks on how to extend the current truce in Gaza in exchange for the release of more hostages by Hamas. The discussions of the CIA director, William Burns, and the head of the Mossad, David Barnea, with the Qatari leadership are expected to focus on persuading Hamas to begin releasing the men among the remaining hostages.
Negotiations over a possible second extension of the pause in fighting in Gaza and the release of hostages being held by Hamas now include men and soldiers, according to a report. Israel would not agree to any discussion on a new hostage deal before the current one is fully implemented and all women and children who are held hostage are released, the report said.
The latest exchange of hostages in Gaza for Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails took place on Tuesday night. 12 hostages, including 10 Israelis and two Thai nationals, are now in Israel. The 30 Palestinians to be released from Israeli prisons on Tuesday include 15 children and 15 women. In a statement, the Israel Prison Service said the 30 Palestinians were released from Ofer prison, near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, and from a detention centre in Jerusalem.
There were reports that the West Bank city of Jenin had been raided by Israeli troops. Al Jazeera says that armed clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian fighters have taken place, with at least eight people injured. Christos Christou, the international president of Médecins Sans Frontières, said that the Israeli army “conducted an incursion on Jenin refugee camp.”
There were reports of some fighting in Gaza, depite the extension of the truce. Israel said a number of soldiers were lightly injured in Gaza after “three explosive devices were detonated adjacent to IDF troops in two different locations”. In a Telegram message on Tuesday, the IDF said: “In one of the locations, terrorists also opened fire at the troops, who responded with fire.” Hamas accused Israel of a “blatant breach of the ceasefire” in the northern Gaza Strip but said it was “still committed to the ceasefire so long as the enemy is committed to it”.
The UN’s aid chief, Martin Griffiths, will travel to Jordan on Wednesday for talks on the possibility of opening a second crossing, the Kerem Shalom crossing, to allow for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza from Israel. Since the temporary truce between Hamas and Israel came into force last week, about 200 trucks carrying aid have entered Gaza on a daily basis, but the amount is nowhere enough to need the needs of its population.
The Palestinian Red Crescent (PRCS) has said Israeli forces are preventing a fuel truck from entering the north of Gaza. The truck, which was passing through a checkpoint which separates the north of the strip from the south, was carrying fuel to support the work of seven PRCS ambulances operational in northern Gaza, it said on Tuesday. In a later post, it said Israeli forces prevented its emergency medical team from transferring a wounded patient to the hospital in Jenin in the occupied West Bank.
The population of Gaza, especially women and children, are at “high risk of famine” if humanitarian food supplies do not continue past the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) has warned. In an update on Tuesday, the WFP said it had delivered food to 121,161 people in Gaza since the truce began on Friday. “Six days is simply not enough to provide all the assistance needed,” it said.
There is a risk that more people could die from diseases than from bombings in Gaza if the territory’s health system is not put back on its feet quickly, a World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson said on Tuesday. “Eventually we will see more people dying from disease than from bombardment if we are not able to put back together this health system,” the WHO’s Margaret Harris said.
Philippine president Ferdinand Marocs has said he is “very happy” to announce that Noralyn Babadilla is now safely back in Israel, adding that “all Filipinos affected by the war have been accounted for”.Noralyn, who was released on Tuesday, was the second Filipino to be released by Hamas. Filipino caregiver Gelienor “Jimmy” Pacheco was among the group of hostages released on the first day of the temporary truce.
Marcos said in a statement: “We extend our sincerest gratitude to Israeli authorities for facilitating Noralyn’s release, and for all ongoing assistance to Filipinos in Israel. Our gratitude also goes to Egypt and the State of Qatar for their crucial role in this process over the past several weeks.”
About 30,000 Filipinos work in Israel, mainly in the care sector. Most live away from the conflict areas.
There are reports that parts of the city of Jenin, in the West Bank, have been closed off with checkpoints set up at routes into the city.
Al Jazeera says that armed clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian fighters have taken place, with at least eight people injured. They report that hundreds of Israeli troops have taken part in the raid, supported by more than 50 armoured vehicles.
The Palestinian Red Crescent has said that one of its medical teams was detained by Israeli troops outside a Jenin hospital, preventing them from transferring a patient with a gunshot wound in the leg to the hospital. They later said that the patient was arrested.
Christos Christou, the international president of Médecins Sans Frontières, is in Jenin and says that the Israeli army “conducted an incursion on Jenin refugee camp.”
In a video posted to X, he says that he has been trapped in the Khalil Suleiman hospital for more than two hours, while Israeli forces “operated in Jenin camp”.

Israeli media are reporting that Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has received a list with the names of the Israeli hostages that Hamas intends to release on Wednesday, the sixth group of hostages to be freed as part of the temporary truce.
The families of those on the list have reportedly been informed.
The chances of the truce being extended much beyond 10 days appear slim, analysts say.
One reason is that both sides are running out of hostages or prisoners whom they can free relatively painlessly. The Palestinians released from Israeli jails so far are mainly women and children. So, too, are the hostages freed by Hamas in Gaza. In the brutal calculations of such things, neither category includes “high value” individuals. Among the hostages, these would include military personnel. Among the prisoners, it may mean high-profile political leaders, those accused of very serious crimes and others thought to endanger Israel’s security.
One possibility is that the current ceasefire could be extended to include elderly and sick people among the remaining 180 or so hostages and the thousands of Palestinians in Israeli jails. But that would postpone, not prevent, the coming trial of strength.
Nour Odeh, an analyst and commentator based in Ramallah, said that phase 2 would not be a continuation of phase 1. “[This] is when we get into the hardball. The civilian hostages is one thing, but the soldiers is another. Hamas have said all along they want ‘all for all’ [all the hostages for all the prisoners in Israel] but I don’t think [Benjamin] Netanyahu will accept such a high price.”
She added: “The likelihood of a resumption of bombardment and also a ground offensive in the south [of Gaza] continues to loom large.”
To reconcile the apparently conflicting goals of freeing the hostages and “crushing” Hamas, Israeli officials and many analysts say military pressure is the only way to force the organisation to make concessions – despite the cost in civilian life and harm to Israel’s international reputation.
Egypt’s Al-Araby Al-Jadeed newspaper is reporting that a preliminary understanding has been reached to extend the truce for two more days, under the same conditions that are currently being observed. The paper has quoted Egyptian officials as its source.
Israeli officials confirmed to the Haaretz newspaper that the proposal was being examined, but has not yet been confirmed. Haaretz reports an Israeli source as saying the agreement on an extension depended on whether Hamas is able to release 10 additional Israeli hostages a day.
As we reported earlier, with fewer women and children remaining in captivity extending the truce may require Hamas to free at least some Israeli men for the first time.
The AFP news agency has reported on the testimony of some of the recently freed Israeli hostages, who have detailed the conditions of their confinement.
None of the hostages released under the truce have so far given any direct accounts of the conditions in which they were held and hospitals say they have been instructed to refrain from disclosing details.
However some details are slowly surfacing from medical professionals treating them, while relatives are offering more dramatic accounts of mistreatment and hardship.
Esther Yaeli, grandmother of 12-year-old French-Israeli boy Eitan Yahalomi, who was released on Monday, told the Walla news website he was held in solitary confinement for 16 days.
“The days that he was alone were horrible,” she said. “Now Eitan appears very withdrawn.”
His aunt, Deborah Cohen, said that Eitan suffered “horrors” at the hands of Hamas and described them as “monsters”.
She told France’s BFM TV: “Hamas forced him to watch films of the horrors, the kind that no one wants to see, they forced him to watch them.
Hagar Mizrahi, the head of the Israeli health ministry’s operations for returning hostages, told AFP that they had been held in “horrible conditions” and that “the medical consequences are pretty clear”.
“Some of the things that I’ve heard in recent days are heart-wrenching,” she added, offering no specifics. “They’re simply outrageous in every way.”
Ruti Munder, 78, said she was kept in a “suffocating” room and slept on plastic chairs with a sheet for nearly 50 days.
In one of the first interviews with a freed hostage, Munder told Israel’s Channel 13 television that initially they ate “chicken with rice, all sorts of canned food and cheese”.
They were given tea in the morning and evening, and the children were given sweets, but the food changed when “the economic situation was not good, and people were hungry”, she said.
Here’s where the temporary pause in fighting stands as Wednesday begins in the Middle East. Hamas and Israel are expected to release more hostages and prisoners today, the last day of the prolonged six-day truce.
Israel has said the truce could be extended further, provided Hamas continues to free at least 10 Israeli hostages a day. But with fewer women and children remaining in captivity, that may require Hamas freeing at least some Israeli men for the first time.
Attention now turns to Qatar which mediated indirect talks between Hamas and Israel that resulted in the ceasefire.
On Tuesday, Qatar hosted spy chiefs from Israel’s Mossad and the United States’ CIA. The meeting sought to “build on the progress of the extended humanitarian pause agreement and to initiate further discussions about the next phase of a potential deal”, a source briefed on the visits told Reuters.
The truce has brought Gaza its first respite after seven weeks of fighting and bombardment that has reduced much of the region to rubble. The temporary ceasefire has allowed about 800 aid trucks to enter Gaza and the first of three US planes with humanitarian supplies for Gaza landed in Egypt on Tuesday.
The Biden administration has told Israel that it must work to avoid “significant further displacement” of Palestinian civilians in southern Gaza if it renews its ground campaign after the current pause in fighting, the AP news agency reported senior US officials as saying on Tuesday.
Separately, White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby said the Israelis had been receptive when US officials have raised the issue.
The White House, seeking to avoid more large-scale civilian casualties or mass displacement like that seen before the current temporary pause in the fighting, underscored to the Israelis that they must operate with far greater precision in southern Gaza than they did in the north, said officials who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, according to AP.
The White House has begun to put greater pressure on Israel that the manner of the coming campaign must be “carefully thought through,” AP reports.
Kirby, told reporters separately, “Now you have an added population of hundreds of thousands more in the south that you didn’t have before [the Israelis] moved into Gaza City.”
“And so it’s even all that more of an added burden on Israel to make sure … that they have properly accounted for … the extra innocent life that is now in south Gaza.”
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear that Israeli Defense Forces will eventually restart military operations after the conclusion of the current, temporary ceasefire.
President Joe Biden has said he would like to see the pause – which has also allowed a surge of much-needed humanitarian aid to get into Gaza – continue as long as feasible.
Thai foreign minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara has said he welcomes the release of two more Thai hostages that had been held by Hamas in Gaza.
“Happy to personally welcome 2 additional Thai hostages just released and arrived at the hospital in Tel Aviv,” he posted on the social media platform X.
Nineteen Thai hostages have so far been released, while the foreign ministry says 13 more remain in captivity. There were 39 Thai nationals killed in the 7 October attack by Hamas.
Here’s more of what we know about the 10 Israeli hostages released by Hamas on Tuesday.
Ofelia Roitman, 77
On 7 October, Roitman’s family lost contact with her shortly before 10am, while she was in her safe room. That evening, when soldiers inspected her house, they found no sign of a struggle, suggesting that the Argentinian national had been abducted.
Her husband, hospitalised after a fall, was absent at the time of the attack.
Ada Sagi, 74
Sagi, who has lived alone in Nir Oz since her husband died of cancer, was abducted from her safe room.
Her son Noam Sagi, who lives in London, had no news of his mother until he saw a video online of a stranger in his mother’s garden. Ada, who suffers from asthma, had been due to visit him to celebrate her 75th birthday.
Noralin Agojo, 60
Philippines-born Agojo was abducted from Nirim, where she was visiting friends on 7 October along with her partner Gideon Babani, who was killed in the attack. Before her capture, Agojo called her brother Exo and told him he might not see her again.
Meirav Tal, 53
Tal was freed after the release of her partner’s two children, Yagil and Or Yaakov, on Monday.
Tal and the children’s father, Yair Yaakov, who remains in Gaza, were abducted when militants stormed their home in Nir Oz as they were hiding in a safe room. The children, who were staying with their mother, were taken into Gaza separately.
Rimon Kirsht, 36
Abducted from her home in Nirim, Kirsht was taken along with her partner, Yagev Buchstab, 34, who has not been released.
Kirsht sent her mother a voice message at about 8:30am on 7 October, a relative told the media. The message ended with the sounds of militants shouting and firing shots.
Hours later, when Israeli security forces asked residents of the community to gather, Kirsht and Buchstab were missing and their house was empty.
We’re getting more information on the Israeli hostages freed by Hamas on Tuesday. Ten Israeli women including a 17-year-old were released, Israeli officials said, as well as two Thai nationals. Their release was followed by the freeing of 30 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
Here’s what we know about some of the hostages released on Tuesday.
Mia Leimberg, 17, her mother, Gabriela, 59, and aunt Clara Marman, 63
Mia, the youngest hostage released on Tuesday, her mother and aunt were all abducted from Nir Yitzhak kibbutz. Originally from Jerusalem, the Leimbergs were visiting Marman, Gabriela’s sister, when Nir Yitzhak was attacked on 7 October.
Marman’s partner, Luis Har, and brother, Fernando Marman, were also taken hostage and remain in Gaza.
Ditza Heiman, 84
The video of Heiman’s abduction in a car, alongside the testimony of a neighbour, was the only proof of life her family had until now. Living alone in Nir Oz kibbutz, the widow and former social worker had taken refuge in her safe room.
When friends attempted to reach the great-grandmother on the day of the attack, her phone rang for hours, until someone speaking in Arabic answered at around 4pm.
Tamar Metzger, 78
Metzger, a mother-of-three, and her husband, Yoram, 80, were abducted from their home in Nir Oz. She was released without her husband.
The US senate will begin consideration of legislation including aid for Israel and Ukraine as soon as next week, majority leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday.
“I’m going to put them on the floor next week, hopefully with bipartisan support, because that’s the only way you can get it done,” Schumer told a weekly news conference.
Biden asked Congress last month to approve $106bn in national security funding, including aid for Ukraine as it battles a Russian invasion, support for Israel after the 7 October attack and money for additional security at the U.S. border with Mexico.
But the funding has not been approved, raising concerns that funds for Ukraine in particular might never pass, particularly after the Republican-led House passed a bill including assistance for Israel, but not Ukraine.
Biden’s request to Congress included $60bn for Ukraine as well as about $14bn each for Israel and security at the border with Mexico.

The Israel Prison Service said early on Thursday it had freed 30 Palestinians from Israeli jails in the sixth such release under a truce arrangement with Gaza’s Hamas militant group, Reuters is reporting.
The Palestinians were released from prison facilities in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem, the prison service said in a statement.

Here are some of the latest images of the 30 Palestinian prisoners released in the latest swap. It comes as international mediators race to seal another extension to allow further exchanges and prolong the halt of Israel’s air and ground offensive.
The Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara has held back tears when he met fellow Thais released to Israel by Hamas, Reuters is reporting.
Another two Thai workers were set free on Tuesday, bringing the total released to 19. With their arrival at Shamir Medical Center, the workers embraced one another.
“We survived! We survived!” they cheered, and one was seen wiping away tears.
“We are not part of the conflict,” Parnpree said in a Reuters interview later on Wednesday after an emotional meeting with the workers on Tuesday.
He said there were no conditions for their release.
The extended truce between Israel and Hamas is due to end at 7am Thursday local time (5am GMT) and there is little sign so far of an agreement between the two sides on a second extension. It is currently 3.30am.
Haaretz is reporting that no understanding has yet been reached regarding a list of captives to be released in a next round, with Israel apparently insisting that it include women and children.
Agence France-Presse has quoted a Hamas source as saying that talks were focused on extending the pause by “two days or more” but that “what is being proposed in the discussions to extend the truce is not the best.”
Israel’s war cabinet was meeting late on Wednesday over terms to extend the truce.
Among the 30 Palestinian prisoners freed on Wednesday night was Ahed Tamimi, a 22-year-old activist who has become a key figure for Palestinians defying the Israeli occupation.
Thirty Palestinian prisoners were freed overnight Wednesday, Israeli prison authorities said, in the final exchange under an extended truce deal that is due to expire within hours.
“During the night, 30 male and female security prisoners were released from a number of prison facilities,” the country’s prison service said in a statement.
Tamimi was detained over an Instagram post, which her family denies she made.
The overnight releases, which came after a sixth batch of hostages were freed from Gaza, bring the number of Palestinian prisoners freed by Israel under a truce deal to 210.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza have released 70 Israelis under the deal, along with nearly 30 hostages of other nationalities outside the truce framework.

China says the UN security council should intensify its diplomatic mediation, relaunch the two-state solution and convene a “more authoritative and effective” international peace conference at the soonest, in a position paper on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict released on Thursday.
China also urged the security council to heed the general call of the international community for a comprehensive ceasefire to be put in place to stop the fighting, the country’s foreign ministry said in statement listing the proposals, Reuters reports.
Jordan on Thursday will host an international conference attended by the main UN bodies and regional and international relief agencies to coordinate humanitarian aid to war-devastated Gaza, official media said.
UN aid chief Martin Griffiths and key UN bodies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) involved in ramping up aid to Gaza will be present at the conference, along with representatives of western and Arab countries involved in the aid effort, Reuters reports.
The conference, to be held behind closed doors, will be addressed by King Abdullah who has been lobbying western leaders to back a UN resolution that calls for an immediate ceasefire.
The Israel Prison Service said early on Thursday it had freed 30 Palestinians from Israeli jails in the sixth such release under a truce arrangement with Gaza’s Hamas militant group, Reuters is reporting.
The Palestinians were released from prison facilities in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem, the prison service said in a statement.
The United States is urging Israel to narrow the zone of combat and clarify where Palestinian civilians can seek safety during any Israeli operation in southern Gaza, to prevent a repeat of the large death toll from Israel’s northern Gaza attacks, Reuters is reporting.
Officials from President Joe Biden down, including in the state department and the Pentagon, are reportedly pleading with Israel to take a more cautious approach if and when the Israeli military extends its offensive to southern Gaza.
It’s understood two-thirds of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have fled south to avoid the war zone in the north.
In the US, Senate majority Leader Chuck Schumer is warning that antisemitism in the country has reached levels unseen in generations, Associated Press reports. He’s called on his fellow Democrats to clearly condemn it. Schumer said:
The vitriol against Israel in the wake of 7 October is all too often crossing a line into brazen and widespread antisemitism the likes of which we haven’t seen in generations in this country, if ever
Schumer added that because many of the incidents targeting Jewish people have come alongside left-wing demonstrations against Israel, liberal Jewish people “are feeling singled, targeted and isolated.” He specifically called out the phrase “from the river to the sea,” saying it alarms Jewish people to hear it used.
He told The Associated Press he spent days over the Thanksgiving holiday writing the speech.
Schumer is the highest-ranked Jewish elected official in the US. His remarks during a nearly-45 minute speech on the Senate floor Wednesday come at a sensitive time in the Israel-Hamas war, as the Biden administration is engaged in delicate negotiations to release hostages held by Hamas and extend the ceasefire.
In an interview, he said his position “called on me to do this speech.”
US secretary of state Antony Blinken arrived on Thursday in Tel Aviv where he was expected to meet with Israeli leaders to discuss extending Israel’s temporary truce with Hamas militants and boosting humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, Reuters news agency reports.
Blinken is making his third trip to the region since the deadly 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israel and is also expected to visit the occupied West Bank, where he will probably meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, according to a Palestinian official. Blinken said at a news conference in Brussels on Wednesday:
Looking at the next couple of days, we’ll be focused on … doing what we can to extend the pause so that we continue to get more hostages out and more humanitarian assistance in
It is now slightly past 1am in Gaza and Tel Aviv. Here is where the day stands:
Sixteen hostages were released today, including 12 Israelis and four Thais. Among the Israeli hostages released today were Elena Trupanov and Irena Tati, two dual Israeli-Russian citizens who were released earlier this evening.
The Palestinians to be released from Israeli prisons in exchange include 16 minors and 14 women, the Qatari foreign ministry said.
A Hamas source said on Wednesday that the group was not satisfied with Israel’s proposals for another truce extension, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Speaking to AFP ahead of the expiration of the current truce, which will be at 7am local time on Thursday, the source said: “What is being proposed in the discussions to extend the truce is not the best.”
The Palestine Red Cross Society (PRCS) delivered 21 trucks of aid into Gaza and northern areas on Wednesday. “PRCS is committed to delivering the largest number possible of humanitarian aid to north Gaza, which had not received any aid prior to the humanitarian pause agreement,” the group said.
Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, has said Israeli forces are ready to resume fighting “immediately”. Posting to social media on Wednesday, Gallant wrote: “We are making every attempt to return all the abductees and to fully exploit the current move to return all the abducted women and children in Gaza. IDF forces in the air, on land and at sea are ready to resume fighting immediately.”
Two boys, one eight years old and the other 15, were shot and killed by Israeli forces on Wednesday in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, the Palestinian health ministry said. In a statement reported by Agence France-Presse, the health ministry said: “Adam al-Ghul, eight years old, and Bassem Abu el-Wafa, 15 years old, were killed by bullets from the occupier [Israel].”
Benjamin Nentanyahu has spoken with representatives of the Bibas family after reports from Hamas that three of its members were killed, including 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, Haaretz reports. According to Haaretz, the Israeli prime minister told the family representatives that the matter was being investigated by Israel’s security forces.
The US is hopeful that the truce in Gaza between Israel and Hamas can be extended, the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told reporters on Wednesday, Reuters reports. “We’re hopeful the truce can be extended,” Thomas-Greenfield said, adding: “This is all in the hands of Hamas. The Israelis have said if they continue to release 10 hostages a day, they will extend by a day. So it truly is in their hands. But I do think there is a potential for that and we are actively working to extend the deal.”
Three Qatari armed forces aircraft carrying 108 tons of aid for Palestinians in Gaza have arrived in El Erish, Egypt, Qatar’s news agency announced on Wednesday. The three planes, which carried basic food supplies and shelter equipment, brings the total number of Qatari planes sent to Gaza to 30, carrying 1,018 tons of aid.
Speaking at the UN security council on Wednesday, Palestine’s foreign minister, Riad al-Maliki, said that the ongoing violence between Israel and Hamas was “not a war” but rather a “carnage that no one can justify”. “It must be brought to an end,” al-Maliki said.
Jordan will host an international conference on Thursday that will be attended by the main UN bodies, as well as regional and international relief agencies to coordinate humanitarian aid to Gaza, Reuters reports. The UN aid head, Martin Griffiths, as well as key UN bodies and NGOs involved in increasing the entry of aid into Gaza, are expected to attend the conference, along with representatives from western and Arab countries.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Wednesday that Gaza is in the midst of an “epic humanitarian catastrophe”. Addressing a UN security council meeting chaired by China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, Guterres said “we must not look away” from the deteriorating humanitarian crisis that has engulfed Gaza.
Speaking at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, said that Saudi Arabia is “not going to work with anyone” who seeks to encourage Palestinians to leave their land.
Bin Farhan said:
The Palestinians do not want to leave their land and we are not going to encourage them or force them to leave their land and we are not going to work with anyone who has that agenda. The Palestinians have a right to their land and they have a right to live in safety and security and dignity on their land. That is what we will push for and that is what we will work towards.

A Hamas source said on Wednesday that the group was not satisfied with Israel’s proposals for another truce extension, Agence France-Presse reports.
Speaking to AFP ahead of the expiration of the current truce which will be at 7am local time on Thursday, the source said: “What is being proposed in the discussions to extend the truce is not the best.”
According to the source, the negotiations, which are led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators, were focused on an extension of “two days or more”.
“Any discussion on an exchange of military prisoners, soldiers and officers will first require [Israeli] aggression to stop and a lifting of the siege that is strangling Gaza,” the source told AFP, adding that Hamas is demanding Israel withdraw its tanks and military equipment from Gaza.

The Israeli army says it has fired on Hezbollah in Lebanon in response to attacks on Monday – as it happened,2023-12-05,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/dec/04/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-hundreds-palestinians-killed-israel-ground-attack-gaza-strip-news,"This blog is now closed. See our Full report here: Israel extends ground offensive into southern Gaza
A UN official has warned on Monday that “an even more hellish scenario” looms in Gaza in which humanitarian aid simply grinds to a halt.
Agence France-Presse is reporting:
“The conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist,” said Lynn Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories.
Since the end of a seven-day truce, Israeli forces have pushed into southern Gaza, “forcing tens of thousands … into increasingly compressed spaces, desperate to find food, water, shelter and safety,” Hastings said.
“Nowhere is safe in Gaza and there is nowhere left to go.”
“If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond,” Hastings said in a statement.
Hastings, a Canadian, rejected the idea of “safe zones” urged upon Israel by the US government where people are still unable to move about freely.
“These zones cannot be safe nor humanitarian when unilaterally declared,” she said.
“What we see today,” Hastings added, “are shelters with no capacity, a health system on its knees, a lack of clean drinking water, no proper sanitation and poor nutrition for people already mentally and physically exhausted: a textbook formula for epidemics and a public health disaster.”
Further complicating aid deliveries, two major roads in Gaza have been declared off-limits to UN teams and trucks, Hastings said.
Hastings has her base in Jerusalem but Israel last week informed the UN that it would not renew her visa, accusing her of not being “impartial.”

It is 4:34am on Tuesday in Gaza and Tel Aviv and this blog is now closing. You can read the full report of our coverage for more. But here is a summary of the latest developments:
A UN official has warned on Monday that “an even more hellish scenario” looms in Gaza in which humanitarian aid simply grinds to a halt. Agence France-Presse has reported that “The conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist,” said Lynn Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories. Since the end of a seven-day truce, Israeli forces have pushed into southern Gaza, “forcing tens of thousands … into increasingly compressed spaces, desperate to find food, water, shelter and safety,” Hastings said. “Nowhere is safe in Gaza and there is nowhere left to go.”
Israel’s military expanded ground operations deeper into southern Gaza, with dozens of Israeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers entering the Gaza Strip near Khan Younis. Witnesses said Israeli military vehicles were on the southern section of the main north-to-south road in Gaza, “firing bullets and tank shells at cars and people trying to move through the area”. Israeli military issued fresh orders to Palestinians in about 20 areas of central Gaza to move farther south, posting maps online.
The Israeli army has denied telling the World Health Organization to empty an aid warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours before ground operations in the area render it unusable. The Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, COGAT said on X “The truth is that we didn’t ask you to evacuate the warehouses and we also made it clear (and in writing) to the relevant UN representatives”. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X on Monday: “Today, WHO received notification from the Israel Defense Forces that we should remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours, as ground operations will put it beyond use… We appeal to Israel to withdraw the order, and take every possible measure to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and humanitarian facilities,” he wrote.
The White House said Hamas broke an agreement to release more women hostages, and its refusal to do so was the cause of the collapse of the week-long truce with Israel on Friday. In a briefing at the White House on Monday afternoon, US national security advisor Jake Sullivan said “it is that refusal by Hamas that has caused the end of the hostage agreement, and therefore the end of the pause in hostilities”. He it was “too soon” to judge if Israel provided enough notice, or done enough to inform Palestinian civilians where it would be safe as it moved into southern Gaza, but said the US warned Israel civilians must be protected.
The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Israel has assembled a large system of pumps that may be used to flood tunnels used by Hamas under the Gaza Strip in a bid to drive out fighters.
The paper is citing US officials as the source, but says the plan could threaten Gaza’s water supply.
The Wall Street Journal also said an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official declined to comment on the flooding plan but was quoted as saying: “The IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas’s terror capabilities in various ways, using different military and technological tools.”

At a press conference earlier on Monday, the WHO regional director for the eastern Mediterranean, Ahmed al-Mandhari, said the intensification of military ground operations in southern Gaza risked depriving thousands of people of health care, Agence France-Presse reports.
“We saw what happened in the north of Gaza. This cannot serve as a model for the south,” he said.
Israeli authorities are investigating claims by US researchers that some investors may have known in advance about the Hamas plan to attack Israel on 7 October and used that information to earn millions of dollars by short-selling Israeli shares.
Research by law professors Robert Jackson Jr from New York University and Joshua Mitts of Columbia University found significant short-selling of shares leading up to the attacks that triggered the war.

Unicef Spokesperson James Elder has posted a video on X a couple of hours ago about children being injured and praised the commitment of the health staff. According to the video, he’s in Nasser hospital in the Gaza Strip. Elder says in the video:

Israel’s military has renewed calls for mass evacuations from the southern town of Khan Younis, according to Associated Press.
Israeli warplanes are reported to have heavily bombarded an area around Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Monday.
The expanded assault posed a choice for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians – either stay in the path of Israeli forces or flee within the confines of southern Gaza with no guarantee of safety.
Aid workers have warned that the mass movement would worsen the already dire humanitarian catastrophe in the territory.
“Another wave of displacement is underway, and the humanitarian situation worsens by the hour,” the Gaza chief of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, Thomas White, said in a post on X.
Thomas White also described the scene yesterday:
Another wave of displacement is underway, and the humanitarian situation worsens by the hour.The roads leading South towards Rafah are clogged with cars and donkey carts packed with people and their meagre possessions.
Australia’s deputy prime minister says the country remains a safe place for Jewish people, despite Israel issuing travel warnings for its citizens looking to visit.
Israel has upgraded travel warnings to multiple countries, including Australia, after a rise in antisemitism stemming from the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, Australian Associated Press is reporting.
Travel warnings to Australia have been raised to level 2, which urges Israeli citizens to take additional precautions while visiting.
Richard Marles has urged greater social cohesion in Australia after the conflict. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation:
It’s really important that all of us, in what is a very difficult time globally, are looking after each other…
It is very important that as people legitimately express their views about what’s happening in the world, this is done in a peaceful manner … many in the Jewish community are finding this to be a very difficult time.

It’s 1am on Tuesday in Gaza and Tel Aviv. Here is a summary of the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas conflict as it nears the two-month mark:
Israel’s military expanded ground operations deeper into southern Gaza, with dozens of Israeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers entering the Gaza Strip near Khan Younis. Witnesses said Israeli military vehicles were on the southern section of the main north-to-south road in Gaza, “firing bullets and tank shells at cars and people trying to move through the area”. Israeli military issued fresh orders to Palestinians in about 20 areas of central Gaza to move farther south, posting maps online.

He it was “too soon” to judge if Israel provided enough notice, or done enough to inform Palestinian civilians where it would be safe as it moved into southern Gaza, but said the US warned Israel civilians must be protected.
The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement expressing “grave concern” about the resumption of hostilities and bombardment of southern Gaza, and warned “nowhere is safe” for civilians in Gaza. The WHO said it was appealing to Israel for protection of the health system from further attacks and degradation of its capacity, and feared a repeat of the collapse of hospitals and other essential services in the north.
A Hamas rocket fired during the 7 October attacks struck an Israeli military base where many of the country’s nuclear-capable missiles are believed to have been stored, the New York Times said in a report. None of the missiles were struck, although the attack on the Sdot Micha base in central Israel set a fire that “approached missile storage facilities and other sensitive weaponry”, according to the newspaper’s visual analysis.
Hamas engaged in years of planning, drawing up detailed maps with the help of spies inside Israel ahead of the 7 October attack, the country’s military concluded after examining vast quantities of phones, notebooks and documents seized from gunmen on the battlefield and in Gaza. Fighters also carried guides to hostage-taking and Arabic-to-Hebrew phrasebooks, one of which included the line “put your hands up and spread your legs”. The document was included in a cache of material that was released on Monday by the Israel Defense Forces’ Amshat military intelligence unit.
Matthew Miller, a US state department spokesperson, said Hamas continued to hold female Israeli hostages because it did not want them to reveal what they experienced in captivity. Hamas fighters committed widespread “gender-based atrocities and sexual violence” during the 7 October attacks according to Israeli police who say they have evidence of more than 1,500 incidents. “The fact [Hamas] continue to hold women hostages, the fact that they continue to hold children hostages … and the reason this pause fell apart, is they don’t want those women to be able to talk about what happened to them during their time in custody,” Miller told a media briefing.
Gaza’s health ministry issued new casualty figures, saying that 15,899 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip since 7 October. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government in the Gaza Strip, says that 70% of those who have been killed are women and children. It does not distinguish in the figures between civilians and combatants. The number of deaths is likely under-counted, as the collapse of the health system in Gaza has made it difficult for statistics to be gathered, and there are more than 6,000 Palestinians considered missing within the territory.
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross described the suffering in Gaza as “intolerable” while visiting the territory. Mirjana Spoljaric Egger said: “The level of human suffering is intolerable. It is unacceptable that civilians have no safe place to go in Gaza.”
Telecoms company PalTel said that Gaza is facing a communications blackout, with all telecom services (landline, cellular and internet) in Gaza City and north Gaza Strip lost due to the disconnection of main elements of the network.
Israel’s military has again said it has fired into Lebanon at the site of launches it claimed were directed into Israel. It said “a number of launches from Lebanon” had occurred, and that they had fallen in open areas, with no casualties as a result. Earlier on Monday it said that three soldiers had been “slightly injured” by fire from Lebanon at an Israeli military site.
Six hostages from Thailand kidnapped and held for weeks in the Gaza Strip by Hamas arrived back in the kingdom on Monday. Israel believes that Hamas still holds about 137 people hostage in Gaza.
At least 60 Palestinians were arrested in the occupied West Bank overnight, Al Jazeera reported, with Israeli forces carrying out raids in the cities of Qalqilya, Jericho, Jenin and Tulkarem. At least 30 armoured vehicles were deployed in Jenin following a dawn raid, the broadcaster reported.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a statement expressing its “grave concern” about the resumption of hostilities between Hamas and Israel in Gaza, the bombardment of southern Gaza, and warns that “nowhere is safe” for civilians.

In its message posted to X, formerly Twitter, on Monday afternoon, the organization said it was appealing for protection of the health system from further attacks and degradation of its capacity:
WHO is gravely concerned about the resumption of hostilities, including heavy bombardment in Gaza, and reiterates its appeal to Israel to take every possible measure to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, as per the laws of war.
We have seen what happened in northern Gaza. This cannot be the blueprint for the south. Gaza cannot afford to lose another hospital as health needs continue to soar.
As more civilians in southern Gaza receive immediate evacuation orders and are forced to move, more people are being concentrated into smaller areas, while the remaining hospitals in those areas run without sufficient fuel, medicines, food, water, or protection of health workers.

A Hamas rocket fired during the 7 October attacks struck an Israeli military base where many of the country’s nuclear-capable missiles are believed to have been stored, the New York Times said in a report published Monday.
None of the missiles were struck, although the attack on the Sdot Micha base in central Israel set a fire that “approached missile storage facilities and other sensitive weaponry”, according to the newspaper’s visual analysis.

Israel, which has always maintained a policy of ambiguity over its nuclear arsenal, probably has about 25 to 50 nuclear-capable Jericho missile launchers at the base, Hans Kristensen, director of the Federation of American Scientists’ nuclear information project, told the Times.
The missiles are equipped to carry nuclear warheads, according to experts and declassified US government documents, the newspaper said, although Kristensen noted the warheads were “most likely” kept in a separate location away from the base and not under threat during the attack.
The Times said the strike on Sdot Micha was the first known instance of Hamas hitting a site suspected of containing Israeli nuclear weaponry, although there is no evidence the group knew anything of its target other than it being a military facility.

Washington faces UN showdown over fresh resolution for Gaza ceasefire,2023-12-07,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/07/washington-faces-showdown-over-fresh-un-resolution-for-gaza-ceasefire-us-israel,"US may feel it has to protect Israel with veto again as UAE prepares security council motion
The Biden administration faces a showdown at the UN security council in the next 48 hours, at which it may feel impelled to use its veto to protect Israel by rejecting calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.
The United Arab Emirates, the only Arab country on the 15-strong security council, said it would table a resolution on Thursday for debate on Friday after the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and most Islamic states called for the ceasefire.
The UN’s humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, said promising signs had emerged from talks with Israeli officials about the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing for the inspections of aid convoys heading into Gaza. Under one version of the plan, inspected aid would then be transported to the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border.
The use of Kerem Shalom between Israel and Gaza only for the inspection and clearance of aid would stop short of the UN’s repeated call for the crossing to be opened for the transport of aid.
But Griffiths said the move would be a huge boost, since with more inspection capacity, the flow of cleared aid into Gaza could be increased. He cautioned that aid convoys were still at risk of being attacked, as no safe space existed in Gaza.
Guterres infuriated Israel on Thursday by taking the rare step of invoking article 99 of the UN charter to notify the security council that the crisis in Gaza represented a threat to world peace. It was the first time he had invoked the article since he became secretary general in 2017.
The US deputy envoy, Robert Wood, said the Biden administration did not support the Gaza issue being brought to the UN security council at this point. “We remain focused on the difficult and sensitive diplomacy geared to getting more hostages released, more aid flowing into Gaza and better protection of civilians,” he told Reuters.
The diplomatic price the US would have to pay for vetoing a ceasefire call is high, but Washington believes a ceasefire would leave Hamas entrenched in Gaza. It instead supports pauses so long as Hamas continues to release more of the hostages that it seized in its assault on Israel on 7 October.
The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, rejected calls for a full ceasefire, saying: “If you stop this and Hamas is still in control of parts of Gaza, there cannot be the long-term solution that we want. This is a murderous terrorist organisation. It does not believe in Israel’s right to exist and it cannot possibly be a partner for peace.”
America’s stance could put it at odds with the EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, who issued a statement supporting Guterres’s call. Guterres was also given support in social media statements from the heads of a broad array of UN agencies, including the heads of the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Borrell said “the UN must act immediately to prevent a full collapse of the humanitarian situation”.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, said Gaza’s health system was “near total collapse”.
In a show of solidarity at the UN headquarters on Thursday, ambassadors from most Islamic states stood alongside the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, to express their support for a ceasefire. Mansour said: “The number killed was in excess of 17,000, with 65,000 injured, of which 75% were women and children. It was so disgusting and so disgraceful to see such a large number of people killed.” He attacked what he described as the “abhorrent behaviour by the savages in the leadership of the state of israel”.
The Arab ambassadors also met the international criminal court prosecutor, Karim Khan, in New York on Tuesday to urge him to visit Gaza as soon as possible and “see with his own eyes the tragedies of the Palestinian people”. They urged him to make the fate of children central to an expedited investigation.
Khan said in a social media statement on Wednesday: “I have emphasised the imperative that humanitarian relief be allowed into Gaza immediately and at scale. I wish to reiterate in the clearest terms possible that wilfully impeding relief supplies to civilians may constitute a war crime under the ICC Rome statute.”

The US has already used its veto once to block a resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire on the basis that the draft resolution did not explicitly criticise Hamas.
A contact group of foreign ministers from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) are due in Washington on Thursday to demand that the US end its support for Israeli actions. The contact group was set up after a rare joint summit of Arab League and OIC leaders in Riyadh on 11 November. The group has been touring the capitals of the five permanent members of the UN security council.
In his letter, Guterres described “appalling human suffering, physical destruction and collective trauma across Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories” and said “the capacity of the UN and its humanitarian partners had been decimated by supply shortages, lack of fuel, interrupted communications and growing insecurity”.
He said the conditions for meaningful humanitarian operations did not exist amid the fighting. He added: “Without shelter or the essentials to survive, I expect public order to break down soon due to the desperate conditions.”
The Arab League has been asking for more border crossings to be opened and for the UN to take control of the checks on aid trucks currently conducted by Israel. In response, late on Wednesday, the Israeli cabinet permitted some fuel trucks to enter Gaza.
The draft resolution places diplomatic pressure on the US to do more to control the actions of the government of Benjamin Netanyahu. At a press conference last week, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Israel had a sophisticated army capable of operating without inflicting high levels of civilian casualties. He also said an increase in aid was imperative. The US points to Israel’s agreement that it will establish deconfliction sites at UN buildings, which will not be attacked.

"IDF instructions on Gaza refuge zones cruel ‘mirage’, say aid agencies",2023-12-07,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/07/idf-israel-gaza-refuge-zones-cruel-mirage-say-aid-agencies,"Those who have fled to ‘humanitarian zone’ in south-west Gaza bemoan total lack of shelter and barely any food
Instructions from Israeli forces telling Gaza civilians where to seek refuge and humanitarian relief have given contradictory recommendations, while aid agencies and Palestinians who have heeded them describe the offer of safety as a cruel “mirage” amid an intensifying military campaign.
Those who have fled to a “humanitarian zone” declared by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) at al-Mawasi, a Bedouin settlement on sand dunes in the south-west corner of the Gaza Strip, have depicted a desperate scene with no shelter and barely any food. The IDF, meanwhile, has not ruled out bombing the area, claiming that rockets were fired from there, most recently on Wednesday.
Al-Mawasi was first touted as a safe zone a few days after the bombardment of Gaza began in response to the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel in which 1,200 were killed.
However, the IDF has been inconsistent in recommending al-Mawasi as a safe space.
Maps and instructions distributed recently to the 2.3 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza show the territory divided into 623 numbered districts, with orange arrows showing how civilians should move from one district to another to avoid planned IDF military operations.
The arrows have changed direction as circumstances have changed in the past few days, but none of them specifically pointed towards al-Mawasi, nor was the 14 sq km coastal area mentioned in the accompanying text.
Al-Mawasi was however shown in a presentation by the IDF to the international press on Thursday. It appeared as a grey area on a map of southern Gaza, labelled as a “humanitarian zone”.
Asked to give details, Col Elad Goren, the head of the civil department of the IDF’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (Cogat) branch, confirmed the army was recommending it as a haven for Gazans fleeing the war. He also suggested that Israeli forces were putting themselves in danger by allowing the zone to exist, the implication being that it could be used by Hamas to launch attacks.
Goren said: “There are risks, but still we understand that the population needs a solution, so we want to encourage the population to go to this humanitarian zone where assistance will be delivered.”
Gazans who have heeded that advice have described al-Mawasi as dangerously overcrowded and desolate. “To be honest, it’s horrible,” said one man who had fled Jarara, north of Khan Younis, a week ago.
“We believed that al-Mawasi was a safe place, as this is what the Israeli forces told us,” the man said in a recorded voice message, in which the buzz of overhead drones was clearly audible.
The women and girls in his family found a room in a shelter that they were sharing with other families, while the men slept outside in the cold.
“Of course, we barely find food, or anything to eat and drink,” the man said. He added that there was a weekly aid delivery, but it was not nearly sufficient for the crowds that had gathered at al-Mawasi.
“This food in a normal situation wouldn’t be enough for an average family of seven to eight people, but now in this place where we live, there are almost 60 or 70 people, so we struggle. I have to give some part of my food to my son and my wife.”
Pictures of al-Mawasi published by Sky News showed flimsy improvised shelters erected over an expanse of sand strewn with rubbish.
“It is not possible to concentrate large numbers of civilians in such tiny slivers of land without exacerbating an already dire humanitarian catastrophe,” Alexandra Saieh, the head of humanitarian policy at Save the Children International, warned. “People are in overcrowded shelters in makeshift tents. There is no access to clean water, there are crumbling sanitation facilities. We’ve heard of children starving in the so-called ‘safe zone’ of al-Mawasi.”
The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said in a statement: “The UN is not involved in this and has underlined repeatedly that unilaterally declared ‘safe zones’ are not safe at all. Nowhere in Gaza is safe.”
The IDF itself refuses to rule out bombing or other military operations in al-Mawasi, alleging that 12 rockets were launched from the al-Mawasi area on Wednesday.
“I wouldn’t use the words ‘safe place’ or ‘safe haven’ because Hamas fired a rocket from al-Mawasi,” an IDF officer said. “Hamas is using this place for human shields, for its own needs.”
This officer recommended instead that Gazans follow the official map and evacuation instructions, regularly distributed by leaflets, phone texts and social media messages. He said: “Those are changed in accordance to the situation assessment.”
The map accompanying these instructions dividing Gaza into 623 blocks is taken from an Israeli blueprint from the 1970s, Haaretz reported, and was part of a short-lived plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip under Israeli occupation.
The instructions list the names and grid numbers of the districts to be evacuated and those where Gazans are supposed to seek shelter. “Dear residents of Gaza, obeying evacuation instructions is the safest way to preserve your safety, your lives, and the lives of your families,” the IDF text says.
The UN and aid agencies have said that such instructions only add to the peril Gazans face, as movement anywhere is dangerous amid intense urban combat, especially as humanitarian deliveries have completely broken down, creating conditions described by the UN’s top aid official as “apocalyptic”.
“Israel’s safe zones within Gaza are a mirage,” Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s head of policy for the occupied Palestinian territories, said. “They’re unprotected, they’re not provisioned and they’re inaccessible.”
Matthew Miller, the state department spokesperson, said this week that the US was “working with UNRWA to try to identify sites where civilians can go to be safe from harm”.
UNRWA responded in a statement on Thursday: “UNRWA does not have any plans to provide assistance in a ‘safe zone’ but is looking for options for more shelters within the city – not new camps – as its own shelters are overcrowded now.
“As with all its premises, it will share the coordinates with the parties to the conflict, both Israeli authorities and de facto authorities … Some 80 UNRWA premises were already hit during the fighting – some directly.”

UAE asks for UN security council to vote on draft resolution demanding humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza – as it happened,2023-12-08,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/dec/07/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-leader-hiding-underground-idf-says-gaza-aid-system-collapse-news-palestine,"This blog is now closed.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said there a “gap” between Israel’s “intent to protect civilians” in Gaza and what has been happening on the ground.
Blinken, speaking at a news conference in Washington after a meeting with the UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, said: “It remains imperative that Israel put a premium on civilian protection.” He added:
There does remain a gap between, exactly what I said when I was there, the intent to protect civilians and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground.
It’s just past 5am in Gaza and Tel Aviv and this blog is now closing. But first, here is a summary of the events so far:
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said there is a “gap” between Israel’s “intent to protect civilians” in Gaza and what has been happening on the ground. Blinken, speaking at a news conference in Washington after a meeting with the UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, said: “It remains imperative that Israel put a premium on civilian protection.”
Reuters is reporting that Israel has agreed, at the request of the US, to open the Kerem Shalom border crossing for only the screening and inspection of the humanitarian aid delivered into Gaza via the Rafah crossing, a senior US official said on Thursday. But there has been no time frame given for when the crossing might open.
The United Arab Emirates has asked for the UN security council to vote tomorrow on a draft resolution that demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, according to diplomats. The renewed push for a ceasefire, reported by Reuters, was made after the UN secretary general, António Guterres, took the rare step of invoking article 99 of the UN charter on Wednesday to notify the security council that the crisis in Gaza represented a threat to world peace.
The UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, has said there is no longer a functioning humanitarian operation in southern Gaza, saying instead that the aid that is reaching civilians in the territory is “erratic”, “undependable” and “not sustainable”. Speaking at a press briefing in Geneva on Thursday, Griffiths said the pace of the military assault in southern Gaza “is a repeat” of the assault in northern Gaza, and warned that there was nowhere safe for civilians in the southern part of the besieged territory.
Israel’s military has continued its heavy bombardment amid intense fighting in Gaza as its war with Hamas hit the two-month mark. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they had struck about 250 targets in Gaza over a 24-hour period, ending on Thursday morning. At the northern end of the Gaza Strip, there was heavy fighting in the Jabaliya refugee camp.
At least 350 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the course of 24 hours, the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry said in its latest update on Thursday. The cumulative total is 17,177 Palestinian deaths and 46,000 injured since the war began on 7 October, according to the ministry’s tally. About 20 people were killed in airstrikes that hit two homes in the residential part of Rafah in southern Gaza, according to witnesses. Rafah, a town on the southern border with Egypt, is where the IDF has told people to relocate to avoid areas likely to be bombed.
Israeli forces have given contradictory recommendations to Gaza civilians on where to seek refuge and humanitarian relief. Those who have fled to an IDF-declared “humanitarian zone” at al-Mawasi in the south-west corner of the Gaza Strip have depicted a desperate scene with no shelter and barely any food. The IDF, meanwhile, has not ruled out bombing the area.
Joe Biden spoke with Benjamin Netanyahu in a call on Thursday in which the US president “stressed that much more assistance was urgently required” across Gaza, the White House said. Biden “emphasised the critical need to protect civilians and to separate the civilian population from Hamas including through corridors that allow people to move safely from defined areas of hostilities” during his call with the Israeli prime minister, a readout of the call said.
The White House has said Israel and Hamas are not close to another deal on a new humanitarian pause. Discussions are happening “literally every day” on a possible new agreement, the White House’s national security council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday. The Pentagon said the US military has resumed its flights of surveillance drones over Gaza to aid the search for hostages taken by Hamas.
The International Federation of Journalists says 2023 has been an unprecedented year for the number of media workers killed on the job, Associated Press reports. The organisation makes note of the Israel-Hamas war, saying deaths in the war have surpassed those of any conflict in three decades. The group says that 68 journalists have been killed since Hamas’ 7 October attack on Israel, or more than one a day.
And these are some of the latest images coming through of the Israel Defence Forces operating on the border with Gaza, from inside Israel, as well as attending funerals of soldiers.
We have been getting some more images out of Khan Younis as the fighting continues there. Here are some of them:
This is our latest video on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Those who have fled talk about a lack of shelter, water and other services. Watch here:
And here is Julian Borger and Ruth Michaelson’s piece on what aid agencies have to say:
Posts on Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s X account a few hours ago shows him lighting the first Hanukkah candle as Israel begins to mark the start of the Jewish festival. As part of a chain of posts he says “We are currently deep inside the Gaza Strip” and that he’s spoken to US president Joe Biden:
I spoke with @POTUS Biden this evening and I told him: 'We are on the eve of Chanukah.' He told me that he had a menorah in his office. I told him: 'We have a menorah in our heart, for our country and our future.'
The International Federation of Journalists says 2023 has been an unprecedented year for the number of media workers killed on the job, Associated Press reports.
The organisation makes note of the Israel-Hamas war, saying deaths in the war have surpassed those of any conflict in three decades.
The group says that 68 journalists have been killed since Hamas’ 7 October attack on Israel, or more than one a day. They account for 72% of all media deaths worldwide this year, the organisation says.
The group says Ukraine also “remains a dangerous country for journalists” almost two years after Russian troops invaded.
For more on what the US secretary of state Antony Blinken had to say about Israel’s intent to protect civilians in Gaza and the actual results, have a look at this video with his comments, which he gave at a news conference in Washington, after meeting UK’s foreign secretary David Cameron:
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has issued its daily update on the war. It outlines that:
On 7 December as of 22:00, 69 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies and 61,000 litres of fuel entered from Egypt into Gaza. This is well below the daily average of 170 trucks and 110,000 litres of fuel that had entered during the humanitarian pause implemented between 24 and 30 November, and the average of 500 truckloads (including fuel) that entered every working day prior to 7 October.
The update mentions that some people are being evacuated out of Gaza:
On 7 December, 121 sick people and 491 foreign or dual nationals were evacuated from Gaza to Egypt.
The update also outlines and explains the difficulties with aid:
The ability of the UN to receive incoming loads of aid has been significantly impaired over the past few days by several factors. These include a shortage of trucks within Gaza, with some being stranded in the Middle Area, which has been severed from the south; telecommunications blackouts; and the increasing number of staff who were unable to report to the Rafah crossing due to the hostilities.
It also explains the issue with internally displaced people and the conditions being faced as they leave Khan Younis.
Influx of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to Rafah continued on 7 December. Since 3 December, tens of thousands of IDPs have arrived, the majority from across the Khan Younis governorate. Humanitarian actors in Gaza are reporting extreme overcrowded conditions and lack of basic resources in Rafah, where there is no empty space left for people to shelter, not even in the streets and other open areas. Thousands of people wait for hours in large crowds around aid distribution centres as people are in desperate need of food, water, shelter, health, and protection. There are concerns of a breakdown in law and order under these conditions.
Let’s get more on the importance of the Kerem Shalom crossing as we wait to hear confirmation on when it could open. Harriet Sherwood writes in our full report on the Israel-Hamas war:
Israel said it would open the Kerem Shalom crossing to Gaza to inspect humanitarian aid trucks for the first time since the outbreak of the war.
The UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, said there were “promising signs” that the crossing, which carried more than 60% of the truckloads going into Gaza before the war, could be opened soon. “It would be the first miracle we’ve seen for some weeks, but would also be a huge boost to the logistical process and logistical base of a humanitarian operation,” he said.
The west has been pressing for the crossing to be reopened for more than a month to allow more aid into the Gaza Strip, but has met Israeli resistance.
Col Elad Goren, from Israel’s Cogat military liaison to the Palestinians, did not give a date for the opening of the crossing, and said the crossing point would be used to increase the capacity to inspect aid trucks, but not to allow aid into Gaza directly.
Read the rest of Harriet’s update here:
A man has fired a shotgun twice outside a Jewish temple in upstate New York on Thursday, hours before the start of Hanukkah, then said “Free Palestine” as he was taken into custody, police said. No one was injured.
The shots were fired outside Temple Israel just before 2 pm local time and a 28-year-old man was in custody, according to officials. Police did not identify the man, but Gov. Kathy Hochul said he was a local resident, Associated Press reports.
The episode in the state capital of Albany took place amid rising fears of antisemitism worldwide and fallout from Israel’s intensifying war in Gaza, which faces heightened criticism for the mounting Palestinian death toll.
Hochul said she directed the state police and New York National Guard to be on high alert and to increase existing patrols of at-risk sites that were planned for Hanukkah, which begins Thursday evening at sundown.

Melbourne’s Anna Schwartz gallery drops artist Mike Parr after political piece on Israel-Gaza war,2023-12-08,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/dec/08/melbourne-gallery-drops-mike-parr-performance-artist-israel-hamas-war-piece-anna-schwartz,"Gallery owner, who has represented Parr for 36 years, says she was sickened by ‘hate graffiti’ in the work, but denies censoring it and has kept it on display
The Melbourne gallery owner Anna Schwartz has dropped the provocative performance artist Mike Parr after a 36-year relationship, after a piece commenting on Israel’s military action in Gaza.
Schwartz sent Parr a two-sentence email on Sunday, the day after he installed the third part of his exhibition Sunset Claws, informing him she would no longer represent him.
In the work Parr painted black words on a white wall at the Flinders Lane gallery, before obliterating most of the words with blood-red paint and exiting the room weeping.
Among the words Parr said were painted on the wall were “Palestine”, “Israel” and “apartheid”, and a reference to “ethnic cleansing”. It also included the sentence “Hamas raped women and cut off the heads of babies”.
Schwartz said she had ended her association with Parr due to a “serious breach of trust and difference of values”.

“I was sickened by the hate graffiti inscribed on the wall, however I in no way intervened nor censored Sunset Claws, as the full length video of the performance, still playing in the gallery, will attest,” her statement said.
“I have always acted in the interest of the artists represented by the gallery and this is the only time an artist has breached my principles of anti-racism.”
Parr said he “abhorred” antisemitism and people should visit the installation to judge for themselves. It covers both floors of the Melbourne gallery and includes a four-and-a-half-hour video of the performance.
“Anna understands very well the political nature of my performances,” Parr said. “All my performances are controversial, they divide the audience … but that is the point of performance art …
“We’re still a democracy and this is an issue that concerns many in the art world, and many young artists in particular. It’s an issue that they feel inhibited about addressing through their work because they could be in the position that I am now placed … They fear they could be cancelled.
“What Hamas has done in Israel is totally reprehensible and cannot be condoned. But to all intents and purposes 20,000 civilians have now died in Gaza and tens of thousands have been wounded.” (According to the latest figures from the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, the death toll is more than 17,000.)
Saturday’s performance was witnessed  by several people including the cinematographer Gotaro Uematsu, photographer Zan Wimberley and the editor-in-chief of the Saturday Paper, Erik Jensen, who Parr said had agreed to be the artist’s official witness.
The Saturday Paper is published by Schwartz Media, run by Anna Schwartz’s husband, Morry Schwartz. Jensen has also written for the Quarterly Essay, also published by Schwartz.
On Sunday Jensen emailed Parr the notes he took during the performance.
“Yesterday was an incredibly profound experience,” Jensen wrote. “At the end of the performance I found I was crying.”
Parr said he had quarrelled with Morry Schwartz about a week earlier about the situation in Gaza, including coverage of the issue in the Saturday Paper, which Parr said he perceived to be unjustifiably pro-Israel.

“When I told him the Israelis had turned the Gaza Strip into another Warsaw ghetto, he just blew up,” Parr said.
Morry Schwartz, who is the son of Holocaust survivors, said he had argued with the artist but the conversation had nothing to do with the Saturday Paper or its coverage. “From my side it was a conversation, from his, a polemic,” he said.
Both Morry and Anna Schwartz vehemently denied that Morry had anything to do with the decision to end the gallery’s relationship with Parr, and the Guardian does not suggest that he did.
Jensen said he disagreed with any criticism of the Saturday Paper’s coverage, and said he and Parr had never discussed it.
“Our coverage has been scrupulous and impartial,” he said. “I admire Mike enormously as an artist and believe in his work …Mike deals intensely and acutely with the human experience.”
Parr has been exclusively represented by the Anna Schwartz Gallery since its inception in 1986.
Schwartz has been described previously in the media as Australian art’s kingmaker. She represents more than two dozen prominent Australian artists and five of her artists have been selected to represent Australia at the Venice Biennale.
The 78-year-old Parr describes himself as the “gnostic grandfather” of performance art in Australia. His often-confronting performances frequently involve tests of endurance and examine thresholds of pain, attracting considerable media attention over the past four decades. Much of his work is overtly political.
In 2003 he spent 30 hours in a Melbourne gallery with the only arm he was born with nailed to the wall, in protest at the Australian government’s treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.
In 2018 he interred himself in a cavity below a city street in Hobart for 72 hours, partly in protest against the historical atrocities committed against Tasmania’s Indigenous peoples.

Thousands without power in SA and schools closed after storms
Thousands of South Australians have been left without power as wild storms rip through the state, with several schools closed and some hospitals running on backup generators.
The State Emergency Service has responded to 900 jobs across the state, caused mostly by damage from fallen trees. The worst of the weather struck Adelaide early on Monday, with storm activity returning later in the day.
Regional hospitals of Orroroo and Booleroo Centre were running on generators.
SES deputy chief Liz Connell said about half of outback roads were currently closed and teams from the Country Fire Service had come to help:
The overwhelming number of jobs have been call outs for fallen trees which have blocked driveways and roads and have also brought down power lines which are causing thousands of homes to be impacted.

Seven West Media’s chairman, Kerry Stokes, has agreed to pay the costs of Ben Roberts-Smith’s failed defamation action, in a move that will prevent the network from having to hand over thousands of internal documents about the case.
The federal court heard on Monday that Stokes had agreed to pay the costs of the case. Justice Anthony Besanko ordered that Stokes’ private company Australian Capital Equity (ACE) pay them on an indemnity basis.
The order does not state how much Stokes will have to pay, but the total costs of the proceeding are believed to be up to $35m.
In June, Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, failed in his defamation case against three newspapers that he alleged defamed him as a war criminal.
ASX finishes day flat after losing gains
The Australian share market has given up most of its gains to finish about where it started with concerns over the state of China’s economy and its slackening consumer demand.
The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index had been up as much as 0.4% on Monday but finished just 4.1 points higher at 7,199, a gain of 0.06%.
The loss of puff coincided with Chinese markets opening lower after weekend economic data showed a faster-than-expected decline in consumer prices last month.
Capital.com market analyst Kyle Rodda has this analysis:
Deflation is deepening and, while debate rages about why, the trend is undeniable: consumer prices are falling and producer prices have been negative for more than a year.
The data simultaneously indicates anaemic demand and the eroding profitability of Chinese companies.

Aged care facilities fall short of 24/7 nursing goal, audit finds
The National Audit Office has found 88% of residential aged care facilities in September reported having a registered nurse on-site 24/7, falling short of the government’s goal of 100%.
The government has forecast for some time that not all homes would reach the 24/7 figure, citing workforce issues particularly in regional or remote areas with staff shortages.
But in other key areas, the government’s recent aged care reforms are closer to hitting their goals, with care minutes a day and registered nurse care nearly at the required level, according to stats from June contained in a new ANAO report.
Here’s how the audit office put it:
This audit provides early assurance to the Australian Parliament over whether the Department of Health and Aged Care and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission have effectively introduced the mandatory staffing standards.
The department said it welcomed the findings, saying in a response that it was “pleasing to note”.

Government debt now fastest-growing area of spending
Interest payments have eclipsed the National Disability Insurance Scheme as the fastest-growing area of commonwealth spending, AAP reports.
Higher interest rates are making debt more expensive to service and are likely to cost the federal budget tens of billions extra in the years ahead.
The higher cost of borrowing is expected to add up to $80bn more in interest payments over the next 11 years.

Business group welcomes migration plan
One of the country’s biggest business groups, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has welcomed the government proposed changes to immigration.
The group’s chief executive, Andrew McKellar, said:
The creation of a new three-tiered temporary skills pathway will assist employers as they attempt to navigate our currently complex system.
The introduction of service guarantees on visa pathways that target elite talent will help Australia attract highly skilled migrants in sectors like the resources sector, technology, and financial services. This will unleash new innovations, lure foreign investment, and build new industry.
But it wasn’t all positive. McKellar continued to say:
It is however unfortunate that the specialist skills pathway excludes tradespeople from accessing this category – they will be able to come into the country only through the core skills pathway.

The White House says it is “concerned” over new reports that Israel used US-supplied white phosphorus in a bombing attack in Lebanon that injured civilians and burned down houses.
John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council, has just been briefing reporters aboard Air Force One, and was asked about the allegations.
Israel has previously denied it uses white phosphorus, which critics say put civilians at risk of serious and long-term injury, and is banned from use in civilian areas. On at least three occasions, 10, 11 and 16 October, Israel launched attacks in southern Lebanon, with Human Rights Watch posting links to video of “155mm white phosphorus artillery projectiles being used, apparently as smokescreens, marking or signaling”.
Kirby said the Biden administration would be raising the new report with Israel’s government:
We’ve seen the reports, we’re certainly concerned about that. We’ll be asking questions and trying to learn a little bit more.
It’s important to remind that white phosphorus does have a legitimate military utility in terms of illumination and reducing smoke to conceal movements.
And obviously any time that we provide items like white phosphorus to another military, it is with full expectation that it’ll be used for legitimate purposes and in keeping with the law of armed conflict.
It’s after 3:21am in Gaza and Tel Aviv and this blog is now closing. But first, here’s a summary of the key moments today.
Israel’s defense minister Yoav Gallan on Monday said the next phase of the war in Gaza would be lower-intensity fighting against “pockets of resistance” and would require Israeli troops to maintain their freedom of operation, according to the Associated Press. “That’s a sign the next phase has begun,” he said. He’s pushed back against international calls to wrap up the country’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip, saying the current phase of the operation against the Hamas militant group will “take time.” In a briefing with the Associated Press, Gallant refused to commit to any firm deadlines, but he signaled that the current phase, characterised by heavy ground fighting backed up by air power, could stretch on for weeks and that further military activity could continue for months.
The White House said it is “concerned” over reports that Israel’s military is using white phosphorus bombs against target in Lebanon. At a morning briefing, John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the national security council, said use of the highly incendiary substance could legally be used for a smokescreen to conceal military operations, but that the US would seek clarification from Israel about how stocks were being used.
Israel’s defense minister Yoav Gallant gave a fleeting and noncommittal answer when asked at his Monday briefing about reports the country was using white phosphorus in military attacks. The Israeli Defense Forces operate “according to international law”, he said.
Gallant also said Israel had “no intention” of staying permanently in Gaza after the completion of its military campaign to eliminate Hamas. The country was open to discuss alternatives about who will control the territory as long as it is not a group hostile to Israel, he said, and would consider an agreement with Hezbollah in Lebanon if security guarantees were received.
Israel will open the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza on Tuesday in an attempt to speed the security screening of humanitarian aid. A spokesperson for Cogat, the Israeli government department responsible for coordinating activities in the territories, said all aid will still enter via the Rafah crossing in Egypt, but the move to increase screening capacity will double the amount getting in.
European leaders Leo Varadkar of Ireland, Pedro Sanchez of Spain, Robert Abela of Malta and Alexander De Croo of Belgium, wrote to EU president Charles Michel calling for a discussion about a Gaza ceasefire at the union summit on 14 and 15 December. US network CNN said the letter expressed “alarm” over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and questions Israel’s military campaign and its effect on the civilian population.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry updated casualties since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October, stating that 18,205 Palestinians have been killed, and 49,645 injured. The reported death toll has risen by more than 500 in the two days from Saturday, when it stood at 17,700, the ministry said.
Qatar has spoken with Israel to gauge interest in talks about a possible new pause in the fighting in Gaza, according to a journalist for Axios. The report directly contradicts the position of diplomats at the annual Doha Forum conference in Qatar, who have said they are not expecting any reopening of Gaza ceasefire talks for some weeks.
At least 52 people were arrested in Washington DC on Monday at a protest calling for the US to push for a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Activists representing the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, Jewish Voice for Peace and other groups briefly protested in a Senate office building before police ended the demonstration and took dozens into custody.
Italy, France and Germany called on the European Union to impose ad hoc sanctions against Hamas and its supporters. “We express our full support for the … proposal to create an ad hoc sanctions regime against Hamas and its supporters,” they said in a letter to the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell.
France is also considering imposing national sanctions on those involved in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, has said.
Fighting continued on the ground in the Gaza Strip, accompanied by repeated aerial bombardments from Israel. Rockets have also been fired into Israel from Gaza, and from anti-Israeli forces in Lebanon. Some of the heaviest close-quarters fighting in more than two months of conflict took place over the weekend, as the Israel Defense Forces tried to consolidate control of urban centres in northern Gaza and pursued Hamas leaders in the heart of the biggest city in the south, Khan Younis.
Harvard University’s governing board faced mounting pressure on Monday to publicly declare support for, or oust the university president, according to a report by Reuters. It follows remarks she made last week at a congressional hearing on antisemitism.
Israel told the UN that it “must do better” at delivering aid to people in Gaza. The country said it was willing to double the number of inspections, but that “aid keeps waiting at the entrance of Rafah”. Since 7 October Israel has essentially blockaded Gaza, including at times cutting off telecommunications. The Rafah crossing with Egypt is the only entrance or exit to Gaza that has been open with any regularity, and Israel insists on inspecting all cargo being sent into the territory
Read our piece on how the Palestinian Keffiyeh has become a global symbol, by Niloufar Haidari:
Last month, three college students in Burlington, Vermont, were walking home after Thanksgiving – their second in the US, after applying to study abroad from their homes in the West Bank in 2021. According to police, the trio – Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ahmed – were allegedly approached by Jason J Eaton, who, without saying a word, began firing rounds from a pistol at them. Eaton did not know the students; all he could see was that two of them were wearing the keffiyeh, the black and white scarf that has been indelibly linked with Palestinian struggle for over half a century.

It is as the United Nations General Assembly is preparing to vote on Tuesday on an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the two-month-old conflict between Israel and Hamas.
The 193-member General Assembly is likely to pass a draft resolution, Reuters reports, that mirrors the language of one that was blocked by the United States in the 15-member Security Council last week.
Harvard University’s governing board faced mounting pressure on Monday to publicly declare support for, or oust the university president, according to a report by Reuters.
It follows remarks she made last week at a congressional hearing on antisemitism.
The Harvard Corporation, the university’s governing body, has not yet addressed the public backlash Harvard President Claudine Gay received after her testimony, according to Reuters.
The 13-member governing body was due to hold a regular meeting on Monday, according to media reports. A representative for Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.
A petition urging her removal claimed over 1,100 alumni signatures as of midday Monday.
But the Harvard Alumni Association Executive Committee on Monday asked the Harvard Corporation to back Gay, the Harvard Crimson reported. Nearly 700 faculty members signed a petition supporting Gay as of Monday afternoon, while Black alumni and allies said on social media that they had gathered nearly 800 signatures on another petition supporting the president.

Meanwhile, congresswoman Elise Stefanik celebrated the resignation of the president of the University of Pennsylvania in a storm over campus antisemitism, but faced criticism regarding her support for Donald Trump, who associates with antisemites himself.
Referring to Liz Magill, who quit after a stormy congressional hearing last week, and the presidents of Harvard and MIT, who by Monday had not stepped down, Stefanik – the House Republican caucus chairperson – tweeted: “One down. Two to go.”

Our Gaza diary, part 33, details moments in the life of Ziad, a 35-year-old Palestinian living in Gaza:
2am My exhausted brain refuses to stop thinking about all the bad scenarios that I, my loved ones, and all Gazans face if this nightmare does not end soon. I got brief and temporary access to the internet, and I unintentionally saw videos and photos of horrible things Gazans are going through. They made me realise that death could be a merciful fate. Awake and terrified, I knew it was going to be another long night.

It’s 1:33am in Gaza and Tel Aviv. Reged Ahmad here picking up the blog from Richard Luscombe.
Israel’s defense minister on Monday pushed back against international calls to wrap up the country’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip, saying the current phase of the operation against the Hamas militant group will “take time.”
Yoav Gallant is a member of Israel’s three-man war cabinet.
In a briefing with the Associated Press, Gallant refused to commit to any firm deadlines, but he signaled that the current phase, characterised by heavy ground fighting backed up by air power, could stretch on for weeks and that further military activity could continue for months.
“We are going to defend ourselves. I am fighting for Israel’s future,” he said.
Gallant said the next phase would be lower-intensity fighting against “pockets of resistance” and would require Israeli troops to maintain their freedom of operation. “That’s a sign the next phase has begun,” he said.
It’s 1am on Tuesday in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Gaza City. Here’s are the main developments in the Israel-Gaza war:
The White House said it is “concerned” over reports that Israel’s military is using white phosphorus bombs against target in Lebanon. At a morning briefing, John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council, said use of the highly incendiary substance could legally be used for a smokescreen to conceal military operations, but that the US would seek clarification from Israel about how stocks were being used.
Israel’s defense minister Yoav Gallant gave a fleeting and noncommittal answer when asked at his Monday briefing about reports the country was using white phosphorus in military attacks. The Israeli Defense Forces operate “according to international law”, he said.
Gallant also said Israel had “no intention” of staying permanently in Gaza after the completion of its military campaign to eliminate Hamas. The country was open to discuss alternatives about who will control the territory as long as it is not a group hostile to Israel, he said, and would consider an agreement with Hezbollah in Lebanon if security guarantees were received.
Israel will open the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza on Tuesday in an attempt to speed the security screening of humanitarian aid. A spokesperson for Cogat, the Israeli government department responsible for coordinating activities in the territories, said all aid will still enter via the Rafah crossing in Egypt, but the move to increase screening capacity will double the amount getting in.
European leaders Leo Varadkar of Ireland, Pedro Sanchez of Spain, Robert Abela of Malta and Alexander De Croo of Belgium, wrote to EU president Charles Michel calling for a discussion about a Gaza ceasefire at the union summit on 14 and 15 December. US network CNN said the letter expressed “alarm” over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and questions Israel’s military campaign and its effect on the civilian population.
The Gaza health ministry updated casualties since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October, stating that 18,205 Palestinians have been killed, and 49,645 injured. The reported death toll has risen by more than 500 in the two days from Saturday, when it stood at 17,700, the ministry said.
Qatar has spoken with Israel to gauge interest in talks about a possible new pause in the fighting in Gaza, according to a journalist for Axios. The report directly contradicts the position of diplomats at the annual Doha Forum conference in Qatar, who have said they are not expecting any reopening of Gaza ceasefire talks for some weeks.
At least 52 people were arrested in Washington DC on Monday at a protest calling for the US to push for a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Activists representing the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, Jewish Voice for Peace and other groups briefly protested in a Senate office building before police ended the demonstration and took dozens into custody.

Some of the heaviest close-quarters fighting in more than two months of conflict took place over the weekend, as the Israel Defense Forces tried to consolidate control of urban centres in northern Gaza and pursued Hamas leaders in the heart of the biggest city in the south, Khan Younis.
UN security council ambassadors arrived in Egypt to visit the Rafah border crossing. An Egyptian foreign ministry official told the envoys during a briefing: “There is no justification to turning a blind eye to the pain and suffering inflicted on the Palestinian people in Gaza.”
Israel told the UN that it “must do better” at delivering aid to people in Gaza. The country said it was willing to double the number of inspections, but that “aid keeps waiting at the entrance of Rafah”. Since 7 October Israel has essentially blockaded Gaza, including at times cutting off telecommunications. The Rafah crossing with Egypt is the only entrance or exit to Gaza that has been open with any regularity, and Israel insists on inspecting all cargo being sent into the territory.
Israel’s military said 104 members of its forces have been killed in Gaza since the ground operation began. In addition the IDF said 582 soldiers were injured inside the Gaza Strip. It gives its total casualties since 7 October as 433 soldiers killed, and 1,645 wounded.
The mayor of the south Lebanon village of Taybeh, Hussein Mansour, and a family member died when a missile fired by Israel’s military struck his home a few kilometers from the Israel border, a relative and Lebanon’s national news agency told Reuters. The shell did not explode, the relative said, but struck Mansour directly.
A French frigate that shot down two drones in the Red Sea on Sunday was acting in self-defence after coming under attack from the unmanned aerial vehicles, France’s foreign ministry in Paris said on Monday.
Sweden demanded the immediate release of an EU diplomat who has been held in an Iranian jail for more than 600 days and is facing trial on charges of spying for Israel.
More than 200 people blocked entry to the ruling Conservative party’s headquarters in London before delivering an open letter to 10 Downing Street that calls on UK prime minister Rishi Sunak to back a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Here are some more images of the Israel-Gaza war, sent to us over the news wires today:
Four European leaders, Leo Varadkar of Ireland, Pedro Sanchez of Spain, Robert Abela of Malta and Alexander De Croo of Belgium, have written to EU president Charles Michel calling for a discussion about a Gaza ceasefire at the upcoming union summit, CNN reports.
According to the US network, the letter expresses the “alarm” over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. The four have been among the most vocal of Europe’s leaders in questioning Israel’s military campaign and its effect on the civilian population.
“Given the gravity of the situation and the potential of an escalation in the West Bank and regionally, it is imperative for us to hold a serious debate on the war during the upcoming European Council that will take place on December 14 and 15,” the leaders wrote to Michel.
Qatar has been talking with Israeli authorities to see if it has any interest in resuming negotiations over a possible new pause in the fighting in Gaza, according to a journalist for Axios who says he has spoken with two sources in Israel who have knowledge.
The report directly contradicts the position of diplomats at the annual Doha Forum conference in Qatar, who have said they are not expecting any reopening of Gaza ceasefire talks for some weeks.
Axios correspondent Barak Ravid posted a series of messages to his X account on Monday afternoon claiming that he learned from his sources that Qatari mediators “contacted Israel over the weekend”.
Israel, he said, expressed a willingness to engage in discussions as long as any agreement included the release of women still being held hostage by Hamas, as well as elderly, sick or wounded men. There is no way to immediately independently verify the claim.
The official stance of Qatar, as the Guardian’s Patrick Wintour reports, is that negotiations over any new ceasefire are far off and probably would not happen until Israel can point to the killing or capture of some of Hamas’s key leaders as a sign its military operation has achieved its purpose.

The UN general assembly overwhelmingly voted to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.
The resolution for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire passed with 153 members voting in favor, 10 voting against, and 23 abstaining.
The countries that voted against included:
The United States
Austria
Israel
Paraguay
The United Kingdom voted to abstain.
It’s approaching 5.30am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv and we’ll shut this blog shortly. Our live coverage will resume later in the day. Here’s an overview of the latest developments. And you can see all our Israel-Gaza war coverage here. Thank you for reading.
The United Nations general assembly overwhelmingly voted to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The ceasefire resolution passed with 153 members voting in favour, 10 voting against and 23 abstaining. The US, Israel and eight other countries – including Austria, Guatemala and Liberia – voted against the resolution.
The US looked increasingly isolated on the world stage after the UN ceasefire vote, which highlighted the stiffening consensus around the world for the need to stop Israel’s relentless assault on Gaza. In contrast, the previous UN resolution calling for a “humanitarian truce” on 27 October attracted 120 votes in favour and 14 against, with 45 abstentions.
Joe Biden said Israel was starting to “lose support” from the international community due to its indiscriminate bombing in Gaza. The US president added that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu needed to change his hardline government.
Israeli tank shelling on Tuesday was focused on the centre of Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s main city, residents said. Israeli airstrikes there killed 11 Palestinians, including two children, health officials said. Further south in Rafah, bordering Egypt, strikes killed 22 people including children, officials said.
Israeli forces killed six Palestinians in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin on Tuesday, Palestinian health officials said. Five were killed in an Israeli operation in the morning, the health ministry said, while a sixth died later. The Israeli military said it carried out an operation in Jenin targeting an explosives-manufacturing facility on Tuesday and uncovered “explosive devices planted under roads to attack the security forces”.
A senior official from Yemen’s Houthis has warned cargo ships in the Red Sea to avoid travelling towards Israel and the occupied territories, after the Iran-aligned group claimed an attack on a commercial tanker earlier in the day.
US president Joe Biden declined to directly answer a question on reports that Israel was pumping seawater into Hamas’s tunnel complex in Gaza, referring only to assertions that there were no hostages in the areas targeted. Citing unnamed US officials, the Wall Street Journal has reported that Israel recently began pumping seawater into the tunnels in a process that would likely take weeks. Responding in Washington to a question about the reports, Biden said on Tuesday: “With regard to the flooding of the tunnels. I’m not at lib – well, there [are] assertions being made that ... there’s no hostages in any of these tunnels. But I don’t know that for a fact.”
Biden will be speaking to the families of Americans who were taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October, his first in-person meeting with families, Reuters reported, citing a White House official. It is unclear how many families will be present for the Wednesday meeting and how many will be in person versus on video conference.
Palestinians who have been injured during the war in Gaza are facing potentially fatal delays both in getting treatment within the territory as well as in being evacuated abroad, caused by Israeli bureaucracy and military checkpoints, the UN and aid organisations say. The delays come amid a claim by the UN World Health Organisation that Palestinian ambulance staff involved in a recent high-risk evacuation were detained at gunpoint, stripped and beaten by Israeli soldiers.
The Israeli military says it carried out an operation in Jenin targeting an explosives-manufacturing facility on Tuesday.
It said the operation in the West Bank city uncovered “explosive devices planted under roads to attack the security forces”, who subsequently seized weapons, ammunition and more explosives.
The comments, reported by Agence France-Presse, came as Palestinian health officials said Israeli forces killed six Palestinians in Jenin on Tuesday.
An Israeli military statement said of its operation:
The forces identified and dismantled a ready-to-use explosives manufacturing facility and located underground tunnel shafts and an observation control room.
This morning, IDF [Israel Defence Force] drones identified a terrorist cell hurling explosive devices and firing at the forces. The IAF [air force] targeted the threat and killed a number of the terrorists.
The military said “dozens” of arrests were made and operations were ongoing.
Israeli forces killed six Palestinians in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin on Tuesday, Palestinian health officials said.
Five people were killed in an Israeli operation in the morning, the health ministry said, while the sixth was a man who was shot in the thigh and later died after Israeli forces allegedly prevented him from reaching hospital in time, Agence France-Presse reports.
The ministry added that a 13-year-old boy having a separate medical emergency also died after being prevented from reaching treatment.
Earlier reports put Tuesday’s death toll at four.
An AFP photographer saw Israeli military vehicles entering Jenin refugee camp on Tuesday and a drone flying above.
Israeli forces “continue to storm Jenin camp and ambulance crews are prevented from entering to deal with medical cases without prior coordination”, the Palestinian Red Crescent said on Tuesday morning.
The US will always insist on the need to protect journalists reporting from Gaza during the Israel-Hamas conflict, US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said in a letter to Agence France-Presse.
The news agency and other international media groups had written to Blinken in late October urging his help in protecting journalists on the ground in Gaza after several were killed since the outbreak of fighting.
AFP reports Blinken wrote back:
The United States has and will continue to underscore with Israel, and with all countries, that journalists must be protected from harm.
We stand unequivocally for the protection of journalists during armed conflict and mourn those who have been killed or injured.
Since the Israel-Hamas war began on 11 October, at least 63 journalists and media workers – 56 Palestinian, four Israeli and three Lebanese – have been killed, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
AFP and the other media groups also urged Blinken’s help in evacuating their employees from Gaza as Israeli bombards the territory in response for Hamas’s attack.
A senior official from Yemen’s Houthis has warned cargo ships in the Red Sea to avoid travelling toward Israel and the occupied territories, after the Iran-aligned group claimed an attack on a commercial tanker earlier in the day.
Mohamed Ali al-Houthi, the head of Yemen’s Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, said ships should avoid heading towards Israel and that any that passed Yemen should keep radios turned on and quickly respond to Houthi attempts at communication.
Al-Houthi also warned cargo ships against “falsifying their identity” or raising flags different from the country belonging to cargo shipowner.
In solidarity with Palestinians under attack from Israel in Gaza, the Houthis are using their control of Yemen’s western seaboard, including ports such as Hodeidah, to mount attacks on what it regards as shipping linked to Israel.
On Tuesday, the Houthis said they hit a Norwegian commercial tanker with a missile, in their latest protest.
The full report is here:
US president Joe Biden declined to directly answer a question on reports that Israel was pumping seawater into Hamas’s tunnel complex in Gaza, referring only to assertions that there were no hostages in the areas targeted, Reuters reports.
Citing unnamed US officials, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has reported that Israel recently began pumping seawater into Hamas’s vast labyrinth of tunnels underneath the territory, in a process that would likely take weeks.
US ABC News later published a similar report and said the flooding appeared limited as Israel evaluated the strategy’s effectiveness.
Israel’s military said it was looking into the reports, while a defence ministry spokesperson declined to comment.
Responding in Washington to a question about the reports, Biden said on Tuesday:
With regard to the flooding of the tunnels. I’m not at lib – well, there [are] assertions being made that ... there’s no hostages in any of these tunnels. But I don’t know that for a fact.
Biden added:
I do know that, though, every civilian death is an absolute tragedy, and Israel has stated its intent, as I said, to match its words ... with actions.
The WSJ, citing Biden administration officials, has said the flooding could help destroy the tunnels, where Israel believes Hamas is hiding hostages, fighters and munitions.
Other officials expressed concerns the seawater could endanger Gaza’s supply of fresh water, it said.
Australia’s foreign minister says the country supported the UN resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza out of concern for civilians in the besieged enclave, in a rare split with close ally the US.
Penny Wong told a news conference in Adelaide after the UN resolution passed:
Australia has consistently affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself. And in doing so, we have said as Israel must respect international humanitarian law, civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals must be protected.
The resolution we have supported is consistent with the position we have previously outlined on these issues.
Reuters also reports that Australia, New Zealand and Canada – which along with the US and the UK make up the intelligence alliance known as the Five Eyes – released a joint statement on Tuesday backing the ceasefire.
After dire warnings by UN officials over a deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the 193-member UN general assembly passed a resolution on Tuesday calling for a ceasefire, with 153 countries including Australia voting in favour and 23 abstaining.
Ten countries voted against, including the US and Israel, which say a ceasefire only benefits Hamas.
The US was looking increasingly isolated on the world stage after the resounding vote at the UN general assembly calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.
Cheers and clapping echoed around the general assembly chamber in New York as the emergency vote was announced on Tuesday. A thumping 153 member states out of the 193 total membership backed the resolution, with only 10 including the US, Israel and Austria voting against, and 23 – including the UK and Germany – abstaining.
The Palestinians had been hoping for an emphatic result as a demonstration of the unequivocal global desire for an end to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza – and they got it. By contrast, the previous UN resolution calling for a “humanitarian truce” on 27 October attracted 120 votes in favour, 14 against, with 45 abstentions.
The vote highlighted the stiffening consensus around the world for the need for a stop to Israel’s relentless assault on Gaza.
See the full report here:
Further south of Khan Younis in Rafah, which borders Egypt, health officials said an Israeli airstrike on houses overnight killed 22 people, including children. Civil emergency workers were searching for more victims under the rubble.
Residents said the shelling of Rafah, where the Israeli army this month ordered people to head for their safety, was some of the heaviest in days, Reuters reports.
Abu Khalil, 40, a father of six, said:
At night we can’t sleep because of the bombing, and in the morning, we tour the streets looking for food for the children. There is no food.
The UN World Food Programme says half of Gaza’s population is starving.
“There’s no electricity, no fuel, no water, no medicine,” resident Mohammed Obaid said as he inspected debris in Rafah.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said diseases and illnesses including diarrhoea, food poisoning, meningitis, respiratory infections, chickenpox and scabies were spreading.
In Khan Younis, the main city in southern Gaza, residents are saying Israeli tank shelling is now focused on the city centre.
One said on Tuesday that tanks were operating in the street where the house of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza, is located.
Reuters also reports that after nightfall, Israeli airstrikes on Khan Younis killed 11 Palestinians, including two children, health officials said.
An older Palestinian, Tawfik Abu Breika, said earlier that his residential block in the city was hit without warning by an Israeli airstrike that brought down several buildings and caused casualties.
As neighbours sifted through rubble, he said:
The world’s conscience is dead, no humanity or any kind of morals. This is the third month that we are facing death and destruction.
Hamas has welcomed the UN vote demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, Reuters has snapped.
The Palestinian militant group also urged the international community to pressure Israel to abide by the decision.
The UN general assembly resolution for a ceasefire passed with 153 members voting in favour, 10 voting against and 23 abstaining.

Is a new McCarthyism punishing pro-Palestine speech at US universities? Our panel reacts | Panelists,2023-12-13,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/13/israel-gaza-us-universities-free-speech,"Researchers and civil liberties advocates call for safeguarding protected speech amid an uproar over campus activism
Well before the Israel-Gaza war broke out, a new McCarthyism was already widespread on American college campuses. During the Red Scare of the late 1940s and 50s, about 100 professors were fired for supposed communist sympathies; according to Greg Lukianoff, co-author of The Canceling of the American Mind, the number fired for their political beliefs – primarily for conservative or “anti-woke” positions on race and gender – over the past 10 years is almost double that.
It’s only going to get worse, and it is time to sound the alarm. Today, conservatives are using their political power to punish pro-Palestinian speech, including through chilling legislation that conflates support for Palestinian rights with antisemitism and terrorism.
We on the left bear some responsibility for creating the conditions for the political attacks now being waged against our “side”. Cancel culture sets dangerous precedents. Once the idea of punishing “offensive” speech gains acceptance, both on and off campus, anyone with political power can get in the game.
To return to a place of sanity in public debate, we must take the principles of free speech both seriously and literally. I hope that the Gaza war ends as soon as possible, ideally through a durable ceasefire. When that happens, campuses will probably, for better or worse, reoccupy themselves with language policing and culture wars over race, identity, and who ends up where on the hierarchy of oppression.
After being punished themselves, members of the left will be tempted to punish others. Like victims who become victimizers, those who experience cancel culture are often the ones who most fiercely desire retribution. It is a cliche because it is true: an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. In our anger, justified or not, too many of us prefer a world where we are all equal in our blindness, each and every one of us suffering for the sins of the other. This is what must be fought.

The McCarthy era taught us that when campuses engage in ideologically motivated efforts to police student and faculty speech, those efforts not only backfire but severely damage the foundation on which academic communities are built.
The first amendment and the principles of academic freedom require institutions of higher education to safeguard all protected speech – even when that speech is contentious or offensive. As the framers of the constitution intended, and as the US supreme court has reminded us again and again, it is the most controversial, most disfavored speech that makes the first amendment necessary in the first place. Whatever phrases like “from the river to the sea” mean – and whichever side of the current conflict is deploying them – they are constitutionally protected.
That does not mean that colleges and universities are helpless to protect students who are truly under threat. Neither the first amendment nor principles of academic freedom protect speech that contains a serious and imminent threat of violence, an incitement to violence, or speech that pervasively harasses someone based on their race, gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, or other protected characteristics. Educational institutions have an obligation to confront such speech when they see it committed by, or directed at, members of their communities. But banning broad swaths of political speech because administrators, corporate donors, or other powerful people disagree with its message is a recipe for further division, and, in time, further scars and regret.
It’s worth recalling that many of the “subversive” views that were the targets of McCarthy-era censorship on campuses around the country are not even mildly controversial today. In navigating today’s challenges, university administrators must hold fast to the values of learning and free expression that have made our academic institutions flourish, and avoid deploying the easy cudgel of censorship as an ill-fated shortcut to persuasion and mutual respect.

The US Congress, Ivy League universities and other centers of power have been gripped by a ginned-up hysteria aimed at silencing, intimidating and interrogating people and institutions for not being sufficiently pro-Israel. The absurd nature of the allegations being thrown around – including the performative outrage and cynical grandstanding of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who recently berated the heads of several Ivy League schools for ostensibly tolerating antisemitism on their campuses – will surely generate analogies to McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare.
But there are important differences about this moment. Unlike the Second Red Scare, which was a particularly American phenomenon, the intensifying repression against Palestine advocacy isn’t limited to the US but is happening in Canada and across Europe as well. That’s because this hysteria is not a reaction to the debate on American college campuses but rather the product of a calculated and global transnational strategy backed by the Israeli government since 2015.
The Israeli government, having realized that it was failing to deal with growing dissent in global civil society over Israel’s oppression of Palestinians, opted for a securitized policy response that would “go on the offensive”. This included a strategy of working with like-minded partners to exact repressive outcomes in countries in Europe and North America that included the passage of anti-BDS laws, lawsuits aimed at NGOs, smear campaigns and the proliferation of speech codes in the guise of combating antisemitism. Israel realized that its vision of apartheid wasn’t going to win the debate so instead sought to shut the debate down entirely.

A range of so-called watchdog groups have long countered pro-Palestine activity on US college campuses with tactics including aggressive monitoring, blacklisting, and intimidation. These groups are often funded by philanthropic foundations that also support Islamophobic and rightwing groups that share broad goals of smearing Palestinian and Muslim students and professors as antisemites and terrorist sympathizers.
Since 7 October, this dynamic has reached disturbing new heights. The escalation has been compounded by the concurrent rise in antisemitic and anti-Palestinian rhetoric and violence on campuses and beyond, creating an atmosphere of fear and distrust that is fertile soil for an existing campaign of surveillance and harassment targeting Palestinians, Palestinian solidarity groups, and Jews critical of Zionism.
This fraught standoff has been long in the making. As early as the 1980s, prominent pro-Israel organizations such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) were compiling “dossiers” on “anti-Israel” US college campuses and professors. The Israeli government and its supporters have, over the decades, pushed to label almost all criticism of Israel antisemitic. That project has been greatly accelerated by the flawed IHRA definition of antisemitism, which has impoverished our understanding of anti-Jewish prejudice by weighting it toward speech and action about Israel, and heightened the legal and professional risks of pro-Palestinian activism – especially on campuses.
But this chilling effect on higher education, and on free speech more broadly, is not just about Israel-Palestine and pro-Israel groups. It has also been enabled and expanded by a Republican party that is increasingly brazen in its assaults on higher ed. This, too, has been decades in the making, driven by Republicans’ assessment of college campuses as the frontline in the country’s culture wars. Their distrust has spurred outright censorship – banning certain topics in the classroom, for example – and attempts to defund certain programs and departments.
These efforts to use higher ed as a cudgel with which to impose a far-right worldview – or, rather, to excise whatever does not fit into that worldview – is a strategy long favored by authoritarians around the globe. That it should interface so seamlessly with a campaign to vilify critics of Israel – and that anti-Palestinian repression often serves as a model – should come as no surprise.

Gaza: Israeli commanders among nine soldiers killed in Hamas ambush,2023-12-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/13/gaza-israel-soldiers-killed-hamas-ambush,"Senior officer from Golani Brigade dies after failed attempt to rescue injured troops in Shejaiya area
Two senior Israeli commanders and seven other soldiers have been killed by Hamas in a complex ambush in the Gaza City suburb of Shejaiya, an area that has seen intense urban fighting in recent days.
The latest Israeli combat deaths came amid fears of a rapidly escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza as heavy winter rains lashed the region and after reports by aid agencies of dwindling food stocks for the vast number of Palestinians who have been displaced to southern Gaza.
Lt Col Tomer Greenberg, a commander in the Golani Brigade, who had fought against Hamas during its attack on the southern Israel border communities on 7 October, was killed during a failed attempt to rescue four injured soldiers.
In one of the most lethal incidents for Israeli soldiers to date in the two-month-old war in Gaza, Greenberg and several of his senior officers were killed in fighting involving improvised explosive devices while they were fired on from buildings.
Among the dead, announced by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Wednesday, were another colonel, three majors and several members of a combat rescue force.
A notice in Hebrew posted by the Golani Brigade described the ambush which occurred near Shejaiya’s market. “While carrying out searches to clear buildings in the heart of the Shejaiya casbah, considered a crowded area overflowing with terror targets, there was a large explosion in one of the building and several soldiers from the 13th battalion were wounded,” it said.
According to accounts of the battle, the soldiers were approaching a building when they first came under fire from an upper storey, initiating a firefight in which they were struck by grenades and an explosive charge, severely injuring four who were cut off from the rest of the soldiers.
As soldiers went to help the first group amid fears they may be dragged into a tunnel, a second blast hit them. A third group tried to approach to evacuate the wounded and was also hit by an explosion.
The ambush came despite daily claims by the IDF that it is close to having operational control of key Hamas strongholds in the north of Gaza.
Greenberg had risen to public prominence after the 7 October attack, describing in an interview how he had rescued two infant twins whose parents had been killed by Hamas in Kfar Aza.
Referring to the soldiers who were killed on Tuesday, the Israeli minister Benny Gantz said Israel was paying “a heavy, painful, and difficult price”.
The ambush came amid unconfirmed media reports that Israel had started to pump seawater into some of Hamas’s tunnel system. Asked about the claims, made in the Wall Street Journal, the US president, Joe Biden, declined to directly answer, referring only to assertions that there were no hostages in the areas targeted.
“With regard to the flooding … I’m not at lib… well. There are assertions being made that … there are no hostages in any of these tunnels. But I don’t know that for a fact,” Biden said.
Amid growing pressure for a ceasefire, the UN general assembly on Tuesday night passed by a large majority a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. One hundred and fifty-three countries voted in favour of the ceasefire, 10 countries voted against and 23 abstained or were absent.
On Tuesday Israel and the US had their sharpest public disagreement yet over the conduct and future of the war as the two allies became increasingly isolated by global calls for a ceasefire.
The dispute emerged while Israeli forces carried out strikes across Gaza, crushing Palestinians in homes. Biden said he had told the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Israel was losing international support because of its “indiscriminate bombing” and that Netanyahu should change his government, which is dominated by hard-right parties.
The UN general assembly resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire is largely symbolic but serves as an important barometer of world opinion. None of the major powers joined Israel and the US in their opposition to the ceasefire.
Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, will head to Israel this week to discuss with Netanyahu a timetable for the war and what happens if Hamas is defeated. The defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, will travel to Israel next week for a visit that the Pentagon said was intended to show US support for Israel but also to press the need to avoid more civilian casualties in Gaza.
The war ignited by Hamas’s 7 October attack in Israel has already brought unprecedented death and destruction to the impoverished coastal territory, with much of northern Gaza obliterated, more than 18,000 Palestinians killed, according to Gaza authorities, and more than 80% of the population of 2.3 million pushed from their homes.
The US has urged Israel to do more to reduce civilian casualties since it launched its ground invasion of southern Gaza at the beginning of the month. But the toll has continued to mount at seemingly the same dizzying rate.
The healthcare system and humanitarian aid operations have collapsed in large parts of Gaza amid Israel’s blockade of the territory and intense airstrikes and fighting, and aid workers have warned of starvation and the spread of disease among displaced people in overcrowded shelters and tent camps.

Benjamin Netanyahu accused of ‘evil’ campaigning at time of war,2023-12-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/13/benjamin-netanyahu-accused-of-campaigning-at-time-of-war-israel,"Members of his own party among those critical of Israeli PM’s efforts to improve his dire ratings
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been accused of breaking with convention by campaigning while his country is at war after a series of controversial statements in recent days.
A number of senior Israeli political figures have been making moves before what are seen as inevitable elections when the war is over, but Netanyahu’s efforts to improve his dire ratings with the Israeli electorate – many of whom blame him for catastrophic intelligence failures in the run-up to the Hamas attack on 7 October – are regarded as the most blatant.
Netanyahu sparked anger from the left and right on Monday when he said the Hamas attack had led to the same number of Israeli deaths as the Oslo accords, the peace agreement signed between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993. The comments, made in a leaked statement to the Knesset’s foreign affairs and defence committee, were widely seen as being politically oriented.
The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, said in response that it was “impossible to understand the level of detachment and cynicism of a prime minister who is running an evil political campaign at a time like this, the whole purpose of which is to remove responsibility from him, to blame others, to create hatred.”
A senior official in Netanyahu’s own Likud party told the rightwing Israel Hayom newspaper, formerly regarded as a mouthpiece for the PM but increasingly critical of him in recent weeks: “We need to be careful not to sow divisions now. Despite the pervasive view in the Likud that Oslo was a disaster, there are some things that are best not said while half a million troops are inside Gaza and thousands of others are grieving, mourning and worried about their loved ones’ fate in Hamas captivity.”
Another Likud official told the paper: “Netanyahu is in full campaign mode. While the external political threats are gradually increasing, Netanyahu knows that over time the attacks and the calls to remove him will also increase. He has been acting first to win back his base. You can’t in a time of war revert to divisive and inciting talk against a large segment of the public, part of which is in uniform in Gaza, part of which is licking its wounds from the massacre.”
Netanyahu, who doubled down on the same comments in a short video released on Tuesday, has also attempted to bolster his image by suggesting he will not buckle to pressure from the US, after Joe Biden said Israel was losing international support for the war in Gaza and that Netanyahu and his government “need to change”.
Political analysts in Israel anticipate elections next year, and many have expressed the view that Netanyahu’s position will only be threatened further when the most intense stage of the military’s ground offensive in Gaza winds down.
Speculation over whether he can maintain his wartime coalition has been rife. Parties could walk away, potentially collapsing the government.
Dahlia Schiendlin, a political analyst, is among those who see the potential for a crisis being triggered by splits or defections from within Likud or by ultranationalist parties of the far right.
“It is hard to predict in Israel how coalitions end and the specific triggers of coalition collapse,” Schiendlin told the Guardian. “But I would say either it either comes from splits within Likud or from the ultra-nationalist parties.
“What you see in survey research is that 70-75% of Israelis want Netanyahu to resign, with almost twice as many wanting him to go after war than while it is ongoing. With how the war will end and when becoming a more open question … my guess is the number who want him to go sooner will go up.”
That view was echoed by the Netanyahu biographer Anshel Pfeffer. “He knows once Israel scales down its ground offensive in Gaza – almost certainly in a few weeks – he won’t be able to hold back the political flood,” Pfeffer wrote in Haaretz.
“In the not-too-distant future his governing coalition will lose its parliamentary majority and the Knesset will be dissolved. He will try to delay that moment, but his political instincts tell him he will have to fight an election soon – and all the polls are saying he will lose, by a wide margin. So he’s trying to draw up the battle lines of the campaign.”

Gulf states press for two-state roadmap after UN vote on Israel-Gaza war,2023-12-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/13/gulf-states-press-for-two-state-roadmap-after-un-vote-on-israel-gaza-war,"UAE and Qatar say they will not again fund Gaza reconstruction without Israeli concession, as US isolation grows
Gulf states are capitalising on the resounding vote at the UN general assembly in favour of calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza by warning the US they will not once again fund the reconstruction of Gaza unless Israel agrees to a published roadmap to a two-state solution.
In Israel the general assembly vote was dismissed as a further sign of anti-Israeli bias at the UN. But with the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, due to visit the region, pressure is building on Israel to show greater flexibility about what will constitute a military victory and how Gaza will be administered once the war ends.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said he will not permit a role for the Palestinian Authority, led by Mahmoud Abbas, nor countenance a two-state solution. Netanyahu’s defiance led to Joe Biden delivering his most public criticism of Israel yet on Tuesday, urging Israel to avoid an indiscriminate bombing campaign in Gaza and saying Netanyahu should rid his cabinet of its extreme-right ministers.
The United Arab Emirates ambassador to the UN, Lana Nusseibeh, told the Wall Street Journal: “The message is going to be very clear: we need to see a viable two-state solution plan, a roadmap that is serious, before we talk about the next day and rebuilding the infrastructure of Gaza.”
Qatar, which has provided the most cash for Gaza in previous reconstructions, has adopted the same position. The UAE and Qatar would like to see the split between the Fatah party that runs the Palestinian Authority from the West Bank and Hamas, dominant in Gaza, to end.
Biden’s apparently deliberate criticism of Israel at a meeting with party donors may be driven by the sense that US diplomatic isolation is growing, as is opposition to the White House strategy among Democratic voters. But there is no sign that the US is going to end its military support for Israel.
At his meeting with donors, Biden described Netanyahu as a good friend but said he had to change. “This is the most conservative government in Israel’s history,” he said. “[Itamar] Ben-Gvir and co. They are a different kind of bunch. They don’t want any solution with the Palestinians, they just want to punish all the Palestinians.”
At the general assembly on Tuesday, US allies including Australia and Canada that had abstained on a Gaza truce vote on 27 October defied the US and voted in favour of calling for a ceasefire.
In a joint statement, the three nations from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance that voted yes – Australia, Canada and New Zealand – said: “In defending itself, Israel must respect international humanitarian law. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected. We are alarmed at the diminishing safe space for civilians in Gaza. The price of defeating Hamas cannot be the continuous suffering of all Palestinian civilians.”
Tuesday’s general assembly resolution contained a clear call for the release of all hostages and a call for the protection of all civilians but made no direct criticism of Hamas.
Inside the EU, division on the issue continues but the trend away from supporting Israel is apparent. Support for EU sanctions on settlers indulging in violence on the West Bank is also growing.
Biden’s political difficulty in ending the US’s diplomatic isolation is that his chosen vehicle to represent the Palestinians after the war, the Palestinian Authority, has little support among Palestinians or Israelis.
A poll conducted among Palestinians by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, published on Wednesday, found 60% support for the PA to be dissolved. Only 16% said they would vote for Abbas in a presidential election and 60% called for Hamas to take charge.
The Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “There is no one in the world who thinks that Gaza should be handed over to Abu Mazen [Abbas’s nom de guerre] the day after the war.”
There are signs that senior European politicians are investing in the former defence minister Benny Gantz as a potential alternative leader to Netanyahu, testing him out on his vision of Israel’s security postwar. The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, is one of a number of European politicians who have spoken to Gantz in recent days.
A poll for the Maariv news outlet in late November found that Gantz’s National Unity party stood to increase its seats to 43, from only 12 now, in the 120-seat Knesset if an election were to be held soon. Netanyahu’s Likud would slump from 32 seats to 18, it found.
 This article was amended on 14 December 2023 to correct a graphic that previously showed Ireland as having voted against the UN resolution on 12 December.

Israeli ministers block Mossad head’s effort to restart Gaza hostage talks,2023-12-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/14/israeli-ministers-block-mossad-heads-effort-to-restart-gaza-hostage-talks,"Relatives of the abductees say they are shocked, as reports say David Barnea was stopped from visiting Qatar
Israel’s war cabinet has blocked a planned visit to Qatar by the head of the country’s foreign intelligence service that was aimed at kickstarting negotiations over a new hostage release deal.
According to several reports, David Barnea, the head of Mossad, had wanted to travel to Qatar but was blocked by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other cabinet ministers.
The decision prompted demands from the families of hostages for an explanation, saying that they were “shocked” by it.
In a statement they called for an “immediate end to the deadlock in negotiations”, adding they were “at their wits’ end with the indifference and stagnation”. They described the situation as a daily “Russian roulette in which families are informed about the murder of a hostage in captivity”.
While Hamas is still believed to be holding about 138 hostages in Gaza, Israel disclosed earlier this week that 19 of them had been killed. Some were said to have been killed on 7 October and their bodies taken to Gaza, while some had been killed in the coastal strip during their captivity.
In one high-profile incident, a 25-year-old hostage, Sahar Baruch, who was kidnapped from the Be’eri kibbutz on 7 October during Hamas’s shock attack across the Gaza border, was killed during a failed hostage rescue mission by the Israel Defense Forces.
On Thursday it was disclosed that Joshua Loitu Mollel, a 21-year-old agriculture student from Tanzania, who was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz kibbutz, had been killed in captivity.
About 240 hostages, civilian and military, were seized by Hamas on 7 October. While more than 100 hostages were freed during a week-long truce that ended on 1 December, fears have been growing for those still held as Israel has escalated its ground and air offensive in Gaza, amid intense urban combat in a number of key locations.
On Wednesday, families of US hostages in Gaza met the US president, Joe Biden, at the White House. After the two-hour meeting, family members said they believed Biden was making strenuous efforts to secure the release of family members.
Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, who was kidnapped from the Nir Oz kibbutz, said: “We felt before, and we were only reinforced in seeing and believing, that we could have no better friend in Washington or in the White House than President Biden himself and his administration.”
Relations between hostage families and Netanyahu have, however, been more fraught, with an angry meeting between them and the Israeli war cabinet earlier this month during which the daughter of the hostage Chaim Peri, 79, told the Israeli prime minister that those still being held were “living on borrowed time”.
While informal lines of communication between Hamas and Israel, via the mediators Qatar and Egypt, appear to have been kept open since the ceasefire broke down on 1 December there appears to have been little substantive movement, despite reported claims that Israel had approached Egypt with a view to reopening talks.
According to a report in the Qatari-owned outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau reiterated his group’s position that there could be no negotiations as long as fighting was continuing.

Israel reports its heaviest combat losses in six weeks – as it happened,2023-12-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/dec/13/israel-gaza-war-hamas-live-updates-news-un-ceasefire-hostages-us-israel-relations-palestine,"This blog is now closed. See all our Israel-Gaza war coverage here
It’s just turned 5.20am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv and we’re about to shut this blog. Our live coverage will resume later in the day. Here’s an overview of the latest developments. And you can see all our Israel-Gaza war coverage here. Thanks for reading.
The White House went on the defensive over President Joe Biden’s comments to Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel was losing international support because of its “indiscriminate bombing” and that Netanyahu should change his hard-right dominated government. US security spokesman John Kirby was evasive at a press briefing when asked if Biden’s comments were the official position of the US government.
Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant acknowledged the differences with the US but said he was confident the two sides would find a way for Israel’s military operation to continue. Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen said earlier that his country would continue its war in Gaza “with or without international support”.
The Biden administration is delaying the sale of more than 20,000 US-made rifles to Israel over concerns about attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, two sources familiar with the matter have said. The state department sent an informal notification for the sale to Congress several weeks ago but the sale has not gone ahead, despite being cleared by Senate and House committees.
Israel has announced its worst combat losses in six weeks after an ambush in the ruins of Gaza, saying on Wednesday that 10 of its soldiers had been killed over the past 24 hours. Two senior Israeli commanders and seven other soldiers were killed by Hamas in a complex ambush in the Gaza City suburb of Shejaiya, in one of the most lethal incidents for Israeli soldiers during the two-month-long war.
The head of the United Nations relief and works agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said conditions in Gaza were “a living hell”. Philippe Lazzarini told a meeting of the UN global refugee forum in Geneva that his third visit to Gaza since 7 October was distressing. “There is no more food to buy, even for those who can pay. In the shops, the shelves are empty,” he said. Lazzarini’s comments came amid fears of a rapidly escalating humanitarian crisis in the territory as heavy winter rains and cool weather hit.
Israel’s army website was briefly hacked on Wednesday by a pro-Palestinian group that warned of more attacks against Israeli forces, including further cyber-attacks.
Family members of Israeli hostages held in Gaza say they are “shocked” by a report that Israel’s war cabinet has decided against sending the head of Mossad to Qatar for negotiations on a new hostage deal and are demanding an “immediate explanation” from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Times of Israel is reporting.
US president Joe Biden was “moved” by a White House meeting with families of some of the eight US hostages being held by Hamas, said John Kirby, the US security spokesman. Secretary of state Antony Blinken was also present. Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told reporters: “It was a terrific meeting and conversation.”
Discussions over a possible ceasefire hit a dead end, according to a “senior US official” quoted by CNN. The news network said Qatar, which helped broker the previous week-long pause in hostilities that led to the release of more than 100 hostages, had been active in pursuing a new deal but Hamas had “not been responsive”.
A United Nations study said economic cost of the war on Arab neighbours Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan could rise to at least $10bn (£7.9bn) this year and push more than 230,000 people into poverty. The cost for the three states in terms of loss of GDP may amount to $10.3bn, or 2.3%, and could double if the conflict lasts another six months, the UN development program (UNDP) paper reveals.
In case you missed this report from Peter Beaumont and Julian Borger earlier, heavy winter rains have lashed Gaza, washing out tents and flooding some areas, as the head of the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees described deteriorating conditions in the coastal strip as a “living hell”.
Amid escalating shortages of food, spreading waves of communicable disease and the near collapse of Gaza’s health system while heavy fighting continues across the territory, the winter storm turned large areas to mud and drenched many of those sleeping in makeshift plastic tents.
The rapidly worsening humanitarian situation comes as Israel’s air and ground war – after Hamas’s attack on 7 October – has pushed nearly 85% of Gaza’s population from their homes.
Among those caught in the open was Ameen Edwan, camped with thousands of others in the grounds of al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in central Gaza, who said his family had been unable to sleep.
“Rainwater seeped in. We couldn’t sleep,” he told the AFP news agency. “We tried to find nylon covers but couldn’t find any so we resorted to stones and sand” to keep the rain out.
See the full report here:
Israel’s army website was briefly hacked on Wednesday by a pro-Palestinian group that warned of more attacks against Israeli forces, including further cyber-attacks.
In a short letter that covered the main page of the Israeli army website, the group, calling itself “Anonymous Jo”, said the military’s “arrogance and injustice toward our people in Gaza will only harm you through terror, killing and war, whether by land, air or electronically”, Associated Press reports.
The letter went on to call for the “liberation of Palestine”.
The Israeli army confirmed the hack.
Little is known about Anonymous Jo, although the group or individual behind the attack indicated they were of Jordanian origin. One of the lines read:
From your brothers in Jordan to our people in Gaza and Palestine.
Jordan, which borders the occupied West Bank, has a large Palestinian population and the public is very sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinians.
Family members of Israeli hostages held in Gaza say they are “shocked” by a report that Israel’s war cabinet has decided against sending the head of Mossad to Qatar for negotiations on a new hostage deal and are demanding an “immediate explanation” from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Times of Israel is reporting.
It said Israel’s Channel 13 news reported that Mossad chief David Barnea, who helped negotiate last month’s hostage-release deal, had offered to go to Qatar again but the war cabinet decided against sending him amid cabinet disagreements over efforts being made on talks towards a new agreement.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on Wednesday night that “families were shocked by the report on the rejection of the director of Mossad’s request to formulate an agreement for the release of the hostages”, which comes “in addition to the ignoring of the parents’ request to meet with the prime minister and the defence minister, which has not yet been answered”, the Times of Israel reports.
The forum said:
The families demand an immediate explanation from the prime minister and cabinet members and to break the deadlock in negotiations.
Israel has said it believes nearly 140 people remain captive after being seized during Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel.
The Biden administration is delaying the sale of more than 20,000 US-made rifles to Israel over concerns about attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, two sources have said.
Reuters reports the state department sent an informal notification for the sale to Congress several weeks ago. But the sale has not gone ahead, despite being cleared by the leaders of the Senate foreign relations and House of Representatives foreign affairs committees in early November.
A former US official familiar with the sale said on Wednesday:
Other members of Congress became aware of this case, and reached out to the administration to demand they obtain assurances from Israel that the firearms will not go to settlers.
The administration has been engaged with Israel in trying to get satisfactory assurances in that regard prior to formally notifying it. Under the license as drafted, these firearms can also go to Israeli police units about which the department has significant human rights concerns.
The state department did not have a comment on the sale.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Middle East war and has built Jewish settlements there that most countries deem illegal, which Israel disputes.
The Biden administration is specifically worried that some of the rifles could end up in the hands of Israeli settlers, the two sources said.
President Joe Biden and other senior US officials have warned repeatedly that Israel must act to stop settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.
The administration last week began imposing visa bans on people it said were involved in the violence, which this year has risen to its highest level in more than 15 years.
Israeli citizens have said the military army should not back off its unrelenting offensive to crush Hamas, despite the UN general assembly’s ceasefire call, increasing troop casualties and a spiralling Palestinian death toll, Reuters reports.
Israel’s military suffered one of the deadliest days in the two-month-old Gaza war on Tuesday, with 10 soldiers killed, bringing the toll to 115 – almost double the number killed during clashes in the territory nine years ago.
Polls in recent weeks show overwhelming backing for the war despite the rising human costs. Six Israelis who spoke to Reuters on Wednesday said now was not the time back down, regardless of fading global sympathy reflected in Tuesday’s UN resolution.
Hamas’s killing of about 1,200 people on 7 October revived something Israel previously felt when Arabs staged a surprise attack in 1973 – fears that its neighbours and enemies could do away with the Jewish nation all together, political scientist Tamar Hermann said.
The sense of the people is that this is a threat to the very existence of Israel.
Hermann, of the Israel Democracy Institute, which conducts regular opinion polls on the war, said people were prepared for more deaths of soldiers.
Speaking in Jerusalem, retired former IT worker Ben Zion Levinger said Israel’s enemies would view any slowdown in fighting Hamas as a sign of weakness.
If we don’t take this fight to the end, then tomorrow morning we’ll have battles in the north and in the east and the south and maybe Iran. Therefore, we have no choice.
Israel has announced its worst combat losses in six weeks after an ambush in the ruins of Gaza.
Israel said on Wednesday that 10 of its soldiers had been killed over the past 24 hours, including a colonel commanding a forward base and a lieutenant colonel commanding a regiment, Reuters reports.
The toll was an increase of one on the military’s earlier figure and is the worst one-day loss since 15 soldiers were killed on 31 October.
Most of the deaths came in the Shejaia district of Gaza City in the north, where troops were ambushed trying to rescue another group of soldiers who had attacked Hamas fighters in a building, the military said.
Hamas said the episode showed that Israeli forces could never subdue Gaza.
In a televised address, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said any future arrangement in Gaza without Hamas was a “delusion”.
Palestinians seeking safety in overcrowded shelters in Gaza are facing the spread of infectious diseases as well as inadequate food, water and basic services, the United Nations says, renewing calls for a humanitarian ceasefire.
Its post on X (formerly Twitter) came after a top official said a ceasefire was “the only way forward” to help desperate people in need.
Lynn Hastings, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator in the Palestinian territories, said on Wednesday that the war threatened peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis for years or even decades to come
She said the hostilities had pushed almost half of Gaza’s population – or about a million people – into Rafah in the south, compounding the dire health and hunger crisis.

Hastings said:
The reason why Gaza is not safe is not just because of the airstrikes but also because of these conditions created by the massive displacement of the population into smaller and smaller areas.
Hastings also said a ceasefire could be conducive to the release of hostages taken by Hamas during its deadly 7 October attack on Israel and reiterated calls for access to those hostages.
This is Adam Fulton picking up our live coverage – stay with us for the latest developments as they unfold
This is Richard Luscombe in the US handing over the Israel-Gaza war blog to my colleagues in Australia, who will guide you through the next few hours.
It’s 1am Thursday in Tel Aviv and Gaza City. Here’s a summary of what we’ve been following:
The White House went on the defensive over Joe Biden’s eye-raising comments to Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel was losing international support because of its “indiscriminate bombing”, and that Netanyahu should change his hard-right dominated government. John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council, was evasive at a press briefing when asked if Biden’s comments were the official position of the US government, and what changes the US president wanted to see in Israel’s government.
Biden was “moved” by a White House meeting with families of some of the eight US hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, Kirby said. Also present was US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who is leading US efforts to get the hostages released. Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told reporters: “It was a terrific meeting and conversation. We could have no better friend in Washington, or in the White House, than President Biden himself, and his administration.”
Israel’s foreign minister said his country will continue its war in Gaza irrespective of international backing. “Israel will continue the war against Hamas with or without international support,” Eli Cohen said. “A ceasefire at the current stage is a gift to the terrorist organization Hamas, and will allow it to return and threaten the residents of Israel.”
A United Nations study said economic cost of the war on Arab neighbors Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan could rise to at least $10bn (£7.9bn) this year and push more than 230,000 people into poverty. The cost for the three states in terms of loss of GDP may amount to $10.3bn, or 2.3%, and could double if the conflict lasts another six months, the UN development program (UNDP) paper reveals.
The United Nations general assembly overwhelmingly backed an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The assembly passed a resolution with 153 in favor, 10 against and 23 abstentions. The non-binding vote is largely symbolic, but serves as an important barometer of world opinion. None of the major powers joined Israel and the US in their opposition to the ceasefire.
Discussions over a possible ceasefire hit a dead end, according to a “senior US official” quoted by CNN. The news network said Qatar, which helped broker the previous week-long pause in hostilities that led to the release of more than 100 hostages, has been active in pursuing a new deal, but Hamas has “not been responsive”.
Israel’s agency responsible for coordinating government activity in the occupied territories (Cogat) posted to X, formerly Twitter, footage of what it says are Hamas militants seizing a humanitarian aid convoy and firing at civilians. “Gaza deserves better,” it says in the tweet. It is unclear where and when the video was taken.
Two senior Israeli commanders and seven other soldiers were killed by Hamas in a complex ambush in the Gaza City suburb of Shejaiya, an area that has seen intense urban fighting in recent days. In one of the most lethal incidents for Israeli soldiers during the two-month long war, a Lt Col and several of his senior officers were killed in fighting involving improvised explosive devices, while they were fired on from buildings.
The latest Israeli combat deaths came amid fears of a rapidly escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza as heavy winter rains and cool weather hit the region. Aid agencies reported dwindling food stocks for the vast number of Palestinians who have been displaced to southern Gaza.
The commissioner general of the United Nations relief and works agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said conditions in Gaza are “a living hell”. Philippe Lazzarini told a meeting of the UN global refugee forum in Geneva he had returned last night from his third visit to Gaza, which he described as distressing, since the war started on 7 October. “There is no more food to buy, even for those who can pay. In the shops, the shelves are empty,” he said.
The Israeli military carried out a raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian news agency Wafa said seven Palestinians were killed and there were a “number of wounded civilians with various injuries”.
The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, gave her backing to the idea of the EU imposing sanctions on Israeli settlers responsible for attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
Pope Francis renewed his call for an immediate ceasefire, saying “may this great suffering for the Israelis and the Palestinians be over”.
Police in Los Angeles arrested a group of protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza after they shut down a busy stretch of freeway in the city’s downtown, the Guardian’s Dani Aguiano reports.
Dozens of people assembled on the 110 on Wednesday morning, bringing traffic to a standstill during the morning commute for more than an hour. There were tense physical confrontations as commuters attempted to remove people from the road.
The California highway patrol detained 75 people in association with the protest, NBC Los Angeles reported. The demonstration blocked all six southbound lanes of traffic, creating gridlock that stretched for miles.
The US has seen a slew of major protests about the war since the conflict began in October. At least 50 people were arrested in Washington DC on Monday at a protest calling for the US to push for a permanent ceasefire.
In California, hundreds of people assembled outside the office of the US senator Alex Padilla on Tuesday to demand an immediate ceasefire. Last month, a demonstration in Los Angeles shut down a portion of Hollywood Boulevard, while in San Francisco dozens of protesters calling for a ceasefire were arrested after blocking traffic on the Bay Bridge.
Video posted by IfNotNow, the group behind Wednesday’s protest in LA, showed people singing as they linked arms in front of stopped cars while wearing shirts that read “not in our name” and “Jews say ceasefire now”.

Hospitals in Gaza reported an uptick in civilian casualties on Wednesday, Palestinian health officials said.
Al-Nasser hospital in southern Gaza, close to heavy fighting and airstrikes in Khan Younis, gave the names of 45 people killed, CNN reported.
Medical staff at al-Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, also in southern Gaza, said 19 bodies were recovered after two houses in the area were hit by airstrikes, the network said.
Earlier Wednesday, Gaza’s health ministry said at least 18,608 people have been killed and 50,594 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October.
Parts of Gaza were flooded on Wednesday, after a night of heavy rains and strong winds.
The rainwater soaked and damaged the tents of people already displaced by Israeli offensives, exacerbating Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.
At least 85% of Gaza’s population of 2 million have been displaced since fighting started in October, raising urgent concerns about the spread of disease, as well as scarce supplies of water, electricity and food.

Israel tells US it needs ‘months’ to defeat Hamas,2023-12-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/14/israel-tells-us-it-needs-months-to-defeat-hamas,"Defence minister addresses US national security adviser as Biden administration presses for end to war
Israel will fight on until “absolute victory against Hamas”, the country’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told a senior official from the Biden administration, as another minister said the war could last “more than several months”.
Netanyahu’s comments were made to Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden’s national security adviser, during a visit to Israel hours after its defence minister, Yoav Gallant, told Sullivan that many more months were needed to defeat Hamas in Gaza.
A statement from Netanyahu’s office said: “I told our American friends – our heroic fighters have not fallen in vain. From the deep pain of their falling, we are more determined than ever to continue to fight until Hamas is eliminated – until absolute victory.”
Gallant earlier told Sullivan, apparently contradicting bullish daily updates from Israel’s military about the progress of its campaign, that the war “will require a period of time – it will last more than several months”. He said Hamas had “built infrastructure under the ground and above the ground and it is not easy to destroy them”.
Netanyahu met Sullivan and two other senior US officials along with other members of his war cabinet at the headquarters of Israel’s defence ministry, the Kirya, in Tel Aviv.
The comments were also a clear rebuff to the Biden administration, which has been pressing Israel to wind down its offensive, after the US president warned earlier this week that Israel was losing international support.
Before his trip, Sullivan had told a Wall Street Journal event that he would discuss a timetable to end the war and urge Israeli leaders “to move to a different phase from the kind of high-intensity operations that we see today”.
After his meeting with Gallant, Sullivan declined to give details of the talks, but described the conversation as constructive and said there was a “wide degree of convergence” on strategic objectives and steps needed.
Speaking to Israel’s Channel 12 TV station, Sullivan said the Gaza Strip should be brought under a “revamped and revitalised” Palestinian Authority.
Sullivan is set to meet Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah on Friday. A US officials said the two would discuss “ongoing efforts to revamp and revitalise” the Palestinian Authority and reining in “extremist settler violence” against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank
“The Palestinian Authority will look to ultimately have a role [in Gaza], and that is something we are talking about with them,” the official said.
Netanyahu has said there is “disagreement” with Washington over how Gaza would be governed after the war and suggested Israel would retain “overall security responsibility” for the territory.
A poll of Israelis, published on the day of Sullivan’s visit, revealed widespread dissatisfaction with Netanyahu’s handling of US-Israel relations during the war. About 43% disapproved of Netanyahu’s treatment of Biden with 36% supporting, according to a Maariv/Jerusalem Post poll conducted this week.
International alarm is growing at the scale of the death toll in Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, which has already claimed more than 18,000 lives, and the humanitarian catastrophe engulfing the coastal strip where 85% of the population have been displaced by the conflict.
Biden, whose government has provided Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, delivered his sharpest rebuke of the war earlier this week when he said Israel’s “indiscriminate bombing” of Gaza was eroding international support.
He returned to the theme on Thursday, telling reporters: “I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives, not stop going after Hamas but be more careful.”
The US has been pressing for a reduction in airstrikes as well as a major increase in humanitarian aid into Gaza. It has also pressed Netanyahu to explain his vision for how the war will end and how Gaza will be governed.
White House spokesperson John Kirby said that Washington was “not dictating terms” to Israel but that Sullivan had asked “hard questions” about the course of the offensive, while still backing the country.
The meeting came as the UN said on Thursday that hunger and desperation were driving people to seize humanitarian aid being delivered to Gaza, warning of a “breakdown of civil order”.
“Everywhere you go people are desperate, hungry and are terrified,” said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, at a press conference in Geneva.
“We are teetering on the edge of a possible implosion. We might reach our limit. Why? Because there is more and more a breakdown of civil order.”
Lazzarini, who has just returned from Gaza, said he saw people stopping aid trucks to take food and immediately eat it – something he described as “completely new” in the Palestinian territory.
But he said he hadn’t heard of any UN or UNRWA trucks being hijacked by Hamas as claimed by Israel.
As Sullivan began his visit, CNN’s Clarissa Ward became the first foreign journalist to reach Gaza and report independently from the country’s south, apparently accessing the strip from Egypt, which had been blocking journalists from crossing into Gaza.
Israel has allowed journalists to enter Gaza only when embedded with the Israel Defense Forces. Egypt had, until now, acceded in Israel’s exclusion of foreign media.
Despite the bellicose rhetoric from Netanyahu and his ministers, however, pressure is mounting rapidly on Israel.
With many of the 1.8 million displaced people living in makeshift shelters in Gaza’s south amid shortages of food and medicines, and rapidly spreading disease, Washington and other capitals have been increasing pressure on Israel to wrap up major fighting by the end of December.
Sullivan’s meetings in Israel follow the disclosure that the IDF distributed flyers in Gaza offering substantial rewards for information on the whereabouts of Hamas’s top leaders – including a $400,000 (£310,000) price on the head of Hamas’s political leader, Yahya Sinwar, and $100,000 for the capture of its military leader, Mohammed Deif.
The war, now in its third month, began after the Palestinian group’s 7 October attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
In response, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas and launched a relentless bombardment and ground invasion that has left swathes of Gaza in ruins.
This week, the UN general assembly overwhelmingly supported a non-binding resolution for a ceasefire, which Washington voted against.
Underlining the scale of the humanitarian issue facing Gaza, Lazzarini said on Wednesday that Palestinians were “facing the darkest chapter of their history”.
He said they were “now crammed into less than one-third” of the territory, and suggested there could be an exodus to Egypt, “especially when the border is so close”.

Good afternoon. Israel has told the US it needs “months” to defeat Hamas, in a clear rebuff to the Biden administration which is pressing for an end to the war.
Open disagreement has emerged between the US and Israel, with the US also pushing Israel to reduce its airstrikes and significantly increase humanitarian aid into Gaza. In his first phone call with the US president, Joe Biden, since 7 October, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, suggested that the US withdraw its “unconditional support for Israel” to get to a “rapid ceasefire”.
In Germany, a prize granted to leading Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen for political thinking has been withdrawn after they wrote an essay that made a comparison between Gaza and a Jewish ghetto in Nazi-occupied Europe.

MP Layla Moran’s family trapped inside Catholic church in Gaza City,2023-12-16,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/16/mp-layla-morans-family-trapped-inside-catholic-church-in-gaza-city,"‘Beyond desperate and terrified’ relatives among hundreds inside compound amid bombing by Israeli forces
An MP’s relatives have been trapped alongside hundreds of other civilians in a Catholic church in Gaza City since almost the start of the conflict, and the situation has only grown more dire in recent days.
Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford and Abingdon, told the BBC that some of her Christian Palestinian extended family – a grandmother, her son, his wife and their 11-year-old twins – sought refuge inside the Holy Family Church complex after their home was bombed in the first week of the war.
With Israeli forces nearby, Moran said on X that her family has reported white phosphorus and gunfire in the compound, and on Saturday, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two women were shot and killed while walking to a building in the complex known as the Sister’s Convent. Seven others were shot and wounded trying to protect others in the compound, the patriarchate said in a statement.
“No warning was given, no notification was provided,” the patriarchate said. “They were shot in cold blood inside the premises of the parish, where there are no belligerents.”
The generators have also stopped working, making any contact Moran has with her family very short, she said. The patriarchate said that an Israeli tank fired on part of the compound with 54 disabled people inside, causing a fire that destroyed the building’s generator – some are now no longer able to use their respirators.
“They are beyond desperate and terrified,” Moran said on X. “It’s been over 60 days now and it’s just getting worse and worse.”

Last month, another member of Moran’s family – a grandfather – died from not being able to access medical treatment, she said in the House of Commons.
She previously said that the elderly among her relatives could not leave the complex to seek a place of safety while Israel continues to conduct strikes on Hamas targets. Three people in the complex were wounded on Friday in heavy bombing of the area, which destroyed the complex’s solar panels and water tanks, the patriarchate said.
Earlier this week, Moran’s family told her that two men – a bin collector and a janitor – were shot and killed outside the church, their bodies left uncollected. Moran told the BBC that those in the church have received no explanation as to why Israeli forces are targeting their complex.
“I’m now no longer sure they are going to survive until Christmas,” Moran told the BBC.

Israeli airstrikes kill dozens as calls for Gaza ceasefire and hostage talks grow,2023-12-17,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/17/israeli-airstrikes-kill-dozens-gaza-calls-for-ceasefire-hostage-talks-grow-public-anger-hostages,"Fatalities in last 24 hours come amid public anger over mistaken killing of three hostages by Israeli forces
Airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have killed at least 100 people over the last 24 hours, as Israel’s leadership faces growing international pressure for a ceasefire and calls at home to resume hostage negotiations after the Israeli army shot and killed three men kidnapped by Hamas.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory said on Sunday that at least 90 people had been killed by Israeli bombardment in the Jabalia camp in the north, and another 12 had died in bombings in the central city of Deir al-Balah, as fighting was reported in several parts of Gaza.
There are growing signs that civil order is breaking down in the besieged Palestinian territory, which measures about 25 miles (40km) by 7.5 miles and is home to 2.3 million people. On Sunday, dozens of people raided lorries carrying aid after the vehicles entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. Some vehicles appeared to have been guarded by men with sticks, people on the ground said.
About 85% of the population have been displaced from their homes, some multiple times, while food, water, fuel and electricity remain scarce. Aid deliveries through the Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel resumed on Sunday for the first time since the war broke out, although aid agencies have warned that an expected doubling of the amount entering each day – 100 trucks – is still a fraction of what is needed to alleviate the dire humanitarian crisis.
Al Jazeera broadcast footage from the churned-up grounds of the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia, in the north of Gaza, where it said injured and displaced people had been crushed by Israeli tanks overnight on Saturday. At least two bodies could be seen in the rubble and earth. The Israeli army said it had discovered weapons and arrested about 80 Hamas fighters at the hospital, without providing evidence.
A team from the World Health Organization that managed to deliver supplies to Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital on Sunday described the medical complex as a “bloodbath”, with little water and food for the thousands of people using it as a shelter. A spokesperson said the organisation was “appalled by the effective destruction of Kamal Adwan hospital in northern #Gaza over the last several days”, adding: “Gaza’s health system was already on its knees, and the loss of another even minimally functioning hospital is a severe blow.
“Attacks on hospitals, health personnel and patients must end. Ceasefire now.”
Pope Francis on Sunday called for peace, speaking after the Latin patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women at a church compound in Gaza were killed by Israeli sniper fire on Saturday.
Also on Sunday, France joined the UK and Germany in calling for an immediate truce in the 10-week-old conflict, which has killed more than 19,000 people. Israel declared war on Hamas after the Islamist group launched a devastating surprise attack on Israel on 7 October, killing 1,139 people and taking another 240 hostage.
During a visit to Israel, the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, said a ceasefire would allow more aid into Gaza, help secure the release of more hostages and move the parties towards “the beginning of a political solution”.
Paris joins London and Berlin, which also shifted their stances on the conflict on Saturday. The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, and his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, called for a “sustainable” ceasefire and warned: “Too many civilians have been killed.”
The US, too, has been pressing Israel for weeks to scale back operations in Gaza and share solid plans for how the war will end and who it expects to control the area when the fighting stops, while still providing strong military and diplomatic cover. The defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, is the latest in a steady stream of senior US officials expected to visit Israel this week.
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has repeatedly told his US allies that Israel will fight until “absolute victory against Hamas”, while his ministers have said the war could last another several months. Netanyahu has also said Israel will not countenance the possibility of Palestinian governance of Gaza in future.
Netanyahu renewed his pledge to bring back the estimated 129 Israelis still held hostage in Gaza in the face of public anger over the mistaken killing of three unarmed hostages by Israeli troops on Friday.
An Israeli military spokesperson said the shootings of the men, who appeared to have escaped their captors in Gaza City and were carrying a white flag, were against the army’s rules of engagement and were being investigated at the highest level.
In a sign of the anger and dismay, the brother of one of the hostages mistakenly killed lambasted the army for having “abandoned and murdered” him. “Those who abandoned you also murdered you after all that you did right,” said Ido Shamriz at his brother Alon’s funeral on Sunday in the Shefayim kibbutz, north of Tel Aviv, which was attended by dozens of relatives and family members.
Hundreds of protesters thronged outside Israel’s defence ministry in Tel Aviv on what is now a weekly Saturday night protest, demanding the resumption of internationally mediated talks for the return hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The director of the Mossad spy agency, David Barnea, was reported to have visited Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, over the weekend.
During a week-long ceasefire at the end of November, Hamas released 100 hostages, and in return 240 Palestinian women and children were freed from Israeli jails. Israel has rescued one hostage, killed three, and another six have been confirmed by Israeli officials as having died in captivity. A total of 119 soldiers have been killed in the 10-week-old war.
Also on Sunday, Israeli forces said they had uncovered the biggest Hamas tunnel in the Gaza Strip so far, designed to carry carloads of militant fighters from Gaza to the border with Israel. The entryway was said to be just a few hundred metres from the Erez border crossing, raising new questions about how Israeli surveillance missed preparations by Hamas for the its 7 October attacks.
The underground passage formed part of a wider branching network that stretched for more than 4km (2.5 miles) and came within 400 metres of the Erez border crossing, the army said.
It would have cost millions of dollars and taken years to construct, Israeli forces said, and the honeycomb of passageways featured a drainage system, electricity, ventilation, sewage, rails and communications networks.

MP Layla Moran fears family trapped in Gaza church ‘will not survive until Christmas’,2023-12-17,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/17/oxford-mp-layla-moran-fears-family-trapped-in-gaza-church-will-not-survive-until-christmas,"Oxford and Abingdon MP’s extended family among those sheltering in besieged Holy Family church in Gaza City
“I fear my family under siege by Israeli forces in a church in Gaza will not survive until Christmas, between the snipers and the lack of water.”
Those were the stark words of Layla Moran, the MP for Oxford and Abingdon whose extended Christian Palestinian family members are among those who have been trapped inside the Holy Family church complex in Gaza City for 60 days.
“This time next week will be Christmas Eve,” she told the Guardian. “I don’t understand how the Israeli military think this is a good idea. It shouldn’t matter that they’re Christians, but I would ask US president Joe Biden, who himself is a professed Catholic, is this what he would want for his family?”
Moran said her relatives – her grandmother, her son, his wife and their 11-year-old twins – had been seeking shelter inside the church since their home was bombed in the first week of the war, and were now “absolutely terrified” following a week of escalating violence.
On Saturday, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women – named as Nahida and her daughter Samar – were shot and killed while walking to a building in the complex known as the Sisters’ Convent. Seven others were shot and wounded trying to protect others in the compound, the patriarchate said.
On Sunday, the Pope said reports that the IDF had killed the two women were “very grave and painful”. “Unarmed civilians are the objects of bombings and shootings. And this happened even inside the Holy Family parish complex, where there are no terrorists, but families, children, people who are sick or disabled, nuns,” he said.
According to Moran, Israeli forces had since “taken the building opposite the Holy Family church, and there are now snipers at every window with their guns pointing into the church. There’s also a tank that’s taken up position outside. Anyone trying to move around is being shot at, so they’re obviously just not moving.”
She said no one knew why Israel had targeted the compound, though it has been reported that Israeli authorities have claimed that a missile launcher is based in the parish.
“These people have been in the compound for 60 days, so there’s a genuine question of why now, because no one’s really been coming in and out,” Moran said.
“Also, everyone there knows each other. The Christian community in Gaza is tiny. There’s still no suggestion that this has anything to do with Hamas, and it still doesn’t explain why they’re shooting women and children.
“These are innocent civilians, and the Israelis have known that they’re there. I’ve spoken about them at length at various stages, in part because I thought it might protect them. I just don’t understand what’s going on.”
The MP said the siege started last week, when her family reported white phosphorus and gunfire in the compound. An Israeli tank also fired on part of the compound with 54 disabled people inside, according to the patriarchate, causing a fire that destroyed the building’s generator. The complex’s solar panels and water tanks are also said to have been destroyed.
As well as the mother and daughter, Moran said her family told her that two men – a bin collector and a janitor – were shot and killed outside the church. “Everyone can hear the shootings, and my family saw the bullet casings,” she said. “They’re so worried. They literally can’t move. They can’t even leave to go to the toilet, so they’re going to the toilet where they’re sleeping.”
Moran said six members of her extended family originally sought refuge in the complex, but the grandfather died a few weeks ago, in part from dehydration. “He needed hospital treatment and couldn’t get it.”
She’s now concerned the others will not survive either. “Whatever food and water they have now is what they had days ago when this started. I understand that all they’re eating now is biscuits, and they’re soon going to run out.”

The MP, who has been keeping abreast of developments through short, sporadic phone calls, said there were no safe places left in Gaza. “The calculation in Gaza changed after the first month from ‘Where do you want to go to be safe?’ to ‘Where do you want to go to die?’”
A church, she stressed, should have been a place where her family and other Christians could seek sanctuary. “Their calculation was, ‘At least we’re in our city, in our church with people we know and love.’”
Moran said politicians, including Biden, had a responsibility to “raise the alarm with the Israeli government at every possible level” and call for a ceasefire.
“We wouldn’t be in this position if a ceasefire had been reached. To not call for one now would be unconscionable,” she said. “I do welcome what David Cameron has said today, though I don’t understand why it’s taken so long for him to come around to this position.”
The global community, she added, needed to do its utmost to prevent an escalating humanitarian disaster. “International humanitarian law applies to operation by operation. They’re firing on women and children.
“If they survive, I will be getting my family and others to give their testimony to the international criminal court, because that’s the place where justice will be done. But right now there is an immediate situation, and we need as many of them to survive as possible.”

Cardinal condemns ‘cold–blooded’ killing of two women in Gaza church,2023-12-18,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/18/women-mother-daughter-gaza-church-israel-cardinal-vincent-nichols,"Vincent Nichols says shooting of mother and daughter did nothing to further Israel’s right to defend itself
The shooting of a mother and daughter allegedly by an Israeli military sniper in a church compound in Gaza City was a “cold–blooded killing”, the most senior Catholic cleric in England has said.
Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, said the shooting did “nothing to further Israel’s right to defend itself”.
The two women were killed inside the Holy Family parish in Gaza City on Saturday, according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Most of Gaza’s Christian families have taken refuge in the compound since the start of the war.
Nahida Khalil Anton and her daughter Samar were shot as they walked to the sister’s convent, the patriarchate said. One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety.
“Seven more people were shot and wounded as they tried to protect others inside the church compound. No warning was given, no notification was provided. They were shot in cold blood inside the premises of the parish, where there are no belligerents.”
Nichols, who has twice visited the parish, told Sky News on Monday: “This [happened] within what has been clearly designated as a church place, which I cannot believe for a minute has rocket launchers in it [as Israel claims]. It’s a community that, since October, has sheltered hundreds of people and looked after them.”
He added: “It’s certainly a cold-blooded killing. What absolutely puzzles me is that this does nothing to further Israel’s right to defend itself.”
Antonio Tajani, the Italian foreign minister, also criticised Israeli forces on Monday for allegedly shooting and killing people in the church compound, saying such actions would not help in its war to defeat Hamas.
“This has nothing to do with the fight against Hamas because the terrorists are certainly not hiding in Christian churches,” he said.
On Sunday, Pope Francis suggested Israel was using “terrorism” tactics in Gaza as he deplored the killing of the women.
The pontiff said: “Unarmed civilians are the objects of bombings and shootings. And this happened even inside the Holy Family parish complex, where there are no terrorists but families, children, people who are sick or disabled, nuns.
“Some would say, ‘It is war. It is terrorism.’ Yes, it is war. It is terrorism.”
Mark Regev, a senior adviser to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: “We don’t shoot people who are going to church to pray, it just doesn’t happen, that’s not the way the [Israel Defense Forces] operates.”

Responding to Nichols’ comments, he told Sky News an investigation was under way. “Could they have been killed [in the crossfire] by Palestinian terrorists who were shooting at our people indiscriminately? I don’t know.”
He added: “I think the pope and the archbishop are relying on reports that they’ve heard come out of Gaza. Hamas has the guns. People won’t speak out of tune without facing violent retribution – that’s the fact of life in Hamas territory – so one has to be very careful with these reports.”
Relatives of Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, were “under siege by Israeli forces” at the Holy Family church complex, she told the Guardian at the weekend.
Moran said her relatives – her grandmother, her son, his wife and their 11-year-old twins – had been inside the church since their home was bombed in the first week of the war, and were now “absolutely terrified”.
She added that Israeli forces had since “taken the building opposite the Holy Family church, and there are now snipers at every window with their guns pointing into the church. There’s also a tank that’s taken up position outside. Anyone trying to move around is being shot at.”

"Israel’s ‘killing rage’ will fuel conflict for 50 years, warns ex-UK defence secretary",2023-12-18,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/18/israel-killing-rage-fuel-conflict-50-years-warns-ex-uk-defence-secretary-ben-wallace,"Senior Tory criticises war methods in Gaza, saying they pose threat to Israel’s moral and legal authority
The Israeli government’s “killing rage” in Gaza poses a threat to the country’s moral and legal authority and will fuel conflict for another 50 years, the former UK defence secretary Ben Wallace has warned.
In an intervention that goes further than any other front-rank British politician in its criticism of Israel’s methods in the war, the senior Conservative MP wrote in the Daily Telegraph: “Going after Hamas is legitimate; obliterating vast swathes of Gaza is not. Using proportionate force is legal, but collective punishment and forced movement of civilians is not.”
He also criticised Israel’s new generation of “bull in a China shop” politicians for “crashing from one crisis to another”.
International pressure on Israel has been growing over the scale of civilian casualties in Gaza. About 19,000 people have been killed in the course of the Israeli offensive, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory, since the Hamas attack on Israel of 7 October, which killed 1,200 people.
At the weekend the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, joined his German counterpart in calling for a “sustainable ceasefire” in the territory, adding that “too many civilians have been killed”.
Grant Shapps, the current defence secretary, said the approach would mean “hostages released, rockets stop flowing and there’s actually a political process in place to make sure that we get to the day after”.
The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, is due to meet the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, this week to discuss in detail when and how Israeli forces may carry out a new phase of fighting.
American officials envision smaller groups of elite forces who would move in and out of population centres in Gaza, conducting more precise, intelligence-driven missions to find and kill Hamas leaders, rescue hostages and destroy tunnels, US officials said.
The UN security council is also due to vote on Monday on a resolution for a durable and sustainable cessation of hostilities. Cameron defined sustainable as one in which Hamas could not mount further attacks on Israel that threatened its security.
In his Telegraph article Wallace was less interested in the timing of a ceasefire than Israel’s tactics.
He wrote: “We are entering a dangerous period now where Israel’s original legal authority of self-defence is being undermined by its own actions. It is making the mistake of losing its moral authority alongside its legal one.
“I am sure that the shame Benjamin Netanyahu feels for not foreseeing the October 7 attacks is deep, especially for someone who presented himself as a security hawk and tough guy. But perhaps that shame is driving him to lose sight of the long term.
“If he thinks a killing rage will rectify matters, then he is very wrong. His methods will not solve the problem. In fact, I believe his tactics will fuel the conflict for another 50 years. His actions are radicalising Muslim youth across the globe.”
He urged Israel to be more patient and to cultivate moderate Palestinian voices.
An Israeli government spokesperson, Eylon Levy, told the BBC Wallace’s choice of words were “unfortunate language” and that Israel was targeting those who carried out the 7 October attack and was putting in place “unprecedented measures to get civilians out of harm’s way”.
Levy said: “What will radicalise a new generation is if the terrorists who burned people alive, and tortured children in front of their parents, and raped Israeli women and girls, literally get away with murder.”

US defence secretary reasserts support but urges Israel to change tactics in Gaza,2023-12-18,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/18/us-defence-secretary-holds-talks-with-israel-over-gaza-tactics,"Lloyd Austin discusses focus on precise targeting of Hamas leaders; however, UN delays vote calling for cessation of hostilities
The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has held talks with Israeli officials about shifting away from large-scale aerial and ground operations in the Gaza Strip to a new phrase in the war focused on the precise targeting of Hamas leaders.
“Hamas should never again be able to project terror from Gaza into Israel. This is Israel’s operation; I’m not here to dictate timelines or terms,” Austin told reporters after meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his defence counterpart, Yoav Gallant, in Tel Aviv on Monday. He added that protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza was “both a moral duty and a strategic imperative”.
Austin’s comments were followed by remarks from Gallant, who said: “I can tell you that soon we will be able to distinguish between different areas in Gaza … We will continue to operate in Gaza with different levels of intensity, perhaps sooner in the north.” Gallant said the new phase would allow some of the 85% of people in Gaza displaced from their homes to return to the northern part of the strip.
Austin was the latest in a steady stream of senior figures in the Biden administration to visit Israel since the unprecedented attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken as hostages. The trip to Israel is part of a wider Middle East tour, as the conflict in Gaza threatens to spill over into a regional conflagration.
Washington, Israel’s closest ally, has provided intense military and diplomatic cover for the war in Gaza, where the death toll is approaching 20,000, but last week Joe Biden warned that Israel was losing international support because of its “indiscriminate bombing”.
The UN security council postponed a vote calling for a “sustainable cessation of hostilities” to give more time for diplomats to meet US objections to the wording of the draft resolution.
The vote was due late on Monday, but the US said it could not support a call for a “cessation of hostilities”, but might accept reference to a “suspension of hostilities.”
The Arab countries negotiating the text said they had been encouraged to see that the White House was apparently trying to find wording that it could support – as opposed to simply vetoing, as it had done for previous resolutions calling for a humanitarian pause on 18 October and on an urgent humanitarian ceasefire on 9 December.
Divisions within the Biden administration have been growing, with some officials saying the US has underestimated the scale of disillusionment in the global south over perceived hypocrisy in calling out Russian war crimes in Ukraine, but finding a multitude of reasons to justify the large-scale killings of Palestinians in Gaza.
Austin and Netanyahu discussed plans for Israel to switch to more surgical, intelligence-led operations aimed at killing Hamas leaders, destroying tunnels and rescuing hostages, in order to stem the loss of civilian life, the US official said.
“America’s commitment to Israel is unwavering and no individual, group or state should test our resolve,” Austin said in a statement released by Netanyahu’s office.
“I’m also here to discuss how we can best support Israel on a path to lasting security and that means tackling urgent needs first. We must get more humanitarian assistance in to the nearly 2 million displaced people in Gaza and we must distribute that aid better,” he added.
Hamas’s armed wing meanwhile posted a new video message in which three elderly Israeli hostages pleaded for their release.
One man, who identified himself as Haiem Bery, 79, said he was being held in harsh conditions with other elderly hostages suffering chronic illnesses.
“You have to release us from here. It does not matter the cost. We don’t want to be casualties as a direct result of the IDF military airstrikes. Release us with no conditions. Don’t let us grow old here,” he said in Hebrew.
The one-minute video ends with all three men repeating the phrase in unison: “Don’t let us grow old here.”
Bombing in the Jabaliya area in northern Gaza on Monday killed at least 50 people, the health ministry in the besieged Hamas-run strip said; strikes in the same area killed another 110 people the day before. The fierce fighting has made it difficult to transport the dead and wounded to hospitals, residents said.
Conditions in Gaza are dire. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, said on Monday that he “would not be surprised if people start dying of hunger, or a combination of hunger, disease, weak immunity”.
Over the weekend, France joined the UK and Germany in calling for an immediate truce in the 10-week-old conflict, as Israel’s western partners grow uneasy at the devastating human impact of the war.
On Monday, the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said too many civilian lives had been lost in Gaza, repeating the call made on Sunday by his foreign secretary, David Cameron, for a “sustainable ceasefire”.
“Far too many civilians have been killed in Gaza,” the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, posted on X, formerly Twitter. “Certainly, we are witnessing an appalling lack of distinction in Israel’s military operation in Gaza.”
Domestic pressure to resume hostage and ceasefire negotiations is also growing after the Israeli army shot and killed three men kidnapped by Hamas on Friday.
Israeli media reported that the Mossad spy agency chief travelled to Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, over the weekend, and reportedly met Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and the CIA director, William Burns, in Warsaw on Monday.
Doha said there were “ongoing diplomatic efforts to renew the humanitarian pause”. During a week-long truce at the end of November 100 hostages, mostly Israeli, were released in exchange for 240 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails.
After meeting Austin, Netanyahu reiterated “Israel’s commitment to achieve total victory against Hamas”, and his ministers have said the war could last several more months.
The Gaza war could yet spiral into a regional conflict: Israel and Hezbollah continue to exchange fire across the blue line boundary with Lebanon, and several major international shipping companies have announced they are suspending transit through the Red Sea after repeated attacks on vessels by Yemen’s Houthi rebel group. The Houthis say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinian people.
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, more than 300 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, mostly in confrontations with the Israeli army in raids or violent protests.
Also on Monday, the US-based Human Rights Watch accused Israel of the war crime of deliberately starving Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, pointing to statements by senior Israeli officials expressing the intent to deprive civilians of food, water and fuel, and linking the entry of aid to the release of hostages.
The Israeli government hit back at the rights group, accusing it of being an “antisemitic and anti-Israeli organisation”.

Keir Starmer joins Rishi Sunak in calling for sustainable ceasefire in Gaza,2023-12-18,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/18/keir-starmer-joins-rishi-sunak-in-calling-for-sustainable-ceasefire-in-gaza,"Labour leader also reiterates support for ‘two-stage solution’ as ‘the only way this is going to be resolved’
Keir Starmer has joined Rishi Sunak in calling for a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, as the political rhetoric continues to shift away from unqualified support for Israel’s assault in line with moves from the US and others.
Some senior Conservatives were even more explicit. Ben Wallace, a former defence secretary, said Israel’s “killing rage” risked it losing international support, and Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, said she believed Israel had broken international humanitarian law.
The Labour leader said there was a need “to get to a sustainable ceasefire as quickly as possible”, beginning with a pause in the fighting during which the remaining hostages seized by Hamas on 7 October can be freed and aid can enter Gaza.
“It will have to be a political process, to a two-stage solution which, in the end, is the only way that this is going to be resolved,” he said.
The prime minister earlier said Israel had a right to defend itself following Hamas’s massacre of Israeli civilians, but “it must do that in accordance with humanitarian law”.
“It’s clear that too many civilian lives have been lost and nobody wants to see this conflict go on a day longer than it has to,” Sunak said.
“And that’s why we’ve been consistent – and I made this point in parliament last week – in calling for a sustainable ceasefire, whereby hostages are released, rockets stopped being fired into Israel by Hamas and we continue to get more aid in.”
Asked to elaborate on the meaning of a sustainable ceasefire, Sunak’s official spokesperson said it did not mean a demand for Israel to stop its assault on Gaza immediately.
“We do not believe that calling right now for a general and immediate ceasefire, hoping it somehow becomes permanent, is is the way forward. We need the right conditions to ensure that it lasts as long as possible,” he said.
Asked if the prime minister agreed with Wallace’s comments, made in an article for the Daily Telegraph, however, the spokesperson did not reject the former defence secretary’s view.
“We are concerned, as we have set out before, that too many civilians are being killed in Gaza and that their vital infrastructure is being destroyed,” he said.

In a strongly worded article, Wallace said he agreed with Israel’s right to self-defence but that this did not come without limits: “Going after Hamas is legitimate, obliterating vast swathes of Gaza is not. Using proportionate force is legal, but collective punishment and forced movement of civilians is not.”
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was at fault for missing warnings about the Hamas attack, Wallace wrote: “But if he thinks a killing rage will rectify matters, then he is very wrong. His methods will not solve this problem. In fact, I believe his tactics will fuel the conflict for another 50 years.”
Kearns echoed the point, speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World At One: “Hamas is an ideology which recruits into its membership. Bombs don’t obliterate an ideology and neither can a stable state be constructed from oblivion.”

US announces creation of multinational operation in Red Sea after attacks from Yemen’s Houthis – as it happened,2023-12-19,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/dec/18/israel-gaza-war-hamas-live-news-updates-idf-attacks-ceasefire-un-vote-palestine,"This blog is now closed
The UN security council has postponed a vote calling for a sustainable cessation of hostilities to give more time to meet US objections to the wording of the draft resolution.
The vote was due on Monday mid afternoon in New York but the US said it could not support a reference to a cessation of hostilities, but might accept suspension of hostilities.
The Arab countries negotiating the text said they had been encouraged by the US approach which suggested the White House was trying to find some wording that they could support as opposed simply to vetoing resolutions, the position it adopted on a humanitarian pause on 18 October and on an urgent humanitarian ceasefire on 9 December.
Divisions within the US administration have been growing with some officials saying the US is misunderstanding the scale of disillusionment in the Global South over US perceived hypocrisy in calling out Russian war crimes in Ukraine, but finding a multitude of reasons to justify the large scale killings of Palestinians in Gaza.
A range of US diplomats have visited Jerusalem to urge the Israeli government to adopt different military tactics, but with only limited success, and a US support for a suspension of hostilities at the UN, if it happened, would be a signal of US frustration with the Israeli government.
The US has also previously rejected cessation of hostilities resolutions at the 15 strong security council due to the absence of clear criticism of Hamas for its killing of more than 1,000 Israelis, including many women and children on 7 October. The latest draft prepared by the United Arab Emirates simply condemns all acts of terrorism, and calls for all hostages to be released unconditionally.
Pressure has been building on the US after the UN general assembly on 12 December voted by 153 to 10 with 23 abstentions to call for an urgent cessation of hostilities. Permanent members of the security council cannot apply their veto on the General Assembly votes as they can on those held at the security council.
But general assembly votes are expressions of world opinion and do not have the force of law supposedly attached to security council resolutions. In practice many resolutions are ignored.
The sense of US isolation at the General Assembly was a mirror image of the isolation Russia experienced at the Assembly last year over the invasion of Ukraine.
In a bid to win over the British foreign secretary, Lord Cameron, the draft resolution as prepared on Monday had called for a sustainable ceasefire, matching the wording he had used in a weekend article jointly penned with his German counterpart. The wording was designed to make it easier for the UK to move from an abstention, the UK position the last time the issue was debated at the Security Council, to a positive vote in favour.
The UK has on occasion on Middle East issues voted positively for resolutions initially opposed by the US, notably in January 2009 when Gordon Brown instructed the UK envoy to back a UN ceasefire resolution after 13 days of fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The UK stance helped force the US move from opposition to abstention.
A UN call for a suspension of hostilities would in conjunction with other parts of the resolution put pressure on Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza at scale, and by land sea and air. A monitoring process would be established to overcome blockages to aid reaching Gaza.

The vote was due on Monday mid afternoon in New York but the US said it could not support a reference to a cessation of hostilities, but might accept suspension of hostilities.
The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, has announced the creation of a multinational operation in the Red Sea after a series of missile and drone attacks by Yemen’s Houthis. Austin, on a trip to Bahrain after talks in Tel Aviv earlier on Monday, said countries participating in the US-led initiative include the UK, Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Seychelles and Spain.
Yemen’s Houthis were behind two more attacks against commercial shipping in the Southern Red Sea, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement on Tuesday. Reuters news agency is reporting the cost of shipping goods to Israel by sea has risen in recent days as some container lines pull out while others impose new surcharges.
BP has halted all shipments of oil and gas through the Red Sea after a step-up in attacks on cargo ships by Houthi militants. The British oil company said it had paused shipping in the region indefinitely, citing a “deteriorating security situation” amid tensions in the Middle East. BP becomes the first oil company to directly halt its own shipping, after five big shipping firms stopped their vessels passing through the waters between Asia and Africa that connect Asia and Europe.
The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has held talks with Israeli officials including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence counterpart, Yoav Gallant, in Tel Aviv on Monday. The discussions focused on Israel shifting away from large-scale aerial and ground operations in the Gaza Strip to a new phrase in the war focused on the precise targeting of Hamas leaders, the US official said.
The US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington was still not imposing a timetable despite international calls for a ceasefire. “This is Israel’s operation. I’m not here to dictate timelines or terms.”, Austin said.
Israeli forces have forced displaced Palestinian civilians sheltering at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City to evacuate the facility and arrested medical staff, according to reports. Richard Sewell, the dean of the Anglican-run St George’s College in Jerusalem, said most of the hospital’s staff have been detained, while medical sources told Al Jazeera that the hospital is now out of service.
At least 19,453 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the latest tally by the territory’s health ministry on Monday. 52,286 people have been injured, it said. Meanwhile, four Palestinians have been killed on Monday in the Faraa refugee camp, south of the West Bank city of Tubas, in an Israeli military raid, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The armed wing of Hamas, the al-Qassam Brigades, has released a video of three elderly Israeli men being held hostage in Gaza. One man said he was being held in harsh conditions with other elderly hostages suffering chronic illnesses. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the video was “atrocious terror” that “shows the cruelty of Hamas against elderly civilians.”
The Qatari prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, met the heads of the CIA and Israel’s Mossad spy agency on Monday to discuss a potential new deal to secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to reports. But a Palestinian source familiar with the talks told the BBC that negotiations over a new temporary ceasefire “haven’t begun yet”.
The US has raised concerns with Israel after a mother and daughter were allegedly killed by an Israeli military sniper in a church compound in Gaza City, the White House said. The two women were killed inside the Holy Family parish in Gaza City on Saturday, according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Most of Gaza’s Christian families have taken refuge in the compound since the start of the war. The most senior Catholic cleric in England said the shooting was a “cold–blooded killing” that did “nothing to further Israel’s right to defend itself”. The IDF has appeared to deny responsibility for the deaths.
Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of committing a war crime by starving people in the Gaza Strip who continued to face relentless attacks in the war with Hamas militants. “The Israeli government is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in the occupied Gaza Strip,” HRW said in a report. “World leaders should be speaking out against this abhorrent war crime.”
British foreign minister David Cameron will call for increased coordination between allies to address the “desperate” humanitarian situation in Gaza during a visit to Paris and Rome on Tuesday, his office said.
The UK Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has joined the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in calling for a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, as the political rhetoric continued to shift away from unqualified support for Israel’s assault in line with moves from the US and others.
Yemen’s Houthis were behind two attacks against commercial shipping in the Southern Red Sea, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement on Tuesday.
The chemical/oil tanker motor vessel SWAN ATLANTIC was attacked by a one-way attack drone and an anti-ship ballistic missile launched from a Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen … At approximately the same time, the bulk cargo ship M/V CLARA reported an explosion in the water near their location.
This attack is separate from the attack on the M/V SWAN ATLANTIC
There were no injuries reported during either incident, CENTCOM said.
Earlier, the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, announced the creation of a multinational operation in the Red Sea after a series of missile and drone attacks by Yemen’s Houthis.
Meanwhile, Reuters news agency is reporting the cost of shipping goods to Israel by sea has risen in recent days as some container lines pull out while others impose new surcharges, adding to the country’s supply chain pressures amid its war in Gaza.
Israel, whose economy relies on seaborne trade, said in October it would provide compensation for ships damaged due to the war with Hamas, although it has not detailed whether it will cover additional shipping costs.
British foreign minister David Cameron will call for increased coordination between allies to address the “desperate” humanitarian situation in Gaza during a visit to Paris and Rome on Tuesday, his office said.
David Cameron is a former British prime minister who took over the foreign secretary role about a month ago. He said in a statement:
From the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza, to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s brutality in Ukraine, it is more important than ever to strengthen our alliances and make sure our voice is heard
President Emmanuel Macron’s office has said the leaders will discuss Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East, Reuters reports.
Cameron will reiterate his call for a “sustainable ceasefire” in the Gaza Strip, and for increased coordination across European allies to ensure humanitarian aid can get into the enclave, the statement added.
There has been growing concern among foreign governments and international organisations over the civilian death toll in Gaza from Israeli bombardments.
The Israel Defence Forces has posted on X in the last couple of hours a video statement referencing the shooting in Gaza of hostages by mistake, which was announced on Friday. In the video the IDF outlines its view of the challenges of fighting Hamas in Gaza and says that they “conduct our operations as carefully and as professionally as possible”. The video also references how “deviations” from that are investigated.
Israel has come under increasing pressure to protect civilians as well as speed up the delivery of aid to Gaza.
""We do our best to conduct our operations as carefully and as professionally as possible...there may be deviations that require further examination.

The US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington was still not imposing a timetable despite international calls for a ceasefire.
The head of the CIA jetted to Europe for talks with Israeli and Qatari officials on Monday, sounding out the potential for a deal on a new ceasefire.
Neither side elaborated on what needed to change on the ground for a shift to more precise operations after weeks of devastating bombardment and a ground offensive, Associated Press reports.
After talks with Israeli officials Austin said:
This is Israel’s operation. I’m not here to dictate timelines or terms.
Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will keep fighting until it ends Hamas rule in Gaza.
On the possibility of another ceasefire, national security council spokesperson John Kirby said the talks were not “at a point where another deal is imminent.”

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has released its latest update on the situation in Gaza.
Here is what they say about the amount of aid getting into Gaza, both medical and other supplies:
On 16 December, a convoy operated by the World Health Organization (WHO), departing from Rafah, managed to deliver medical supplies for about 500 people in Shifa Hospital, in Gaza city. This is the third humanitarian convoy that has managed to access north Gaza since the end of the humanitarian pause on 1 December. According to the Director-General of WHO, “Gaza’s largest hospital is at the moment able to provide limited trauma stabilization and some dialysis support. Surgery is not yet possible; the hospital has no blood for transfusion, and hardly any staff to care for the constant flow of patients. The hospital needs sustained supplies of medicines, equipment, water, food, fuel, and additional human resources.”
On 16 December, 121 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies and four tankers of fuel entered Gaza, based on initial reports as of 22:00. This is well below the daily average of 500 truckloads (including fuel and private sector goods) that entered every working day prior to 7 October.
It’s 1am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of today’s developments:
Israeli forces have forced displaced Palestinian civilians sheltering at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City to evacuate the facility and arrested medical staff, according to reports.

Prof Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British-Palestinian surgeon who worked at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza for the first weeks of the war, has also reported that Israeli forces have rounded up staff at the facility.
Posting to social media, Abu-Sittah – who last month described horrific scenes at al-Ahli Arab and Dar al-Shifa hospitals while he was there – wrote:
Palestinian hospitals giving any health care, even as a First Aid stations, are being re-targeted by the Israeli army. Yesturday it was Al Awda hospital. Morning they shelled Shifa Hospital. This afternoon they attacked Al Ahli hospital and are rounding up the staff and wounded.

Richard Sewell, the dean of the Anglican-run St George’s College in Jerusalem, said most of the hospital’s staff have been detained, adding that he was “hardly even shocked now” by the “distressing” news.
The hospital, also known as the Baptist hospital, is now out of service, Al Jazeera reported, citing medical sources.
The distressing news just keeps on coming: IDF has forced closure of our Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza and detained most of our staff. Just skeleton staff remains to tend to over one hundred seriously wounded patients. No running water and no electricity. Hardly even shocked now.
The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, has announced the creation of a multinational operation in the Red Sea following a series of missile and drone attacks by Yemen’s Houthis.
Austin, who is on a trip to Bahrain after talks in Tel Aviv earlier today, said countries participating in the US-led initiative include the UK, Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Seychelles and Spain.
In a statement, Austin said:
This is an international challenge that demands collective action. Therefore today I am announcing the establishment of Operation Prosperity Guardian, an important new multinational security initiative.
Hamas is downplaying the discovery by Israel of a tunnel close to a key border crossing in Gaza City, insisting it was done with it anyway.
A Hamas official on Monday said the tunnel had “successfully” accomplished its mission, according to AFP.
The news agency quoted Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, telling a media briefing in Beirut:
The publishing of images of the long tunnel... 72 days after the start of the [Israeli] aggression, came too late. Thanks to this tunnel, the mission that we wanted to accomplish has been carried out successfully.
He did not elaborate on what the mission was.
On Sunday the Israeli army showed images of what it said was the biggest Hamas tunnel uncovered so far under the Gaza Strip, near the Erez crossing between the Palestinian territory and Israel.
The army said the subterranean passage had formed part of a wider branching network that stretched for more than 2.5 miles (4km), and was being used by Hamas in a campaign of terrorism.

John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, has been talking about Israel, and in particular the risk of the war spreading to the northern border with Lebanon, where the exchange of fire between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Hezbollah militia has been escalating.
The Biden administration is reported to have rebuked Israel for firing on Lebanese army positions, but the IDF says Hezbollah has been using those positions to fire rockets across the border. Kirby said:
The continued attacks across that border are of concern to us. We don’t want to see the conflict widened. We don’t want to see a northern front opened up.
We want to keep this conflict focused, as it rightly should be, on Hamas in the wake of October 7. And so we’re in active discussions with our Israeli counterparts about the activities going on up there at the northern border.
Obviously Israel has a right to self defense but we don’t want to see a full on conflict between Hezbollah and in Israel. And of course the attacks that have occurred on the Lebanese Armed Forces are also deeply concerning since [they] are not part and parcel of this conflict, nor do they want to be.
Talking to reporters by Zoom, Kirby also spoke of the shooting death of a mother and daughter in the Holy Family parish in Gaza City on Saturday, allegedly by Israeli snipers:
Unfortunately, it appears that in this case a mother and a daughter lost their lives. And our hearts go out to the families who are grieving their loved ones.
We have raised our concerns about this particular incident with the Israeli government, about the need for those who have injuries or had been wounded, to be able to be safely evacuated so they receive appropriate medical treatment.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) appears to be denying responsibility for the deaths of two Christian women at the Holy Family Parish church complex on Saturday, which we reported earlier.
The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, the Catholic authority in the Holy Land, said the two women, named as Nahida Khalil Anton and her daughter Samar, were shot dead inside the compound by an Israeli sniper.
On Monday, a spokesperson for the IDF issued what CNN said was a “carefully worded""” statement in which it admitted a conversation with the church on Saturday about blasts in the area, but the church had not reported fatalities:
During the dialogue between the IDF and representatives of the community, no reports of a hit on the church, nor civilians being injured or killed, were raised. A review of the IDF’s operational findings support this.
Earlier Monday, the US raised concerns with Israel about the deaths, White House spokesperson John Kirby telling a media briefing: “We’ve been very clear that we believe every effort possible must be made to prevent civilian casualties”.
It’s 10.30pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:

Meanwhile, four Palestinians have been killed on Monday in the Faraa refugee camp, south of the West Bank city of Tubas, in an Israeli military raid, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The armed wing of Hamas, the al-Qassam Brigades, has released a video of three elderly Israeli men being held hostage in Gaza. One man said he was being held in harsh conditions with other elderly hostages suffering chronic illnesses. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the video was “atrocious terror” that “shows the cruelty of Hamas against elderly civilians.”
The Qatari prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, met the heads of the CIA and Israel’s Mossad spy agency on Monday to discuss a potential new deal to secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to reports. But a Palestinian source familiar with the talks told the BBC that negotiations over a new temporary ceasefire “haven’t begun yet”.
The US has raised concerns with Israel after a mother and daughter were allegedly killed by an Israeli military sniper in a church compound in Gaza City, the White House said. The two women were killed inside the Holy Family parish in Gaza City on Saturday, according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Most of Gaza’s Christian families have taken refuge in the compound since the start of the war. The most senior Catholic cleric in England said the shooting was a “cold–blooded killing” that did “nothing to further Israel’s right to defend itself”.
Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of committing a war crime by starving people in the Gaza Strip who continued to face relentless attacks in the war with Hamas militants. “The Israeli government is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in the occupied Gaza Strip,” HRW said in a report. “World leaders should be speaking out against this abhorrent war crime.”
BP has halted all shipments of oil and gas through the Red Sea after a step-up in attacks on cargo ships by Houthi militants. The British oil company said it had paused shipping in the region indefinitely, citing a “deteriorating security situation” amid tensions in the Middle East. BP becomes the first oil company to directly halt its own shipping, after five big shipping firms stopped their vessels passing through the waters between Asia and Africa that connect Asia and Europe.
The UK Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has joined the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in calling for a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, as the political rhetoric continued to shift away from unqualified support for Israel’s assault in line with moves from the US and others.

Leading lights of UK stage call for Israeli release of Palestinian theatre group,2023-12-19,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/19/leading-lights-of-uk-stage-call-for-israeli-release-of-palestinian-theatre-group,"Open letter signed by top playwrights, actors and directors demands Israel free members of Freedom theatre
Some of Britain’s most heralded playwrights, actors and theatre directors have signed an open letter calling for the release of members of a Palestinian theatre group who have been in Israeli custody since 13 December, while also decrying the destruction of cultural sites in the West Bank and Gaza.
Caryl Churchill, Vicky Featherstone, Dominic Cooke and Maxine Peake were among the 1,000 signatories of the letter that called for the immediate release of Mustafa Sheta and Jamal Abu Joas of the Freedom Theatre, whose members were detained after the Israeli army conducted raids in Jenin refugee camp last week.
The Freedom theatre’s artistic director, Ahmed Tobasi, was also taken into custody but released after a day, while Sheta, a producer, and Abu Joas, a theatre graduate, were taken from their homes and detained. The Jenin-based Freedom theatre, founded in 2006, has toured the world extensively – including the UK.
“On Wednesday 13 December, Israeli soldiers attacked the Freedom theatre in Jenin, shooting the building, destroying offices and assaulting its staff,” the letter reads. “The Freedom theatre is a beacon of hope and resilience in the face of inconceivable adversity.
“Our friends and contemporaries at the Freedom theatre deserve the right to carry out their work without fear of violence or persecution.”
The open letter is the second sent from British theatre-makers in recent days. On 15 December, 100 Scottish theatre writers demanded that the staff of the Freedom theatre, which toured to the Edinburgh fringe in 2017, be released. The Royal Court in London, where Featherstone is the artistic director, also released a statement saying it was “horrified to read of the attack on the theatre, destruction of offices and assaults on staff”.
Several Palestinian artists and writers have been killed during the conflict, including Heba Zagout – who died along with two of her children, Adam and Mahmoud, in an Israeli airstrike – and the poet Refaat Alareer. The signatories of the letter call for an end to the violence and criticised the destruction of cultural institutions, including the Rafah Museum and al-Qarara cultural museum, calling attacks on such sites a “clear violation of international law”.
The other demands include the immediate release of Sheta, Abu Joas and all 100 Jenin residents detained on Wednesday; an immediate and permanent ceasefire; an end to the occupation in Gaza; an end to settler expansion in the West Bank; the rightful return of first-generation Palestinian refugees and their descendants.
Last year, Churchill, who is one of the UK’s most celebrated playwrights, was stripped of a lifetime achievement award in Germany because of her support of boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS), and accusations that Seven Jewish Children, her 10-minute play that was written in the aftermath of Operation Cast Lead in 2009 when at least 1,383 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, was antisemitic.
In response, Churchill said: “[The play] is critical of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians; it is not an attack on all Jews, many of whom are also critical of Israeli policy.”
It was also announced on Monday that Stephen Fry would deliver this year’s Channel 4 Alternative Christmas message, using it to call for British Jews to “stand upright and proud in who they are” in the face of “the greatest rise in anti-Jewish racism since records began”.Fry, who will say he “never thought for a single second” he would have to worry about being Jewish in the UK, will point to the 1,350% rise in antisemitic attacks in Britain over the past two-and-a-half months, including “shop windows smashed, Stars of David and swastikas daubed on walls of Jewish properties, synagogues, and cemeteries, and Jewish schools being forced to close”.
He will say he accepts and claims his Jewish identity “with pride”, and calls on viewers to “speak up and call out venomous slurs and hateful abuse wherever you encounter them”.
First airing in 1993, Channel 4’s annual broadcast has served as an alternative to the monarch’s annual televised address on the BBC and aims to bring viewers a message about that year’s events.
In previous years the message has been delivered by a varied selection of presenters, including the whistleblower Edward Snowden, the actor Danny Dyer, and Ameca – one of the world’s most advanced AI robots – last year.

More than 100 container ships rerouted from Suez canal to avoid Houthi attacks,2023-12-20,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/20/more-than-100-container-ships-rerouted-suez-canal-red-sea-houthi-attacks-yemen,"Cape of Good Hope diversion adds 6,000 nautical miles and three or four weeks to delivery times and has driven up oil prices
More than 100 container ships have been rerouted around southern Africa to avoid the Suez canal, in a sign of the disruption to global trade caused by Houthi rebels attacking vessels on the western coast of Yemen.
The shipping company Kuehne and Nagel said it had identified 103 ships that had already changed course, with more expected to go around South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope.
The diversion adds about 6,000 nautical miles to a typical journey from Asia to Europe, potentially adding three or four weeks to product delivery times.
The Houthi rebels, who are aligned with Iran, have said they attacked ships in response to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. Israel is retaliating against an attack by Hamas, which controls Gaza. The US said on Tuesday it would try to lead a naval coalition to protect shipping in the Suez canal.
About 19,000 ships navigate the Suez canal every year, making it one of the world’s key routes, particularly for fossil fuels and goods moving between Asia and Europe.
The ships that had diverted so far had the capacity to carry 1.3m 20ft (6-metre) containers, Kuehne and Nagel said. Oil and gas tankers have also diverted, with BP the biggest company to publicly state that it has done so. Its rival Shell declined to comment.
The disruption has contributed to higher oil prices. The price of Brent crude oil futures, the global benchmark, rose by 1.2% on Wednesday above $80, having fallen below $74 a week earlier. Further price increases could eventually feed through to consumer energy tariffs, adding to inflation.
Michael Aldwell, Kuehne and Nagel’s board member for sea logistics, said: “The extended time spent on the water is anticipated to absorb 20% of the global fleet capacity, leading to potential delays in the availability of shipping resources. Moreover, delays in returning empty equipment to Asia are likely to pose challenges, further impacting the overall reliability of supply chains.”
Companies around the world, including several large carmakers, are monitoring the situation to work out if their supply chains could be affected. The last big unexpected closure of the Suez canal came in March 2021, when the Ever Given container ship blocked passage for six days.

The latest disruption will not affect the retail industry this Christmas, because stocks are built up weeks or even months in advance, meaning products are already in stores or in UK warehouses.
An extended disruption to normal shipping patterns could eventually cause shortages of products for consumers or parts for manufacturers, although few have reported any effects so far.
The disruption has coincided with a period in which many factories shut down temporarily for Christmas, giving some extra time for companies to receive crucial supplies.
Some manufacturers had already switched from “just-in-time” supply chains that relied on goods arriving promptly, to a less efficient – but more resilient – “just-in-case” model with more emergency stockpiles of parts.

Israel is losing the war against Hamas – but Netanyahu and his government will never admit it | Paul Rogers,2023-12-21,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/21/israel-losing-war-against-hamas-netanyahu-idf,"The official narrative has been that Hamas is weakened, but in reality the IDF’s doctrine of massive force is failing
Until recently the war narrative on Gaza has been very largely controlled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the country’s ministry of defence. Israel’s international reputation may have plummeted with the killing of more than 20,000 Palestinians, the wounding of more than 50,000 and the destruction of much of Gaza, but the IDF could still sell a plausible narrative of a severely weakened Hamas, even claiming that the war in northern Gaza was largely complete, and success in southern Gaza would follow before too long.
The narrative was helped by severe difficulties for the few journalists still operating in Gaza, including the risk to their personal safety, while the international press corps was stuck in Jerusalem and dependent on IDF sources for much of their information.
That changed as a different picture began to emerge. First there was a lack of evidence to support the IDF’s claim of a Hamas headquarters under al-Shifa hospital, then the IDF could not identify the location of the Israeli hostages, despite having some of the world’s most advanced intelligence.
Very recently there have been two further incidents. On 12 December, there was a skilful triple ambush staged by Hamas paramilitaries in a part of Gaza supposedly controlled by Israeli forces. An IDF unit was ambushed and took casualties. Further troops were sent to aid that unit, and they were then ambushed, as were reinforcements.
Ten IDF soldiers were reported killed and other seriously wounded, but it was their seniority that counted, including as it did a colonel and three majors from the elite Golani Brigade. That Hamas, supposedly decimated and with thousands of troops already killed, could mount such an operation anywhere in Gaza, let alone a district reportedly already under IDF control, should raise doubts about the idea that Israel is making substantial progress in the war.
A further indication came a few days later, when three Israeli hostages succeeded in getting away from their captors, only to be killed by IDF soldiers, even though shirtless and carrying a white flag. What has since made that worse, and is causing considerable anger in Israel, is that calls from the hostages were picked up by an audio-equipped IDF search-dog five days before they were killed.
There are other, wider indications of the IDF’s problems. Official casualty figures have shown more than 460 military personnel killed in Gaza, Israel and the occupied West Bank and about 1,900 wounded. But other sources suggest far greater numbers of wounded.
Ten days ago, Israel’s leading daily, Yedioth Ahronoth, published information obtained from the ministry of defence’s rehabilitation department. The head of the department, Limor Luria, was reported as saying that more than 2,000 IDF soldiers had been registered as disabled since the conflict began – with 58% of all those it had treated suffering from severe injuries to their hands and feet – suggesting a far higher casualty toll than the official figure. Meanwhile, the Times of Israel has reported the number of injured IDF soldiers, Israel Police and other security forces as 6,125. There have also been a number of friendly fire casualties, with the same paper reporting 20 out of 105 deaths due to such fire or accidents during fighting.
Overall, the IDF is still following the well-rehearsed Dahiya doctrine of massive force in responding to irregular war, causing extensive social and economic damage, undermining the will of the insurgents to fight while deterring future threats to Israel’s security. But it is going badly wrong. Criticism is coming from unexpected quarters, including from the former UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, who has warned of an impact lasting 50 years. Even the Biden administration is becoming thoroughly uneasy at what is unfolding, yet Benjamin Netanyahu and the war cabinet are determined to continue for as long as they can.
It is worth recognising why. The 7 October attacks and the brutality involved struck Israel’s assumption of security to the core, which means that the great majority of Israeli Jews have so far continued to support Netanyahu’s response. Even that, though, is fraying and is made worse by the killing of the three hostages by IDF troops.
An effect of all this is that the IDF commanders are coming under huge pressure to succeed, and will go as far as the war cabinet will allow. Many of those commanders are highly intelligent if inevitably single-minded people, and will now know that for all Netanyahu’s rhetoric, Hamas, or at least Hamas’s ideas, cannot be defeated by military force. They also know that while talks are stalling, pressure from the families of hostages may soon result in another humanitarian pause. Therefore, their aim will be to damage Hamas as much as they can, as quickly as they can, while they can, whatever the cost to Palestinians. For evidence of this approach, witness this week’s intense air raids.
What makes that possible is Netanyahu’s dependence on an extremist minority of religious fundamentalists and trenchant Zionists in his government. They would not have anything like the wider support in Israel were it not for the tragedy of 7 October, yet they are doing more and more harm to Israel’s long-term security. Not only does Israel risk becoming a pariah state, even among its allies, but it will also fuel a generation of radical opposition from a reconstituted Hamas or its inevitable successor.
It needs saving from itself, but that will depend, more than anything, on Joe Biden and the people around him. Perhaps pushed on by the rapidly changing public mood in western Europe, they must recognise their role in bringing an immediate end to this conflict.
 This article was amended on 22 December 2023 to remove an unverified casualty figure for military personnel, and to include an equivalent figure from a different source.

Israeli military accused of targeting journalists and their families in Gaza,2023-12-21,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/21/israel-idf-accused-targeting-journalists-gaza,"Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 68 journalists and media workers killed since 7 October
The Committee to Protect Journalists has accused the Israeli military of targeting journalists and their families in Gaza amid the highest death toll of media workers in any recent conflict.
The New York-based CPJ said at least 68 journalists and other media workers had been killed in Gaza, Israel and southern Lebanon since the Hamas cross-border attack on 7 October and subsequent Israeli assault.
“More journalists have been killed in the first 10 weeks of the Israel-Gaza war than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year,” it said.
“CPJ is particularly concerned about an apparent pattern of targeting of journalists and their families by the Israeli military. In at least one case, a journalist was killed while clearly wearing press insignia in a location where no fighting was taking place. In at least two other cases, journalists reported receiving threats from Israeli officials and Israel Defense Forces officers before their family members were killed.”
The CPJ called for Israel to “end the longstanding pattern of impunity in cases of journalists killed by the IDF”.
Sixty-one of the journalists killed were Palestinian and three Lebanese. In addition, four Israeli journalists were among the 1,200 people, mostly civilians, killed by Hamas in the October attack.
Israel has killed at least 20,000 other Palestinians during the present war, about 1% of the population of Gaza, including more than 8,000 children.
The Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders has warned that “journalism is in the process of being eradicated in the Gaza Strip as a result of Israel’s refusal to heed calls to protect media personnel”.
“Reporters there have no safe refuge and no way of leaving. They are being killed one after another. Since 7 October, the Palestinian territory has been subjected to a veritable eradication of journalism,” it said.
The CPJ said there was a “pattern of journalists in Gaza reporting receiving threats, and subsequently, their family members being killed”. It said the 90-year-old father of the Al-Jazeera journalist Anas Al-Sharif was killed by an Israeli airstrike on his home after multiple threats were made to his son.
“The journalist told Al Jazeera that he had received multiple phone calls from officers in the Israeli army instructing him to cease coverage and leave northern Gaza. Additionally, he received voice notes on WhatsApp disclosing his location,” it said.
The CPJ has previously noted that an Israeli airstrike killed eight members of the photojournalist Yasser Qudih’s family following a report by the pro-Israel pressure group HonestReporting suggesting Qudih and three other Gaza-based photographers had prior knowledge of the Hamas attack on Israel. The Israeli foreign ministry retweeted a claim that “AP, CNN, NY Times, and Reuters had journalists embedded with Hamas terrorists on October 7th massacre”. A tweet by a former Israeli ambassador to the UN and member of parliament, Danny Danon, called for their “elimination”.
“Major media outlets, including Reuters, rejected the claims,” said the CPJ. “HonestReporting subsequently withdrew the accusations, but its report prompted the Israeli prime minister’s office to tweet that the photographers were accomplices in ‘crimes against humanity’, and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to say they should be treated as terrorists.”
Earlier this month, an Al Jazeera camera operator, Samir Abudaqa, was wounded in a drone strike and trapped in a UN school. When people attempted to rescue Abudaqa and take him for treatment, they too were shot. He died of his injuries several hours later.
Human Rights Watch and other groups found that an IDF attack that killed Reuters journalists Issam Abdallah and injured six others in southern Lebanon was probably a deliberate assault by the IDF on civilians.
Israel denies that it targets journalists, saying it only targets Hamas.
Jodie Ginsberg, the CPJ president, called on Israel to be more transparent about the orders given to soldiers in dealing with media workers.
“It’s hard for us to really understand Israel’s attitude. It says that it doesn’t target journalists yet we have this deadly pattern. Because they will not release their rules of engagement, it’s hard for us to know what the terms are in which they’re viewing journalists who are obviously civilians and should never be targeted in war,” she said.
In May, the CPJ released a report documenting a “deadly pattern” of Israeli forces killing journalists even before the latest conflict in Gaza. The group examined the deaths of 20 journalists at the hands of the IDF over the past two decades and “found a pattern of Israeli response that appears designed to evade responsibility”.
“Israel has never put a soldier on trial for an intentional or unintentional killing of a journalist,” the CPJ said.
The US state department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said earlier this week that it had “not seen any evidence that Israel is intentionally targeting journalists”. But Ginsberg said the US has a history of not holding Israel to account for killing journalists.
“Last year, we had the killing of Shareen Abu Akleh, the Al Jazeera journalist who was a US citizen, and again we’ve really seen no accountability. She was killed in what seems to have been a targeted attack because she was shot in the neck between her helmet and her press jacket,” she said.
“We’ve really not seen aggressive action from the US in pushing for an independent investigation or holding Israel to account. The US can do much more in terms of holding Israel to account and particularly in investigating whether or not any of these killings involved US weaponry.”

"More than 8,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails, rights groups say",2023-12-21,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/21/more-than-8000-palestinians-in-israeli-jails-rights-groups-say,"Number held without charge at historic high amid intensified wave of arrests after 7 October attacks by Hamas
More than 8,000 Palestinians are being held in Israeli jails, amid an intensified wave of arrests and detentions in Gaza and the West Bank since the 7 October attacks by Hamas, according to human rights groups.
Addameer, a human rights group supporting Palestinian political prisoners, said the detainees feature hundreds from Gaza, including 123 women, though the true total from the territory could be much higher.
Earlier this month the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club, an advocacy group that keeps a tally of detainees from the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, said there were about 7,800 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, the highest total for at least 14 years.
The numbers for those held in administrative detention – indefinitely and without charge – is at a historic high, campaigners said. Eighty per cent of detainees since 7 October fall into this category, said Tala Nasir, a lawyer working with Addameer.
Earlier this month images leaked of Israeli troops overseeing dozens of Palestinian men detained in Gaza, stripped to their underwear and in some cases blindfolded and handcuffed. On Tuesday the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that hundreds of the men were being held at a military base in the south of Israel, and that several had died in unclear circumstances.
In response to questions about alleged mistreatment, the Israeli military said that detainees were “treated according to protocol” and were given enough food and water. The army spokesperson, R Adm Daniel Hagari, said that arrests took place in two Hamas strongholds in northern Gaza and that detainees were told to strip to make sure they had not concealed explosives.
Hagari said the men were questioned and those believed to have ties to Hamas taken away for further interrogation.
Former Israeli officials said the tactic was necessary.
“This is already helping us, and it will be crucial for the next stage of the war,” said Yaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser to the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. “That’s the stage where we clean areas from all the remnants of Hamas.”
During the weeklong ceasefire which ended on 1 December, Israel released 240 Palestinian minors and women from its jails in return for 80 Israeli hostages seized by Hamas during the attacks into southern Israel, which also killed 1,200, mostly civilians. Israel’s ensuing offensive in Gaza has killed more than 18,700 people, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian officials.
Most of the 14- to 17-year-olds freed had been detained for investigation and not convicted of a crime, reported the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club, based on data from the Israeli Prison Service. Over that same week, Israel arrested 260 other Palestinians, leading to a net increase in the number of prisoners, the group said.
The pace of Israeli arrests of Palestinians – already quickening over the past two years – accelerated after Hamas’ 7 October attacks. Many observers say Israel’s systematic use of administrative detention is a violation of international law. Israeli officials said the measures are necessary to protect its population from terrorist attacks.
Ibrahim Dalalsha, an analyst at the Horizon Centre in Ramallah, said the new wave of arrests did not appear to be based on specific intelligence.
“Usually the Israelis are going after people who are likely to commit or have committed offences after having a specific tip or information … This time they have gone after all people: different types of activists, their relatives, municipal workers. It’s pre-emptive kind of arrest and very broad,” Dalalsha said.
“The impact has to be considered in a broader context of other collective measures used in the West Bank in ways that have not been used for some time … This is punishment because we are Palestinians, not because we are a threat.”
The vast majority of Palestinians detained, experts say, are teenage boys and young men accused of throwing stones and firebombs or associating with militants. Some are released relatively swiftly. Many spend several months or longer in harsh conditions behind bars.
The conviction rate for security offences in the West Bank is more than 99%. Campaigners say detainees are often unable to read Hebrew-language statements or other documents, even confessions, and defence lawyers encourage young clients to plead guilty to avoid lengthy trials and detentions.
Lawyers say the crackdown is indiscriminate, with people branded as security threats for even mild social media posts.
Within the span of two months, six Palestinian men have died in Israeli custody, the highest number of cases in such a short period in decades, the UN said.
Nasir said Addameer had tried to establish what had happened in these cases. None of those who died had pre-existing medical conditions, she said, and a leaked autopsy revealed that one had sustained multiple injuries before dying.
Two weeks ago, the UN human rights office in the occupied Palestinian territory called for all deaths in custody and allegations of mistreatment to be investigated.
“The massive rise in number of Palestinians arrested and detained, the number of reports of ill-treatment and humiliation suffered by those in custody, and the reported failure to adhere to basic due process raise serious questions about Israel’s compliance with international humanitarian law and international human rights law,” it said.
Israel’s Prison Service has said that all prisoners in its custody “are detained according to the provisions of the law” and that prisoners deaths were under investigation.
Fast-tracked legislation pushed by Israel’s hardline national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, means that since 7 October, prisoners have been subject to a “state of emergency”, allowing them to be confined to their cells and so unable to receive family visits or buy food. They also face more frequent surprise searches, and electricity for devices has been cut off.
Some of those released during the ceasefire last month described beatings, deprivation and a significant deterioration in conditions in Israeli jails after the 7 October attacks.
Muhammad Ghazi Nazzal was arrested on 24 August and held in administrative detention for six months without any charges.
The 18-year-old described jailers entering cells in the middle of the night to beat prisoners, and scarce food. There was no independent confirmation, though pictures of injuries and medical documents seen by the Guardian support Nazzal’s claims.
“Approximately 10 people were served sliced ​​bread, either one, two or three loaves for all the prisoners,” Nazzal said.
Nazzal said he was assaulted and hit on the hands, breaking his fingers. Though examined by a doctor who recommended treatment in a hospital, nothing was done until he was released and taken to Ramallah hospital.
“My joy was incomplete. I wanted to hug my mother and father, but because of the pain and fractures, I could not, and my mother cried a lot when she saw my health condition. I lost more than 10kg of weight,” he said.
The Israeli Prison Service said Palestinians are detained according to law and had the right to file complaints over conditions. Palestinians say their complaints are not taken seriously and rarely yield results.
The West Bank has been under Israeli military rule since Israel captured the territory in the six-day war in 1967. The Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state.
The territory’s nearly 3 million Palestinian residents are subject to Israel’s military justice system, while the nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers living alongside them have Israeli citizenship and are subject to civilian courts.
“The crackdown in a way contradicts our intention not to open another front in the West Bank,” said Ami Ayalon, former director of Israel’s Shin Bet security service. “On one hand, we understand the more people killed and arrested, the more hatred rises. But on the other hand, we don’t want to pay the price in terrorist attacks.”

"Gaza faces ‘highest ever recorded’ levels of food insecurity, UN warns",2023-12-21,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/21/hamas-rejects-hostage-talks-as-un-declares-catastrophic-hunger-in-gaza,"Territory hit by ‘catastrophic’ hunger crisis while resolution for aid flows remains mired in disagreement at security council
Gaza is facing a “catastrophic” hunger crisis of unprecedented proportions, according to the UN, with everyone in the besieged coastal strip liable to face acute food insecurity in the coming weeks.
At the same time, hopes of a temporary pause in fighting to allow a new prisoner exchange receded as Hamas rejected talks until Israel halted its military onslaught on Gaza. On Thursday night, the US said it could support an amended version of a UN resolution aimed at increasing aid flows into Gaza, but only after a call for “an urgent suspension of hostilities” was removed.
A vote on the amended resolution was put off until Friday, and it was not confirmed that all the other 14 council members, particularly Russia would vote for the amended version.
Amid continuing alarm about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the UN declared “catastrophic” hunger levels, with thousands of people at risk of famine.
A report by the UN and food security agencies said four out of five households in the north of Gaza, and half of those displaced in the south, were enduring days without any food.
Noelia Monge, the head of emergencies for Action Against Hunger, said: “Everything we are doing is insufficient to meet the needs of 2 million people. It is difficult to find flour and rice, and people have to wait hours to access latrines and wash themselves. We are experiencing an emergency like I have never seen before.”
The UN’s hunger monitoring system, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), issued a report saying the “most likely scenario” in Gaza is that by 7 February “the entire population in the Gaza Strip [about 2.2 million people] would be at “crisis or worse” levels of hunger.
“This is the highest share of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity that the IPC initiative has ever classified for any given area or country,” the report said.
The IPC warned that by 7 February about 50% of the population are forecast to be in the “emergency” phase – defined as very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality.
The IPC has a five-stage system for assessing food crises and its report said that in Gaza “at least one in four households”, over half a million people, would be facing phase-five catastrophic conditions.
“Even though the levels of acute malnutrition and non-trauma related mortality might not have yet crossed famine thresholds, these are typically the outcomes of prolonged and extreme food consumption gaps,” it said.
Starvation is compounding the threats of disease and exposure as winter sets in at a time when about 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced by the Israeli military offensive, triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas.
Hamas issued a statement on Thursday saying there “should be no talk about prisoners or exchange deals except after a full cessation of aggression”. It said the declaration represented a “Palestinian national decision”.
About 120 Israelis are still being held by Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. More than 100 were released in an earlier deal under which hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were also freed and there was a temporary halt in fighting.
Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader based in Qatar, travelled to Cairo this week for discussions with Egyptian officials seeking to broker another agreement. The meeting ended without results.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, appeared to dismiss the prospect of another truce on Wednesday. “Whoever thinks that we will stop is detached from reality. We will not stop the fighting until all of the goals that we have set are achieved: the elimination of Hamas, the release of our hostages and the removal of the threat from Gaza,” he said in a statement.
Egypt’s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, said he was astonished that the UN security council, after a month of negotiations, had been unable to back a resolution calling for a humanitarian cessation of hostilities in Gaza. “We need to call things by their real name. We have a crisis,” he said.
The World Health Organization said there were no functional hospitals left in the north of Gaza and only nine partly functional in the south.
Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative in Gaza, said: “There are actually no functional hospitals left in the north. Al-Ahli was the last one but it is now minimally functional, still treating patients but not admitting new ones.”
He said al-Ahli was a “shell of a hospital”, resembling a hospice providing very limited care. About 10 staff, all junior doctors and nurses, were providing basic first aid, pain management and wound care with scant resources, he said.
“Until two days ago, it was the only hospital where injured people could get surgery in northern Gaza, and that was overwhelmed with patients needing emergency care,” he said. “There are no operating theatres any more due to the lack of fuel, power, medical supplies and health workers, including surgeons and other specialists.”
Peeperkorn said corpses were lined up in the hospital’s courtyard because they could not be given safe and dignified burials.
Some patients at al-Ahli had been waiting for surgery for weeks, and those who had been operated on were at risk of infection due to lack of antibiotics and other drugs. “All these patients cannot move and need to be transferred urgently to have a chance to survive,” he said.
A humanitarian ceasefire was needed to “reinforce and restock remaining health facilities, deliver medical services needed by thousands of injured people and those needing other essential care, and above all to stop the bloodshed and death”, Peeperkorn said.
Aside from al-Ahli hospital, three others in northern Gaza were barely functioning.
Israeli forces said on Thursday that they had uncovered a network of tunnels with entrances connected to the homes of Hamas leaders in Gaza City.
The IDF released images that appear to show spiral staircases leading to the tunnels, heavy blast doors, electricity infrastructure and plumbing.
The Hamas government’s media office said on Wednesday that at least 20,000 people had been killed in Gaza since 7 October, including 8,000 children and 6,200 women. About 1,200 people were killed in Israel during Hamas’s murderous rampage on 7 October.

UN security council vote delayed yet again and now set for Friday – as it happened,2023-12-22,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/dec/21/israel-gaza-war-live-updates-hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-hostage-talks-egypt-palestine,"This blog is now closed
The US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield has been speaking at the security council in New York.
In a transcript released by the US mission to the UN she says:
I just want to share with you that we have worked hard and diligently over the course of the past week with the Emiratis, with others, with Egypt, to come up with a resolution that we can support. And we do have that resolution now. We’re ready to vote on it. And it’s a resolution that will bring humanitarian assistance to those in need. It will support the priority that Egypt has in ensuring that we put a mechanism on the ground that will support humanitarian assistance, and we’re ready to move forward.
Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield goes on to say:
I won’t share how I will vote, but it will be a resolution – if the resolution is put forward as is – that we can support.
When asked about whether the draft resolution has been watered down the Ambassador says:
The draft resolution is not watered down. The draft resolution is a very strong resolution that is fully supported by the Arab group that provides them what they feel is needed to get humanitarian assistance on the ground.
But Reuters has reported that an actual vote at the UN security council has been delayed another day until Friday, sourcing that to diplomats.
The United States, key allies and Arab nations have been engaging in high-level diplomacy in hopes of avoiding another US veto of a UN resolution on desperately needed aid to Gaza.
The US had voiced concerns about the text’s references to a cessation of hostilities in the war as well as the key sticking point – the inspection of aid trucks entering into Gaza to ensure they are only carrying humanitarian goods.
It’s 0537am in Gaza and Tel Aviv and this blog is now closing. But first, here is a summary of the latest events:
US says it will support an amended UN resolution aimed at increasing aid into Gaza. The US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield has been speaking at the security council in New York and said “I just want to share with you that we have worked hard and diligently over the course of the past week with the Emiratis, with others, with Egypt, to come up with a resolution that we can support. And we do have that resolution now. We’re ready to vote on it. And it’s a resolution that will bring humanitarian assistance to those in need.”
The vote is now delayed until Friday, it’s understood. The Reuters news agency says the vote was delayed after Russia (also a veto power in the UN security council) and some other council members complained during closed-door talks about the amendments made to appease the US, according to diplomats.
The US had also been wary of a reference in the draft resolution to a cessation of hostilities, according to diplomats. The US and Israel oppose a ceasefire, believing it would only benefit Hamas. Washington instead supports pauses in fighting to protect civilians and free hostages taken by Hamas. The draft resolution now has blunted language to have the council call for “urgent steps to immediately allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and also for creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.”
In the The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) latest assessment of the situation. It says that “On 21 December, heavy Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea, continued across most of the Gaza Strip. Intense ground operations and fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups continued, in most areas of Gaza, with the exception of Rafah. The firing of rockets by Palestinian armed groups into Israel continued”
The World Food Programme says its latest food security analysis for Gaza, shows that the entire population of Gaza is in crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity.
The Queen of Jordan, Rania Al Abdullah has written an opinion piece in the Washington Post about the war. In it she says: This has become an unequivocal humanitarian nightmare. With each passing day, the threshold of what is acceptable falls to new lows, setting a terrifying precedent for this and other wars to come.
Israeli forces invaded the Palestinian Red Crescent Society’s ambulance center in Jabalia in northern Gaza on Thursday evening, according to the PRCS. The PRCS added that Israeli forces arrested the crews and paramedics and took them to an unknown location while children and women remain trapped inside the center.
US senator Bernie Sanders has called on the US to not provide “another $10bn to the rightwing extremist [Benjamin] Netanyahu government to continue their war against the Palestinian people.” In an address to the US senate, Sanders said: “The Netanyahu government is continuing its military approach which is both immoral and in violation of international law.”
Canada’s immigration minister has announced temporary visas for people in Gaza with Canadian relatives, the Associated Press reports. In an announcement on Thursday, the immigration minister, Marc Miller, said that despite the offer of temporary visas, Canada cannot guarantee safe passage out of Gaza.
Cyprus’s president, Nikos Christodoulides, said on Thursday that his government was awaiting a green light from Israel to send a prepared package of desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza. His comments follow two days of talks between Cypriot and Israeli officials fine-tuning an initiative first proposed by the island republic in November. Christodoulides said: “We are waiting for final approval from Israel. We are ready.”
Here are some images of a gathering that took place to counter a rally that was calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The protesters are in New York, where the UN security council had been negotiating its latest draft resolution on the Israel-Gaza war.
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has released its latest assessment of the situation in Gaza and Israel. Here’s what it has to say on the fighting:
On 21 December, heavy Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea, continued across most of the Gaza Strip. Intense ground operations and fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups continued, in most areas of Gaza, with the exception of Rafah. The firing of rockets by Palestinian armed groups into Israel continued.
This is what the update had to say on the number of deaths inside Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Gaza ministry of health:
Between 7 October and 19 December, 19,667 fatalities were reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH), which has not published updated tolls since then. The Gaza Government Media Office reported on the fatalities as of 21 December, although their methodology is unknown. Taken together, with the noted caveats, these figures amount to about 20,000. Of them, more than 8,000 are said to be children and more than 6,200 women.
UN undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, has commented on a report on Gaza and the humanitarian situation there.
The report was released by The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. Here’s what Martin Griffiths had to say on X:
This announcement about the risk of famine in Gaza is sobering but not surprising. We have been warning for weeks that, with such deprivation and destruction, each day that goes by will only bring more hunger, disease and despair to the people of Gaza. The war must end. https://t.co/YqIeqoAR08
Let’s take a closer look at what we know of the UN draft text.
A key sticking point for the US had been a proposal for UN secretary-general António Guterres to establish a monitoring mechanism in Gaza “to exclusively monitor all humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza provided through land, sea and air routes” from countries not party to the war, Reuters reports.
Instead the amended draft resolution asks Guterres to appoint a senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator to establish a UN mechanism for accelerating aid to Gaza through states that are not party to the conflict, according to Reuters.
The initial draft resolution had demanded that Israel and Hamas allow and facilitate “the use of all land, sea and air routes to and throughout the entire Gaza“ for aid deliveries. That was changed to “all available routes,” which some diplomats said allows Israel to retain control over access.
The US had also been wary of a reference in the draft resolution to a cessation of hostilities, according to diplomats.
The US and Israel oppose a ceasefire, believing it would only benefit Hamas. Washington instead supports pauses in fighting to protect civilians and free hostages taken by Hamas. The draft resolution now has blunted language to have the council call for “urgent steps to immediately allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and also for creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.”
US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield has told reporters that it is “a resolution that we can support”, but she declined to specify if that meant the US would vote in favour or abstain, which would allow the resolution to be adopted.
Here’s more on why the vote might have been delayed until Friday.
The Reuters news agency says the vote was delayed after Russia (also a veto power in the UN security council) and some other council members complained during closed-door talks about the amendments made to appease the US, according to diplomats.
But Reuters says Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia declined to speak to reporters after the meeting.
Let’s get some more detail on what we know about the wording of the current draft resolution from the UN security council.
The United Arab Emirates is sponsoring the resolution on the conflict which has been amended in several key areas to secure compromise, according to the draft version seen by Agence France-Presse.
It demands all sides “allow and facilitate the use of all … routes to and throughout the entire Gaza Strip, including border crossings … for the provision of humanitarian assistance.”
The US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield has told reporters that “if the resolution is put forward as is, then we can support it.”
She denied that the draft resolution had been watered down.
“The draft resolution is a very strong resolution that is fully supported by the Arab group,” she said.
Diplomatic wrangling at the United Nations headquarters in Manhattan has caused the vote to be postponed several times this week, all of which has taken place against the backdrop of deteriorating conditions in Gaza and a mounting death toll.
Here’s some more on the latest coming out of the UN – including when the vote will actually happen.
Diplomatic sources are telling Agence France-Press that the UN security council has once again pushed back a vote for a much-delayed resolution on the Israel-Gaza war.
The postponement to Friday has come even as the United States, which has opposed a number of proposals during the resolution’s drafting, said it was ready to support it in its current form.
After days of delays, the latest draft version seen by AFP calls for “urgent steps to immediately allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and also for creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.”
It does not call for an immediate end to fighting, according to AFP.
The US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield has been speaking at the security council in New York.
In a transcript released by the US mission to the UN she says:
I just want to share with you that we have worked hard and diligently over the course of the past week with the Emiratis, with others, with Egypt, to come up with a resolution that we can support. And we do have that resolution now. We’re ready to vote on it. And it’s a resolution that will bring humanitarian assistance to those in need.

The US envoy to the United Nations, ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield has been speaking in New York, and says that the US can support a current draft Security Council resolution on Gaza Aid, according to Reuters.
A short time before that, Reuters reported that the UN security council vote on a bid to boost Gaza action had been delayed another day until Friday, sourcing that to diplomats.
Earlier we were hearing from Associated Press that agreement on a UN resolution on critical aid for Gaza was is ‘very close’ and a vote could be expected.
Shahad Matar, spokesperson for the United Arab Emirates which sponsored the Security Council resolution, told reporters late Thursday that “we’re very close to agreement.” She said the 15 council members would hold closed consultations to see changes to the draft resolution, and a vote would then take place.

The World Food Programme says its latest food security analysis for Gaza, shows that the entire population of Gaza is in crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity.
The report further highlighted that 26 percent of Gazans have exhausted their food supplies and coping capacities and face catastrophic hunger and starvation. The WFP’s Executive Director Cindy McCain says:
WFP has warned of this coming catastrophe for weeks. Tragically, without the safe, consistent access we have been calling for, the situation is desperate, and no one in Gaza is safe from starvation.
The Israeli military campaign in Gaza, experts say, now sits among the deadliest and most destructive in history, according to Associated Press. The agency reports:
In just over two months, the offensive has wreaked more destruction than the razing of Syria’s Aleppo between 2012 and 2016, Ukraine’s Mariupol or, proportionally, the Allied bombing of Germany in World War II. It has killed more civilians than the US-led coalition did in its three-year campaign against the Islamic State group.
The Israeli military has said little about what kinds of bombs and artillery it is using in Gaza. But from blast fragments found on-site and analyses of strike footage, experts are confident that the vast majority of bombs dropped on the besieged enclave are U.S.-made. They say the weapons include 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) “bunker-busters” that have killed hundreds in densely populated areas.
The Associated Press goes on to say that the Israeli military says every strike is cleared by legal advisers to make sure it complies with international law:
“We choose the right munition for each target – so it doesn’t cause unnecessary damage,” said the army’s chief spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari.
“Hamas is very entrenched within the civilian population,” Efraim Inbar, head of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, a thinktank, told Associated Press about why the level of destruction is so high. He also said intense bombardment of Hamas’ tunnels is needed to protect advancing Israeli ground forces from attacks.
The Queen of Jordan, Rania Al Abdullah has written an opinion piece in the Washington Post about the war. In it she says:
This has become an unequivocal humanitarian nightmare. With each passing day, the threshold of what is acceptable falls to new lows, setting a terrifying precedent for this and other wars to come.
No matter what side you support, you can still demand a cease-fire, the release of hostages and detainees, and unrestricted access to aid.
The Queen of Jordan goes on to say:
A cease-fire is just the beginning. We must also embark on the difficult process of rehumanization — recognizing the humanity of others and acting on that universal kinship.
Agreement on a UN resolution on critical aid for Gaza is ‘very close’ and a vote could be expected, Associated Press is reporting.
Shahad Matar, spokesperson for the United Arab Emirates which sponsored the Security Council resolution, told reporters late Thursday that “we’re very close to agreement.” She said the 15 council members would hold closed consultations to see changes to the draft resolution, and a vote would then take place.
The United States, key allies and Arab nations have been engaging in high-level diplomacy in hopes of avoiding another US veto of a UN resolution on desperately needed aid to Gaza.
Whether the changes are enough to meet US concerns about the text’s references to a cessation of hostilities in the war as well as the key sticking point – the inspection of aid trucks entering into Gaza to ensure they are only carrying humanitarian goods – remained to be seen.
The current draft calls for the UN to take over the job from Israel, which the United States and Israel, its close ally, oppose, Associated Press reports.

It’s 1:25am in Gaza and Tel Aviv and here is a short summary of where things stand:
Israeli forces invaded the Palestinian Red Crescent Society’s ambulance center in Jabalia in northern Gaza on Thursday evening, according to the PRCS. The PRCS added that Israeli forces arrested the crews and paramedics and took them to an unknown location while children and women remain trapped inside the center.
US senator Bernie Sanders has called on the US to not provide “another $10bn to the rightwing extremist [Benjamin] Netanyahu government to continue their war against the Palestinian people.” In an address to the US senate, Sanders said: “The Netanyahu government is continuing its military approach which is both immoral and in violation of international law.”
The UN security council resolution on Gaza’s aid delivery remains stalled, Agence France-Presse reports. The draft resolution, which is sponsored by the UAE, has already been watered down to secure compromise, according to AFP, which reviewed the draft version. However, the US’s deputy ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said on Thursday that the US was still not satisfied with the latest draft.
Canada’s immigration minister has announced temporary visas for people in Gaza with Canadian relatives, the Associated Press reports. In an announcement on Thursday, the immigration minister, Marc Miller, said that despite the offer of temporary visas, Canada cannot guarantee safe passage out of Gaza.

US senator Bernie Sanders has called on the US to not provide “another $10bn to the rightwing extremist [Benjamin] Netanyahu government to continue their war against the Palestinian people”.
In an address to the US senate, Sanders said:
The Netanyahu government is continuing its military approach which is both immoral and in violation of international law …
The United States must end our complicity in those actions and to do so, we must make two critical changes in our policy.
First, while it is appropriate to support defensive systems like Iron Dome to protect Israeli civilians against incoming rockets, it would be irresponsible to provide an additional $10.1bn in military aid beyond those defensive systems as contained in the proposed supplemental foreign aid package …
Second … the United States should support efforts at the UN security council to end the bloodshed.
The situation in Gaza is a humanitarian disaster. The U.S. must not provide another $10 billion to the right-wing extremist Netanyahu government to continue their war against the Palestinian people which has already killed thousands of innocent men, women, and children. pic.twitter.com/Px2YEz7hEC

By banning Khawaja’s protest the ICC has boosted his message and revealed its own hypocrisy | Geoff Lemon,2023-12-26,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/27/by-banning-khawajas-protest-the-icc-has-boosted-his-message-and-revealed-its-own-hypocrisy,"The International Cricket Council doesn’t appear to mind personal beliefs, just not when they are applied too specifically and become political
Really, the International Cricket Council could not have done Usman Khawaja more of a favour. Had Australia’s opener been allowed to take the field for the Perth Test wearing shoes with two blandly general phrases about human rights written in pen on the sidewall, a few photos would have been published and that would have been that.
Instead, they banned the move, as well as his subsequent request to adorn his bat with the peace symbol of a dove holding an olive branch. Which has meant that the story has stayed in the news ever since among millions of views for Khawaja’s social media posts on the matter. His aim to publicly protest the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Indeed, you can ask why he needs to wear a symbol now, when events off the field have generated more attention. But it was always about the principle of using the stage that his ability affords, publicly normalising a gesture of support. Khawaja understands that doing nothing is as much a decision as doing something. Silence and speaking are choices. Passivity is an action. One individual speaking rarely creates change, but in time the collective swell of speech can. The entwined history of Palestine, Israel and Gaza is horrendously gnarled, but that only makes the principle of peace more urgent.
Khawaja wants the right to advance that principle in his place as a cricketer. His dove is a podium contender for innocuous iconography. Marnus Labuschagne has long worn a religious eagle sticker on his bat, which for the ICC is fine because it represents personal belief. They might want to note that Christian morality does include the primacy of human life and of mercy. Apparently that’s fine in the abstract – but in applying such beliefs too specifically, say to the idea that cities should not be bombed for months by military ordnance, beliefs become political.
Cricketers wear black armbands or hold moments of silence for victims of tragedy. They play fundraiser games after natural disasters. But deliberate human violence ordered and enacted by states? That’s politics, made manifest. Humans made those decisions, carried them out, had a rationale. For the ICC, which is essentially an escrow company made to funnel funds between boards and broadcasters, the easiest thing is to ignore it all.
In this aversion lies the particular contradiction – it seems trivial to call it irony, but what is hypocrisy if not irony in action – of an inherently politicised organiser of an inherently politicised sport. National teams playing national teams is political by definition. The ICC as a collection of members is run by the disproportionate might of India’s board, which commands the votes of smaller boards. The Indian board is now an unofficial arm of the national government, stacked with Bharatiya Janata party affiliates and hosting the recent World Cup final in a stadium named after the sitting prime minister.
India and Pakistan won’t tour one another due to political acrimony. Sri Lanka Cricket has as often been run from parliament as the committee rooms. South Africa’s sports minister recently sacked its corrupt cricket board. Bangladesh captain Shakib al-Hasan is running for a parliamentary seat. The ICC’s main sponsor is Aramco, the royal family oil company that drives Saudi Arabia’s economic might and shields it from the consequences of its depredations.

Afghanistan’s women’s cricket team dream of being unaffected by politics, having fled the country where women’s sport and education are banned. Meanwhile, the Taliban-backed board just announced it will freeze some of its top men’s players out of all foreign T20 leagues, denying them an income as punishment for wanting flexibility in representing the national team on far lower pay. Zimbabwe cricket bore the despotic fingerprints of Robert Mugabe’s henchmen for years, while Henry Olonga and Andy Flower are still praised for their black-armband protest against Mugabe at the 2003 World Cup. The current ICC would rule that protest illegal.
Eventually it all traces back to international cricket’s proudest legacy – the concerted blockade of apartheid South Africa through the 1970s and 1980s that helped fix that regime’s status as a pariah until change arrived. If the situation recurred today, one has far less confidence that cricket would take as thorough an approach.
The BCCI might argue that there was no value in denying a potential revenue stream and losing a quality member. The ICC chief executive, Geoff Allardice, might say, as he did on Afghanistan, that “as a cricket board, they’re functioning under the laws of their country,” and it isn’t his place to influence spending of the millions handed out each year. And if Khawaja decided to express his opposition with a quiet, symbolic act of protest, he would be told: “Sorry champ. None of that allowed. Get out there and bat.”

UN names Netherlands’ Sigrid Kaag aid coordinator for Gaza – as it happened,2023-12-27,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/dec/26/israel-gaza-war-live-updates-hamas-palestinians-deaths-idf-strikes-un,"This blog is now closed. See all our Israel-Gaza war coverage here
It’s 2.15am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv and we’ll close this blog shortly. Our live coverage will resume later today. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
The Israeli military said it had expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to refugee camps in the central part of the Palestinian territory. Israeli forces continued to bombard the densely populated Nuseirat, Maghazi and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza for a fourth day on Tuesday. The World Health Organisation emergency medical teams coordinator, Sean Casey, said “100-plus patients” had been brought into al-Aqsa hospital in the space of 30 minutes on Monday, adding that “about 100” more lifeless bodies were brought into the hospital around the same time.
Israel is engaged in a “multi-front war”, its defence minister Yoav Gallant, has said, hinting at military operations across the Middle East as the war in Gaza showed new signs of a dangerous regional escalation. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Gallant said Israel was “coming under attack from seven theatres: Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria [an Israeli term for the West Bank], Iraq, Yemen and Iran”.
Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza will probably go on for many months, the country’s military chief has said. Herzi Halevi, the Israel Defence Forces’ chief of staff, said on Tuesday that its forces would reach the Hamas leadership “whether it takes a week or whether it takes months”.
Nearly 21,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday. The latest figures say 20,915 people have been killed and 54,918 injured, including 241 Palestinians who were killed in the past 24 hours and 382 injured.
Israeli forces killed two Palestinian people in a raid on a refugee camp near the occupied West Bank city of Hebron on Tuesday, the Palestinian health ministry has said. The two people – aged 17 and 31 – were shot dead in the Fawwar refugee camp, south of Hebron, the ministry said.
All telecommunications and Internet services have been lost in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian phone service provider, Paltel, said on Tuesday. In a social media post, it said its services had experienced a “complete breakdown” that was “due to the ongoing offensive”.
The United Nations is “gravely concerned” about the “continued bombardment” of central Gaza by Israeli forces, a UN human rights office spokesperson has said. In a statement, Seif Magango urged Israeli forces to take all measures available to protect civilians and that attacks must adhere to the principles of humanitarian international law.
The Israel Defence Forces said nine of its soldiers were wounded in an anti-tank missile fired by Lebanon’s Hezbollah group on Tuesday. The IDF soldiers were evacuating a civilian who had been injured in an earlier Hezbollah attack on a church, the army said. One of the soldiers was in a “serious condition”, it said. Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari accused Hezbollah of “committing war crimes by indiscriminately attacking places of worship”.
Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch former deputy prime minister and a Middle East expert, has been appointed the United Nations’ coordinator for humanitarian aid to Gaza. The announcement by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, follows last week’s security council resolution calling for aid to be delivered to the territory “at scale”. The US welcomed Kaag’s appointment. She is expected to start on 8 January.
Yemen’s Houthi rebel group has said it carried out drone attacks targeting the Israeli port city of Eilat, as well as a commercial vessel in the Red Sea. A Houthi military spokesperson said the group launched an attack with missiles on a MSC United commercial ship in the Red Sea after it rejected three warning calls, as well as drone attacks on the southern Israeli city of Eilat “and other areas in occupied Palestine”.
US Central Command said the US had downed 12 drones, three anti-ship ballistic missiles and two land attack cruise missiles fired by Houthis in the southern Red Sea.
The Israeli army has said it arrested senior Palestinian politician Khalida Jarrar in the occupied West Bank, along with other activists of her party. Jarrar, a prominent figure in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), had been previously arrested by Israeli forces in October 2019 and released in September the following year, after being held without trial.
A blast occurred near the Israeli embassy in New Delhi on Tuesday, authorities said. No staff members were wounded or killed in the incident, authorities said, adding that investigations into its cause were ongoing. Israel urged its citizens in India, specifically in New Delhi, to exercise caution.
Israel will no longer grant automatic visas to UN employees, after accusing the global body of being “complicit partners” in Hamas’s tactics. The move comes after Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, said on Monday that he had instructed his ministry not to renew the visa of a UN staff member in Israel.
The United States has welcomed the appointment Sigrid Kaag of the Netherlands as the UN coordinator for humanitarian aid to Gaza.
State department spokesman Matthew Miller said on X (formerly Twitter) that the US looked forward to working closely with Kaag “to accelerate and streamline provision of live-saving humanitarian relief” to Palestinian civilians in the territory.
We welcome today’s @UN appointment of Sigrid Kaag as Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza. We look forward to working closely with her and @UNOPS to accelerate and streamline provision of live-saving humanitarian relief to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch former deputy prime minister and a Middle East east expert, has been appointed the United Nations’ coordinator for humanitarian aid to Gaza.
The announcement by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Tuesday follows the security council’s adoption of a resolution on Friday requesting him to expeditiously appoint a senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, where more than 2 million civilians are in desperate need of food, water and medicine, the Associated Press reports.
Guterres said Kaag, who speaks fluent Arabic and five other languages, “brings a wealth of experience in political, humanitarian and development affairs as well as in diplomacy” to her new post. She is expected to start on 8 January.
“She will facilitate, coordinate, monitor, and verify humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza,” he said, adding that Kaag will also establish a UN mechanism to accelerate aid deliveries “through states which are not party to the conflict”.
Gaza’s entire population of 2.3 million population is in food crisis, with 576,000 people at catastrophic or starvation levels and the risk of famine “increasing each day”, according to a report released last Thursday by 23 UN and nongovernmental organisations. It blamed the widespread hunger on insufficient aid entering Gaza.
Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, medicine and fuel into the territory after the militant Hamas group’s 7 October rampage in southern Israel which killed about 1,200 people. The Israel-Gaza war has so far killed more than 20,900 people in Gaza, according to its Hamas-run health ministry.
After US pressure, Israel allowed a trickle of aid in through Egypt, but UN agencies say that for weeks only 10% of food needs has been entering Gaza. Last week, Israel opened the Kerem Shalom crossing into the territory and truck traffic increased but an Israeli strike on Thursday morning on the Palestinian side of the crossing stopped aid pickups, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said.

Here is the latest full report on the Israel-Gaza war from the Guardian’s Bethan McKernan in Jerusalem:
Israel is engaged in a “multi-front war”, its defence minister has said, hinting at military operations across the Middle East as the war in Gaza showed new signs of a dangerous regional escalation.
Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Yoav Gallant said Israel was “coming under attack from seven theatres: Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria [an Israeli term for the West Bank], Iraq, Yemen and Iran”.
“We have already responded and taken action in six of these theatres,” he told the Knesset, without specifying.
Iran-allied militias around the Middle East have attacked Israel and US military installations across the region since Hamas launched its devastating attack on southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,140 people and taking up to 250 hostage.
The US has downed 12 drones, three anti-ship ballistic missiles and two land attack cruise missiles fired by the Houthis in the Southern Red Sea, according to US Central Command on X.
U.S. assets, to include the USS LABOON (DDG 58) and F/A-18 Super Hornets from the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group, shot down twelve one-way attack drones, three anti-ship ballistic missiles, and two land attack cruise missiles in the Southern Red Sea that were fired by the… pic.twitter.com/vRQ5e6Au6d
The post came after the Yemeni rebel group said it carried out drone attacks targeting the Israeli port city of Eilat, as well as a commercial vessel in the Red Sea earlier in the day.
It’s just past midnight in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
The Israeli military said it has expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to refugee camps in the central part of the Palestinian territory. Israeli forces continued to bombard the densely populated Nuseirat, Maghazi and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza for a fourth day on Tuesday. WHO emergency medical teams coordinator, Sean Casey, said “100-plus patients” had been brought into Al-Aqsa hospital in the space of 30 minutes on Monday, adding that “about 100” more lifeless bodies were brought into the hospital at around the same time.
Israel is engaged in a “multi-front war”, its defence minister Yoav Gallant has said, hinting at military operations across the Middle East as the war in Gaza showed new signs of a dangerous regional escalation. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Gallant said Israel was “coming under attack from seven theatres: Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria [an Israeli term for the West Bank], Iraq, Yemen and Iran”.
Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza will probably go on for many months, the country’s military chief has said. Herzi Halevi, the chief of staff of the IDF, told a press conference on Tuesday that its forces will reach the Hamas leadership “whether it takes a week or whether it takes months”.
Nearly 21,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday. The latest figures state that 20,915 people have been killed and 54,918 injured, including 241 Palestinians who were killed in the past 24 hours and 382 were injured.
Israeli forces killed two Palestinian people on Tuesday in a raid on a refugee camp near the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, the Palestinian health ministry has said. The two people – aged 17 and 31 – were shot dead in the Fawwar refugee camp, south of Hebron, the ministry said.
All telecommunications and Internet services have been lost in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian phone service provider, Paltel, said on Tuesday. In a social media post, it said its services had experienced a “complete breakdown” that was “due to the ongoing offensive”.
The UN is “gravely concerned” about the “continued bombardment” of central Gaza by Israeli forces, a UN human rights office spokesperson has said. In a statement, Seif Magango urged Israeli forces to take all measures available to protect civilians and that attacks must adhere to the principles of humanitarian international law.
Israel Defense Forces said nine of its soldiers were wounded in an anti-tank missile fired by Lebanon’s Hezbollah group on Tuesday. The IDF soldiers were evacuating a civilian who had been injured in an earlier Hezbollah attack on a church, the army said. One of the soldiers was in a “serious condition”, it said. Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari accused Hezbollah of “committing war crimes by indiscriminately attacking places of worship”.
Yemen’s Houthi rebel group has said that it carried out drone attacks targeting the Israeli port city of Eilat, as well as a commercial vessel in the Red Sea. A Houthi military spokesperson said the group launched an attack with missiles on a MSC United commercial ship in the Red Sea after it rejected three warning calls, as well as drone attacks on the southern Israeli city of Eilat “and other areas in occupied Palestine”.
The Israeli army has said it arrested senior Palestinian politician Khalida Jarrar in the occupied West Bank, along with other activists of her party. Jarrar, a prominent figure in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), had been previously arrested by Israeli forces in October 2019 and released in September the following year, after being held without trial.
A blast occurred near the Israeli embassy in New Delhi on Tuesday, authorities said. No staff members were wounded or killed during the incident, authorities said, adding that investigations into its cause were ongoing. Israel urged its citizens in India, specifically in New Delhi, to exercise caution.
Israel will no longer grant automatic visas to United Nations employees, after accusing the global body of being “complicit partners” in Hamas’s tactics. The move comes after Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, on Monday said he had instructed his ministry not to renew the visa of a UN staff member in Israel.
France is “gravely concerned” by Israel’s announcement that it will intensify and prolong fighting against Hamas in Gaza, the French foreign ministry has said.
A statement from the ministry said France “strongly reiterates its call for an immediate truce leading to a ceasefire”, while condemning the “systematic bombing that has again left many civilian victims in recent days”.
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said nine of its soldiers were wounded in an anti-tank missile fired by Lebanon’s Hezbollah group on Tuesday.
The IDF soldiers were evacuating a civilian who had been injured in an earlier Hezbollah attack on a church, the army said. One of the soldiers was in a “serious condition”, it said.
The Israeli army said that in the earlier attack, the missile had hit a Greek Orthodox church in Iqrit, referring to an abandoned Palestinian Christian village whose inhabitants were forced to leave during the 1948 war and creation of Israel, AFP reported.
Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari accused Hezbollah of “committing war crimes by indiscriminately attacking places of worship”.
Here are some of the latest images from the newswires of a school in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza that has suffered massive damage from Israeli attacks.
The Emir of Qatar, sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, held a phone call with the US president, Joe Biden, on Tuesday to discuss the latest developments in Gaza, according to Qatari state media.
The pair also spoke about current joint mediation efforts for calming the situation in Gaza to reach a permanent ceasefire, according to a report from the Qatari state news agency.
The Israeli military said it has expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to the densely populated urban refugee camps in the central part of the Palestinian territory.
As we reported earlier, people in central Gaza described a night of shelling and airstrikes shaking the Nuseirat, Maghazi and Bureij refugee camps on Tuesday. The camps are crowded with Palestinians whose families fled during the 1948 war as well as with civilians who recently fled northern Gaza in the early stages of Israel’s ground offensive.
“We have expanded the fighting to an area known as the central camps,” Israel’s military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, told a news conference today, Associated Press reported. He added:
We will continue to adapt the operation, the method and the composition of the forces according to the operational need.
Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has said he will not extend the term of the country’s Prison Service commissioner, Katy Perry.
In a statement from his ministry, Ben-Gvir said he did not have enough faith in Perry to allow her to continue in her current position, the Jerusalem Post reported.
The Israeli minister also accused Perry of having conducted negotiations with imprisoned Hamas militants on the terms of their incarceration, the Times of Israel reported.
In response, a statement from Perry said:
An unsurprising decision by an irresponsible minister that combines unfounded and baseless claims, a detachment from reality and childishness that show his lack of understanding of the prisons service.
Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz’s National Unity party also responded to the announcement, warning that replacing senior officials “at this time harms the functioning of the country during a time of war and is not right”.
Here’s a small update after we reported earlier that an explosion occurred near the Israeli embassy in New Delhi.
No staff members were wounded or killed during the incident, according to authorities, who added that investigations into its cause were ongoing.
Officials were still inspecting the area but it has since been reopened to the general public, Reuters reported. There was no information suggesting anyone on the street had been hurt, it said.
Israel urged its citizens in India, specifically in New Delhi, to exercise caution. The blast “may have been an attack”, Israel’s national security council said in a statement issued by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.
“We can confirm that around 5:20 pm there was a blast at close proximity to the embassy,” an Israeli embassy spokesperson told Reuters, adding that local police and security teams were investigating.
Nothing had been found in the search operation three hours after the blast, an official involved in the investigation told the news agency.

Israel widens offensive in central Gaza as Netanyahu refuses to discuss postwar plan,2023-12-27,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/27/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-refuses-to-discuss-postwar-plan-for-gaza-strip,"Security officials keen to arrange meeting as ‘time running out’, according to reports
The Israeli military expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to the densely populated urban refugee camps in the central part of the territory as the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was reported to have refused requests from security officials to make plans for control of Gaza after the war with Hamas ends.
Over the last few days, three requests to the prime minister’s office were conveyed on behalf of the directors of the Mossad, the Shin Bet, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff and the defence ministry to arrange a meeting on decisions relating to “the day after” Israel declares it has achieved its goals against the Palestinian militant group in control of the Gaza Strip, Israel’s Channel 12 reported on Tuesday night.
All those requests were refused, the network said. “Time is running out and decisions need to be made already about how to act with regard to all the relevant actors inside and outside the Gaza Strip. The Americans want explanations,” it quoted an unnamed security official as saying.
Tuesday’s report comes amid allegations in the Israeli media that Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, have also refused to discuss the long-expected transition from the current “high intensity” stage of fighting to a new phrase focused on the more precise targeting of Hamas’s leaders, as well as a report that Netanyahu did not allow Gallant to hold detailed discussions with the Mossad about a possible hostage release deal.
Netanyahu may wish to postpone such discussions to protect his position as prime minister: his wartime unity government will disband after the conflict ends, and any solution for Gaza that involves Palestinian actors, such as the return of the West Bank’s Palestinian Authority, threatens the stability of his far-right coalition government.
A spokesperson for the prime minister’s office said a date for a cabinet discussion on “the day after” had been set a month ago and would take place in the coming days.
In his first interview since the hostilities broke out, the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, said on Tuesday night that the war was “beyond a catastrophe”, accusing Netanyahu of planning “to get rid of the Palestinians”.
On the ground in Gaza, Israel has broadened its offensive against Hamas, expanding into several overcrowded refugee camps near the central town of Deir al-Balah, as well as launching heavy airstrikes on the southern towns of Khan Younis and Rafah – all areas the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.
On Wednesday, thousands of Palestinian families who fled Bureij camp, heavily targeted overnight, set up tents in the streets of Deir al-Balah.
“It was a night of hell. We haven’t seen such bombing since the start of the war,” said Rami Abu Mosab, speaking from Bureij, where he has been sheltering since fleeing his home in northern Gaza.
He said warplanes flew overhead, and gunfire and explosions echoed from the eastern edge of the camp. A home near his shelter was hit, but no one was able to reach the area, he said. The health authority in the Hamas-run strip said that more than 200 people had been killed in the last 24 hours.
House-to-house fighting has also been reported in the north of Gaza, despite comments from the IDF chief of staff over the weekend that the military had largely achieved operational control above the Gaza River.
Since Christmas Eve, the besieged Palestinian territory has suffered some of the deadliest days of the 12-week-old conflict to date, sparked by Hamas’s devastating attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which militants killed 1,140 people and took up to 250 hostage.
Israel’s retaliatory war on the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip has already become one of the most destructive conflicts of the 21st century, with estimates suggesting more than 20,900 people have been killed, 55,000 injured, and 85% of the Palestinian territory’s 2.3 million people forced to flee their homes.
Despite rising international outcry over the humanitarian disaster, including growing criticism from the US, Israel’s most important ally, Netanyahu has said that Israel will push on until “complete victory” over Hamas.
Ron Dermer, a member of Israel’s war cabinet, is expected to meet with US officials in Washington on Wednesday. Divisions within the Biden administration over Israel policy have been growing, with some officials saying the US has underestimated the scale of disillusionment in the global south over perceived hypocrisy in calling out Russian war crimes in Ukraine, but finding a multitude of reasons to justify the large-scale killings of Palestinians in Gaza.
Also on Wednesday, the UN appointed Sigrid Kaag, the Netherlands’ outgoing finance minister, as aid coordinator to the Palestinian territory, following last week’s watered-down security council resolution, which called for aid to be delivered to Gaza “at scale”.
About 200 trucks a day are currently entering Gaza, but aid agencies say this is a fraction of what is needed. Before the latest conflict broke out, about 500 goods and aid trucks entered the territory every day.
The war in Gaza is also showing new signs of dangerous regional escalation, even as ceasefire talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar appear to have stalled.
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed at least six Palestinians during an overnight raid in the refugee neighbourhood of Nur Shams, according to the Palestinian health ministry, bringing the total number of casualties in the territory to 300.
Israel and the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah have traded near-daily volleys of missiles, airstrikes and shelling across the frontier since 7 October: an Israeli strike on a house overnight killed a Hezbollah fighter and two relatives, local officials and state media said.
Behind the scenes, the US is leading intense negotiations to try to de-escalate the hostilities on the Blue Line that separates the two countries, where the risk of miscalculation setting off a regional war drawing in Iran and its proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen is highest.

"‘Intense’ ground fighting blocking aid deliveries in Gaza, UN warns – as it happened",2023-12-27,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/dec/27/israel-gaza-war-live-hamas-palestinians-west-bank-un-aid-us,"This blog has now closed.

The UN humanitarian office (OCHA) has warned that the scale and intensity of ground operations and fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza is hindering the delivery of aid to those in need.
In a statement on Wednesday, the OCHA said “heavy” Israeli bombardment from air, land, and sea had continued across most of the Gaza Strip between 23 and 26 December.
It noted that Israeli forces reportedly carried out 50 strikes on three refugee camps – Al Bureij, An Nuseirat, and Al Maghazi – on 24-25 December. Dozens of people were killed in the strikes, according to Palestinian health officials. An unknown number of people are still believed to be trapped under the rubble.
The strikes also destroyed the roads connecting these camps, “hindering the delivery of relief aid”, the OCHA said. An OCHA spokesperson “expressed its grave concern about the continued bombardment of middle Gaza by Israeli forces”, the statement said. It added:
Humanitarian operations are facing increasing operational challenges due to intensified hostilities, insecurity, blocked roads, scarcity of fuel, and extremely limited communications.
It’s 1am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv and this blog is now closing. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
The UN humanitarian office (OCHA) has warned that the scale and intensity of ground operations and fighting in Gaza is hindering the delivery of aid to those in need. In a statement on Wednesday, the OCHA said humanitarian operations are “facing increasing operational challenges due to intensified hostilities, insecurity, blocked roads, scarcity of fuel, and extremely limited communications.”
Israel launched heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza overnight and into Wednesday after broadening its offensive against Hamas to more areas where the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war. Residents reported heavy bombing in the built-up Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, in the southern city of Khan Younis and in the southern town of Rafah, areas where tens of thousands have sought refuge as much of northern Gaza was pounded to rubble. An Israeli strike killed 20 Palestinians near al-Amal hospital in Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis, according to a Gaza health ministry spokesperson.
At least 21,110 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since 7 October, according to figures released on Wednesday by the health ministry in the territory. The ministry reported that 55,243 people had been wounded. It said 195 people were killed and 325 injured in the last 24 hours.
Six Palestinians were killed and several others wounded on Wednesday after an Israeli operation in a Palestinian refugee camp in the north of the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian ministry of health. According to the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, the six people were killed by Israeli airstrikes on the Nur Shams refugee camp near the town of Tulkarem, where Israeli soldiers were also deployed.
Israel’s military chief, Herzi Halevi, has said his forces are “at a very high level of readiness” amid escalating Hezbollah attacks from Lebanon. Israeli war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, separately said that the situation on the country’s northern border “demands change”, adding that the time for diplomacy “is running out”. Hezbollah claimed on Wednesday morning to have fired 18 rockets into Israel from Lebanon. The IDF said it intercepted some of the rockets. A Hezbollah fighter was killed late Tuesday in an Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon along with his brother, a Lebanese-Australian national, and his wife, according to reports.
Telecommunications and Internet services are being gradually restored in central and southern Gaza, the Palestinian phone service provider, Paltel, has said on Wednesday. Phone and Internet services experienced a “complete breakdown” on Tuesday that was “due to the ongoing offensive”, it said.
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the people of Gaza face “grave peril”. In a statement on Wednesday, the WHO said its teams had undertaken “high-risk” missions to deliver supplies to hospitals in northern and southern Gaza, where they witnessed “intense hostilities in their vicinity, high patient loads and overcrowding.”
Israel has responded furiously to comments by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, comparing Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler. Speaking at an awards ceremony in Ankara, Erdoğan said the Israeli prime minister was no different from Hitler and likened Israel’s attacks on Gaza to the treatment of Jewish people by the Nazis. Netanyahu responded by saying the Turkish president should be the last person to lecture Israel. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said Erdoğan’s remarks were “deeply offensive” to Jewish people around the world.
France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, told Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a call on Wednesday of the need to work towards a durable ceasefire, according to a statement from the French presidency. A readout of the call from the Israeli prime minister’s office said Netanyahu thanked Macron “for France’s involvement in defending freedom of navigation and its willingness to help restore security along Israel’s border with Lebanon.”
Benjamin Netanyahu has allegedly refused requests from security officials to begin making plans for control and governance of the Gaza Strip after the war ends, according to a report. Multiple requests were conveyed on behalf of the directors of the Mossad, the Shin Bet security agency, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) chief of staff and the defence ministry to arrange a meeting with the prime minister’s office, Israeli media reported. Meanwhile, a White House official has said national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and Israel’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, have discussed planning for the day after the Israel-Gaza war, including governance and security in Gaza.
More than two dozen pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested on Wednesday after blocking traffic heading to John F Kennedy International Airport in New York, according to police.
The Port Authority police department (PAPD) said 26 people were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and impeding vehicular traffic. It said buses were sent to offer rides for travellers affected by the backup.
Photos and videos on social media showed protesters holding hands and forming a line that stretched across the highway, holding banners that said “Free Palestine,” “Genocide then//Genocide now,” “Right to return” and “Divest from genocide.”
Similar protests took place at Los Angeles International Airport today, during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.
The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said about 36 protesters were arrested of rioting, and that at least one person was arrested “for battery on a police officer”.
This unlawful behavior is dangerous and will not be tolerated. Approx. 36 protesters were arrested and booked for 404.6 PC (Rioting) and at least one arrested for battery on a police officer.
The UN humanitarian office (OCHA) also warned that telecommunications blackouts across Gaza are affecting humanitarian deliveries in the Palestinian territory.
On Tuesday and overnight to Wednesday, the primary telecommunications provider in the Gaza Strip reported another halt to phone and Internet services, citing damage to its infrastructure.
In its statement, the OCHA said:
Humanitarian agencies and first responders have warned that blackouts jeopardise the already constrained provision of life-saving assistance in Gaza.
The UN humanitarian office (OCHA) has warned that the scale and intensity of ground operations and fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza is hindering the delivery of aid to those in need.

Mourners gathered for the funerals of six Palestinians who were killed by a drone strike during an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank town of Tulkarem, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
As we reported earlier, the operation took place in the early hours of Wednesday in the Nur Shams refugee camp in Tulkarem.
The Israeli military said its forces came under attack by militants who threw explosive devices at them during a counter-terrorism operation.
But witnesses said the six young men killed in the strike were sitting together but were not involved in the clashes with Israeli forces, Reuters reported.
The men were aged between 17 and 29, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, told Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a call on Wednesday of the need to work towards a durable ceasefire “with the help of all regional and international partners,” according to a statement from the French presidency.
France will also work with Jordan in the coming days on humanitarian operations in Gaza, the statement added.
According to a readout of the call from the Israeli prime minister’s office, Netanyahu thanked Macron “for France’s involvement in defending freedom of navigation and its willingness to help restore security along Israel’s border with Lebanon.”
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke this evening with French President Emmanuel Macron and thanked him for France's involvement in defending freedom of navigation and its willingness to help restore security along Israel's border with Lebanon.
The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is investigating reports that two Australian brothers have been killed in Lebanon, the Australian Associated Press writes.
Local media reported that Ali and Ibrahim Bazzi, and Ibrahim’s wife, Shorouq Hammoud, had died after an Israeli airstrike in the town of Bint Jbeil in southern Lebanon. Ali had been a Hezbollah fighter, the reports said, and images of his funeral showed a military-style farewell with the coffin draped in a Hezbollah flag.
In a brief statement on Wednesday the department said it was aware of reports of a death of an Australia citizen and was seeking confirmation.
Thousands of Palestinian families were fleeing from the brunt of Israel’s expanding ground offensive into Gaza’s few remaining, overcrowded refuges, as the military launched heavy strikes across the center and south of the territory, killing dozens, Palestinian health officials said, according to the Associated Press.
Here is more from AP:
On foot or riding donkey carts loaded with belongings, a stream of people flowed into Deir al-Balah — a town that normally has a population of around 75,000. It has been overwhelmed by several hundred thousand people driven from northern Gaza as the region was pounded to rubble.
Because UN shelters are packed many times over capacity, the new arrivals set up tents on sidewalks for the cold winter night. Most crowded onto streets around the town’s main hospital hoping it would be safer from Israeli strikes.
Still, no place is safe in Gaza. Israeli offensives are crowding most of the population into Deir al-Balah and Rafah at the territory’s southern edge as well as a tiny rural area by the southern coastline. Those areas continue to be hit by Israeli strikes that regularly crush homes full of people.
Israel has said its campaign in Gaza is likely to last for months, vowing to dismantle Hamas across the territory and prevent a repeat of its 7 October attack into southern Israel. Benny Gantz, a member of the country’s three-man War Cabinet, said the fighting ”will be expanded, according to need, to additional centers and additional fronts.”
It’s nearly 10.30pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
Israel launched heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza overnight and into Wednesday after broadening its offensive against Hamas to more areas where the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.

A Hezbollah fighter was killed late Tuesday in an Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon along with his brother, a Lebanese-Australian national, and his wife, according to reports. Asked about the incident, the Israeli military said one of its jets had struck a Hezbollah military site overnight in Lebanon.
Israel’s military chief, Herzi Halevi, has said his forces are “at a very high level of readiness” amid escalating Hezbollah attacks from Lebanon.

Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said Erdoğan’s remarks were “deeply offensive” to Jewish people around the world.
Benjamin Netanyahu has allegedly refused requests from security officials to begin making plans for control and governance of the Gaza Strip after the war ends, according to a report. Multiple requests were conveyed on behalf of the directors of the Mossad, the Shin Bet security agency, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) chief of staff and the defence ministry to arrange a meeting with the prime minister’s office, Israeli media reported.
The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and Israel’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, have discussed planning for the day after the Israel-Gaza war, including governance and security in Gaza, a White House official has said. During a meeting in Washington on Tuesday, the two also discussed efforts to bring home the remaining hostages and a transition to a different phase of the war to maximise focus on high-value Hamas targets, according to the official.
King Abdullah II of Jordan has met with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in Cairo. The pair stressed their “complete rejection of all attempts to liquidate the Palestinian issue” and called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the uninterrupted delivery of sufficient humanitarian aid to the territory, a statement from King Abdullah II said.
The White House has welcomed the appointment of Sigrid Kaag as the United Nations senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza. The announcement of Kaag’s appointment on Tuesday followed the UN security council’s adoption of a resolution last week to appoint a senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza.
Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz has said that the situation on the country’s northern border must change, adding that the time for diplomacy was running out.
“The situation on Israel’s northern border demands change,” Gantz told a press conference, Reuters reported.
The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out, if the world and the Lebanese government don’t act in order to prevent the firing on Israel’s northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it.
The residents of Sheikh Radwan, a district in the north of Gaza City, are no strangers to warfare.
Born and raised in the neighbourhood, Emad Jameel’s entire life has been defined by fighting. His childhood was dominated by the first and second intifada, or Palestinian uprisings, and since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007, leading Israel to impose a near-total air, land and sea blockade, sheikh Radwan has been repeatedly hit by airstrikes both during and outside wartime.
Through it all, however, Jameel, now 31, found solace in friends and family. But he never dreamed of a war like the one Gaza is suffering now, and he never imagined himself homeless, cast adrift from his community and ferrying his children from place to place across the besieged territory in search of ever-elusive safety.
“Why are we subjected to such torture? Is it because we live in a cursed place, or is it because the whole world enjoys watching our suffering?” the clothing shop assistant said by phone.
All I want is to return to my home, even if it is in ruins. I want to live in a tent there and not in unfamiliar places with strangers.

World Health Organization (WHO) staff also reported witnessing tens of thousands of people fleeing heavy strikes in the Khan Younis and Middle Area in Gaza.
The UN agency said it was “extremely concerned” that this fresh displacement of people will further strain health facilities in southern Gaza.
Dr Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the West Bank and Gaza, said:
This forced mass movement of people will also lead to more overcrowding, increased risk of infectious diseases, and make it even harder to deliver humanitarian aid.
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has reiterated calls for the international communities to “take urgent steps to alleviate the grave peril” facing the people of Gaza.
In a statement, the WHO said its teams had undertaken “high-risk” missions to deliver supplies to hospitals in northern and southern Gaza, including to al-Shifa hospital and al-Amal Palestine Red Crescent Society on Tuesday.
During their missions, WHO staff witnessed “intense hostilities in their vicinity, high patient loads and overcrowding caused by people displaced by the conflict seeking refuge”, it said.
It said WHO teams reported “finding it impossible to walk inside the hospital without stepping over patients” and displaced people.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said:
The safety of our staff and continuity of operations depends on more food arriving in all of Gaza, immediately. My own colleagues are also being directly and personally affected by the conflict, just like virtually everyone in Gaza. I continue to receive heartbreaking news of the loss of our Gaza staffers’ family members.
An Israeli man has been arrested on suspicion of having desecrated a Muslim cemetery in occupied East Jerusalem by hanging a donkey’s head, Israeli police have said.
In a statement, police said the 35-year-old was arrested after they were alerted that a man had “broken the law and disrupted public order by hanging the head of a donkey” at the cemetery in East Jerusalem’s Old City, AFP reported.
Police said the man was carrying an axe at the time of his arrest, and that another suspect who allegedly had helped was also in custody.
Footage circulating on social media showed the head of a donkey hanging from a fence of the cemetery, which is adjacent to the ancient Muslim Bab al-Rahma cemetery and near the Al-Aqsa mosque compound.
The Jerusalem Waqf Islamic affairs described the incident as “a serious desecration of one of the main historic Muslim cemeteries in Jerusalem.”

Israel says time running out to reach diplomatic solution in Lebanon,2023-12-28,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/28/israel-says-time-running-out-to-reach-diplomatic-solution-with-lebanon,"Officials’ warning echoes those of two ministers, as fighting with Hezbollah intensifies on boundary
Israeli officials have hinted that the “diplomatic hourglass” is running out to reach a negotiated solution to the escalating fighting on the boundary with Lebanon, even as the war in Gaza continues at a ferocious pace.
Security sources said the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fired the most rockets and weaponised drones on Wednesday that it had in any single day since the clashes across the border began.
Israel and the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah have traded near-daily volleys of missiles, airstrikes and shelling across the UN-controlled blue line separating the countries since 7 October, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing 1,140 people and taking up to 250 hostage. About 150 people in Lebanon have been killed, including 17 civilians, and 11 in Israel, including four civilians, with tens of thousands in both countries displaced from their homes.
A report from Israel’s Kan radio on Thursday, after a particularly intense rocket salvo hit the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, quoted a government source as saying that the parties were “approaching the point when the chance of reaching an agreement that might guarantee that Hezbollah was distanced from the border would be exhausted … The sand in the diplomatic hourglass in Lebanon is running out.”
Those remarks followed comments by the foreign minister, Eli Cohen, after a trip to the north on Wednesday. He said: “There are only two options – a political solution or military operation. What existed prior to 7 October won’t any more … We will grant a certain amount of time for a political solution. And if none is [reached], all options are on the table.”
Another minister, Benny Gantz, said that the “situation on Israel’s northern border demands change.
“The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out; if the world and the Lebanese government don’t act in order to prevent the firing on Israel’s northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will do it,” he said at a media conference.
Militias allied with Tehran around the Middle East have launched drones and missiles towards Israel, disrupted international shipping in the Red Sea and attacked US military assets in the region in the wake of 7 October. Israel’s retaliatory war on the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip has already become one of the most destructive conflicts of the 21st century, with estimates suggesting more than 21,000 people have been killed, 55,000 injured, and 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million people forced to flee their homes.
Israeli tanks advanced deeper into the central Gaza Strip on Thursday as part of its widening offensive against Hamas, despite international calls for a ceasefire. Five days of relentless bombing of several overcrowded refugee camps near the central town of Deir al-Balah – all areas the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war – have led thousands more families to flee into Deir al-Balah town, setting up tents wherever there is space.
Farther south, Israeli forces struck the area around a hospital in the heart of Khan Younis, the Gaza Strip’s main southern city. Palestinian health authorities said 20 people were killed in the Khan Younis attack, and 210 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours.
The US has deployed military reinforcements in the region to deter further attacks on Israel, including the presence of aircraft carriers. But the longer the war in Gaza lasts, the greater the risk of miscalculation and regional escalation, which the Biden administration fears could draw in Iran. Earlier this week, Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, described the country as already engaged in a “multi-front war”.
Washington and Paris are leading intense secret negotiations to de-escalate the hostilities on the blue line, which are believed to include the possibility of finally resolving disputed territory on the border and persuading Hezbollah to withdraw its forces north of the Litani river, about 35km away.
The move would be in accordance with a UN resolution from the last war in 2006. Hezbollah, however, draws much of its grassroots support from the southern towns and villages closest to Israel, which were occupied for the better part of two decades before Israel withdrew its forces in 2000, and it is unlikely to willingly concede its raison d’etre – resistance against Israel.
“It is unlikely that any side wants it now, but war in Lebanon can happen any day if one sides misreads an action of the other,” a senior European diplomat in the region said. “The biggest risk is that Netanyahu will intentionally start it to stay in power after the Gaza war goes down to a [less intense] level, knowing that he will be out of a job the day after,” they added, referring to the Israeli prime minister.
Since the bloody summer war in 2006 that left swathes of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, in ruins, both parties have been careful to avoid a return to full-scale conflict. Israel has not fought a two-front war since a surprise attack on Yom Kippur by Syria from the north and Egypt from the south 50 years ago.
Gallant and others in the war cabinet argued for a pre-emptive strike against the militant group in the immediate aftermath of the 7 October attack, a proposal that the US succeeded in quashing. But the conviction that a new war in Lebanon is inevitable appears to have taken hold among Israeli politicians, generals and a widening slice of the public: an opinion poll carried out in late November found that 52% of those surveyed favoured an immediate strike against Hezbollah, and only 35% were opposed to opening another front in the north.
“Nasrallah needs to understand that he is next in line,” Cohen said, referring to Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s secretary general. “If he doesn’t want this, he needs to force Hezbollah back to north of the Litani. All solutions are before us to bring our residents safely home.”
Despite growing divisions over the war’s conduct with the US, Israel’s most important ally, Israeli officials have said that Israel will push on until “complete victory” over Hamas. That goal, however, seems to be slipping further away, given the army’s inability to capture or kill Hamas’s leaders and in the face of fierce guerilla resistance in areas ostensibly under the army’s control. Israel’s military chief said this week that the war would last many more months, and ceasefire talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt appear to have stalled.
Maha Rafiq, a 46-year-old mother of five from the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, said that she and her family had stopped thinking about when the war would end and were focused on day-to-day survival.
“We sleep and wake up to the incessant sounds of shells and gunfire. Every day, my husband and I venture out to search for food, uncertain if we will see each other again. In the market, we struggle to find even the simplest things and they are double the normal price. I have four daughters who need sanitary pads, but we cannot find them,” she said.
“I don’t know where we will go if the ground invasion comes here. We focus on how to stay alive, searching for shelter and moving from place to place.”

Rachel Roddy’s New Year recipe for good-luck lentils with sausages,2023-12-28,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/28/good-luck-lentils-with-sausages-recipe-rachel-roddy-new-year,"See in the new year with a dish of lentils – a symbol of luck, wealth and happiness – and succulent pork or vegetarian sausages
Thinking about the future prosperity of my family and friends, I recently carried two packets of lentils from Rome to Dorset. A wholly unnecessary exercise considering how widely available they are in the UK, but I did it to make myself feel important, I suppose. And so that, on New Year’s Eve, around the stroke of midnight, I can call everyone into the kitchen to eat a spoonful or seven, to ensure thriving good fortune and happiness in 2024. At least that is the idea.
Along with barley, pea, chickpea, bitter vetch, emmer wheat, einkorn wheat and flax, lentils are one of the eight neolithic founder crops domesticated as early as 12,000 years ago in the fertile crescent – what is now southern Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Egypt, and parts of Turkey and Iran. Cultivation seems to have been particularly significant in ancient Egypt, where red lentils have been found in burial tombs. Seeds travel, of course, thanks to birds and people, and lentils made their way all over the place. Including Greece and Italy, where they became a staple in the local diets, both as a whole pulse and ground into a flour suitable for making hearth bread. This double function and their nutritious, “useful” nature made lentils, known as lentĭcŭla, a precious food. And of course they look precious, the magic of their round form resembling a coin.
Lentils as an augury can be traced back to many cultures, including ancient Rome, where the gift of a leather purse full of raw lentils was a way to wish wealth on someone – the hope being that the lentils would be transformed into pecunia, or money. Over the centuries, a purse became a pot, its steaming contents an omen of a safe and secure tomorrow. At some point, in the north of Italy, lentils also collided with insaccati – sausages – themselves representing abundant richness. Namely cotechino – a northern Italian boiling sausage made of pork, lard, pork rind and spices – and zampone, a pig’s trotter stuffed similarly. Both cotechino and zampone are almost jelly-like in their pink fattiness, and wonderfully tasty. Simple sausages are equally delicious here, as are vegetarian sausages for those who love them. The most important part though is the lentils – ideally a small brown variety that cooks to tenderness but keeps its form. As always, the best variety is the one available to you that you know and feel comfortable cooking.
If this is a meal rather than a midnight snack, mashed potato makes a wonderful companion to lentils and sausages, or alternatively rice, which is another augury of plenty. Follow with 12 grapes (one for every month of the year) and dried fruit, nuts and fresh pomegranate eaten with a toothpick – and BB King bringing in a brand-new year.
Prep 10 minCook 45 minServes 6
300g small brown lentils6 tbsp olive oil1 medium-sized onion, peeled and finely diced1 celery stick, finely diced8 sage leavesSalt and black pepper6 large or 12 small sausages (pork or vegetarian)300ml white wine
If you have time, soak the lentils in water for a few hours – don’t worry if you don’t have time: the lentils will just take a little longer to cook, and remember that cooking times vary massively due to lentil variety and age, so keep tasting.
In a large heavy-based saucepan or terracotta pot set over a medium-low heat, warm the olive oil, onion, celery and sage until the onion is soft. Add the lentils and a pinch of salt, and cover with water so it rises 2cm above the lentils.
Simmer until the lentils are just tender and the water mostly absorbed – a little broth is nice, so if at any point during cooking they seem a little dry, add more water.
While the lentils cook, either grill or pan-fry the sausages, browning them on all sides, and add the wine, simmering until they are cooked through – about 30 minutes – with just a little gravy.
Either put the lentils and sausages on a large serving plate or serve directly from pans.

South Africa launches case at UN court accusing Israel of genocide,2023-12-29,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/29/south-africa-accuses-israel-of-committing-genocide-in-gaza,"Nation asks international court of justice to issue provisional measures ordering ceasefire; Israel describes case as ‘blood libel’
South Africa has launched a case against Israel at the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) accusing the state of committing genocide in its military campaign in Gaza.
Israel responded to the allegations “with disgust”, calling South Africa’s case a “blood libel” and urging the ICJ to reject it.
Any case at the ICJ is likely to take years to resolve, but South Africa has called for the court to convene in the next few days to issue “provisional measures” calling for a ceasefire. In March 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to halt its offensive in Ukraine, an order which was supposed to be legally binding, but Moscow ignored it anyway. Any such ruling however is likely to significantly sway international public opinion.
“The acts and omissions by Israel complained of by South Africa are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group,” the South African application to open proceedings said.
“Provisional measures are necessary in this case to protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people under the Genocide Convention, which continue to be violated with impunity.”
Article IX of the Genocide Convention allows any state party to the convention to bring a case against another to the ICJ, even if it doesn’t have any direct link to the conflict in question. Last year, the court ruled that the Gambia could bring a genocide claim against Myanmar. The court also ruled in a case between Croatia and Serbia that depriving a people of food, shelter, medical care and other means of subsistence constitutes genocidal acts.
“Genocidal intent is assumed to be the most difficult element to prove, but Israelis in charge of prosecuting this conflict have made a plethora of statements that easily prove the requisite intent to ‘destroy in whole or in part’ the Palestinian population in Gaza,” said Susan Akram, director of the international human rights clinic at Boston University.
As examples, Akram pointed to Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant’s reference to Palestinians in Gaza as “human animals” and Israeli army Major General Ghassan Alian’s subsequent statement that: “Human animals must be treated as such. There will be no electricity and no water [in Gaza], there will only be destruction. You wanted hell, you will get hell.”
Iva Vukušić, assistant professor in international history at Utrecht University, said: “With over 21,000 dead in Gaza, [the South Africans] believe it is time to let a court look at what is going on. The Genocide Convention allows them to do that, because states, globally, don’t have a lot of places to ‘go to’ in these kinds of situations, especially with the Security Council being as polarised and dysfunctional.”
The international criminal court (ICC) is already investigating possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by both Hamas and Israel. While the ICC can prosecute individuals, the ICJ is an arena for adjudicating conflicts between states.
“The ICJ’s provisional measures are legally binding but enforceability is always the problem,” Victor Kattan, assistant professor in public international law at the University of Nottingham, said. “Ultimately, enforcement always returns to the political organs of the UN and they are paralysed. But it’s still symbolic and it’s embarrassing, I’d imagine, for Israel to be facing a genocide claim, given its history.”
Lior Haiat, the spokesperson for Israel’s foreign ministry, issued a swift rejection of South Africa’s case on social media.
“Israel rejects with disgust the blood libel spread by South Africa in its application to the international court of justice,” Haiat said on X, formerly Twitter. “South Africa’s claim lacks both a factual and a legal basis, and constitutes a despicable and contemptuous exploitation of the court.”
“South Africa is cooperating with a terrorist organisation that is calling for the destruction of the State of Israel,” he added, referring to Hamas, whose massacre of hundreds of Israeli civilians on 7 October triggered the war in Gaza.
“I think it is fair to say that a lot of states now use appeals to the ICJ as part of their battles to control global narratives around wars and crises,” said Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group. “Turning to the court and using the word ‘genocide’ is a powerful way to shape international debates about a conflict. But it is notable that the court has sadly failed to halt violence in Myanmar or Ukraine. There is a risk that the ICJ becomes just another platform for public diplomatic disputes and name-calling similar to the UN general assembly.”

Here’s the full Israeli foreign ministry response to news that South Africa has launched a case at the International court of justice (ICJ) accusing Israel of “genocidal” acts in Gaza.
Israel rejects “with disgust” the “blood libel” spread by South Africa in its application to the UN’s top court, Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Lior Haiat posted on social media. He continued:
South Africa’s claim lacks both a factual and a legal basis, and constitutes a despicable and contemptuous exploitation of the Court.
South Africa is cooperating with a terrorist organization that is calling for the destruction of the State of Israel.
The Hamas terrorist organization - which is committing war crimes, crimes against humanity and sought to commit genocide on 7 October - is responsible for the suffering of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by using them as human shields and stealing humanitarian aid from them.
Israel is committed to international law and acts in accordance with it, and directs its military efforts solely against the Hamas terrorist organization and the other terrorist organizations cooperating with Hamas.
Israel has made it clear that the residents of the Gaza Strip are not the enemy, and is making every effort to limit harm to civilians and to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.
We call on the International Court of Justice and the international community to completely reject South Africa’s baseless claims.

It’s 2am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv and we’re about to close this blog. Our live coverage will resume later today. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
South Africa has launched a case against Israel at the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) accusing the state of committing genocide in its military campaign in Gaza. Israel responded to the allegations “with disgust”, calling South Africa’s case a “blood libel” and urging the ICJ to reject it. Any case at the ICJ is likely to take years to resolve, but South Africa has called for the court to convene in the next few days to issue “provisional measures” calling for a ceasefire.
At least 21,507 people have been killed in Gaza since the war with Israel broke out nearly 12 weeks ago, according to Friday figures from the territory’s health ministry. That figure included 187 fatalities over the previous 24 hours. At least 308 people have been killed while sheltering in UN shelters in Gaza since the war began, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees also said.
The UN’s top aid official has “strongly condemned” reports that Israeli troops opened fire on an aid convoy in the Gaza Strip on Thursday. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) had earlier on Friday accused Israel of firing on an aid convoy as it returned from northern Gaza along a route designated by the Israeli army. Martin Griffiths, the UN emergency relief coordinator, said the convoy was fired upon despite being “clearly marked”. “Attacks on humanitarian workers are unlawful,” he added.
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said he is “very concerned” about the growing threat of infectious diseases facing the people of Gaza. Nearly 180,00 people are suffering upper respiratory infections and about 136,400 cases of diarrhoea have been recorded since mid-October, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a social media post on Friday. Half of the diarrhoea cases have been among children aged under five, he said.
The Joe Biden administration has once again bypassed congressional review for weapons sale to Israel. The US state department said secretary of state Antony Blinken informed Congress that he had made a second emergency determination covering a $147.5m sale for equipment required to make the 155mm shells that Israel has already purchased function.
Israel has detained at least 14 Palestinians, including a child, during its latest raids inside the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on Friday. On Thursday the UN published a report deploring what it said was a “rapid deterioration” of human rights in the West Bank and urged Israeli authorities to end violence against the Palestinian population there.
Qatari mediators have told Israel that Hamas has “agreed in principle” to resume talks on the release of further hostages held in Gaza, according to a report by Israel’s Walla news on Friday. But a senior Hamas official later told Al Jazeera there is currently no talk of a hostage exchange before fighting in Gaza stops. Separately, a Hamas official said that a delegation from the militant group was due in Cairo on Friday to look at an Egyptian plan for a ceasefire that would end the war in Gaza.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, is “gravely concerned” about the further spillover of the conflict in Gaza which could have “devastating” consequences for the entire region, his spokesperson has said. In a statement on Friday, Guterres warned of a “continued risk of wider regional conflagration” the longer the conflict in Gaza continues.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it located and destroyed a hideout belonging to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in northern Gaza. An investigation by IDF troops found the apartment, located on the outskirts of Gaza City, as well as a large tunnel system under it which was part of a network used by senior Hamas members, an IDF spokesperson said on Friday.
Iran has announced it has hanged four people it claims were engaged in “sabotage” on behalf of Israel. The three men and one woman had been sentenced to death on charges of “moharebeh”, or “waging war against God”, and “corruption on Earth” through their “collaboration with the Zionist regime”, and were executed in Iran’s north-west province of West Azerbaijan.
Three Palestinian brothers who were detained by Israeli soldiers in Gaza have said they and other men were beaten, stripped to their underwear, burnt with cigarettes and subjected to other forms of mistreatment during their detention.
Sobhi Yaseen, his brothers Sady and Ibrahim told Reuters they were taken by the Israeli military from their homes in northern Gaza in early December, and held for up to two weeks at unknown locations including a military barracks or camp.
Sobhi told the news agency that while he was detained, he was beaten and that his captors were “smoking and putting out cigarettes on our backs, spraying sand and water on us, urinating on us”.
Ibrahim described having his hands bound and being blindfolded as he was held for interrogation. He said he was not allowed to sleep and forced to stand for hours, while soldiers “would hit you alternately in the head and body”.
In response, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson’s office said it was operating “to dismantle Hamas’ military capabilities” and rescue hostages captured by the Palestinian militant group. Detainees were treated in accordance with international law, and were often required to hand over clothes to ensure they were not carrying weapons or explosives, the office said.
The UK ambassador to the United Nations underscored her country’s commitment to Israel’s security during her address to security council members in New York.
Barbara Woodward, speaking at a UN security council meeting earlier today, noted Israel’s need to address the threat posed by Hamas “but too many civilians have been killed”.
She said Israel must comply with international humanitarian law and clearly differentiate between terrorists and civilians during its military actions.
Israel must also stop settler violence immediately and hold the perpetrators accountable, she said, as she urged Israel to adhere to its commitments and cease all settlement activity in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) should demonstrate a genuine commitment to a two-State solution, she added.
Here are some of the latest images we have received from Gaza, Israel and the occupied West Bank.
A Hamas official has responded to Israeli media reports that the militant group has “agreed in principle” to resume talks on a new hostage release deal.
As we reported earlier, a report claimed Qatari mediators have told Israel that Hamas “agrees in principle” to return to the negotiating table to try to reach a deal on the release of further hostages held in Gaza in exchange for a weeks-long pause in fighting.
Osama Hamda, a senior Hamas official, told Al Jazeera that there is currently no talk of a hostage exchange before fighting in Gaza stops.
He added that a possible release of captives in exchange for a month-long ceasefire, a detail that was reported by Israeli media, has not been discussed.
A US citizen living in Egypt was arrested in Kenya after allegedly seeking to join a terrorist organisation in the wake of the Hamas 7 October attacks on Israel, authorities said.
Karrem Nasr, 23, of Lawrenceville, New Jersey, was arrested on 14 December after flying from Egypt to Nairobi, where he was planning to meet with members of the al-Shabaab terrorist group before travelling to train in Somalia, where the terror organisation is based, according to federal prosecutors.
Nasr was “motivated by the heinous terrorist attack perpetrated by Hamas” on 7 October and “devoted himself to waging violent jihad against America and its allies,” they said.
He was returned to the US on Thursday and was scheduled to appear on Friday before a federal magistrate in Manhattan, AP reported. He has been charged with attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organisation, and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
Any case at the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) is likely to take years to resolve, but South Africa has called for the court to convene in the next few days to issue “provisional measures” calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
In March 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to halt its offensive in Ukraine, an order which was supposed to be legally binding, but Moscow ignored it anyway. Any such ruling however is likely to significantly sway international public opinion.
Article IX of the Genocide Convention allows any state party to the convention to bring a case against another to the ICJ, even if it doesn’t have any direct link to the conflict in question. Last year, the court ruled that the Gambia could bring a genocide claim against Myanmar. The court also ruled in a case between Croatia and Serbia that depriving a people of food, shelter, medical care and other means of subsistence constitutes genocidal acts.

There will be no electricity and no water [in Gaza], there will only be destruction. You wanted hell, you will get hell.”
The Joe Biden administration has once again bypassed congressional review for weapons sale to Israel as more than 21,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes since October 7.
On Friday, the US state department said that secretary of state Antony Blinken informed Congress that he had made a second emergency determination covering a $147.5m sale for equipment required to make the 155mm shells that Israel has already purchased function. The State department said:
Given the urgency of Israel’s defensive needs, the secretary notified Congress that he had exercised his delegated authority to determine an emergency existed necessitating the immediate approval of the transfer.
The emergency determination allows the purchase to bypass the requirement of congressional review for foreign military sales.
Earlier this month, Blinken made a similar decision, approving $106m worth of 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition to Israel.

Palestine’s foreign ministry has welcomed South Africa’s decision to launch a case at the International Court of Justice in which it accused Israel of “genocidal” acts in Gaza.
In a statement released on Friday, Palestine’s foreign ministry said:
Israel’s stated policy, acts and omissions are genocidal in character [,] are committed with the requisite specific intent to the destruction of the Palestinian people under its colonial occupation and apartheid regime in violation of its obligations under the Genocide Convention. Urgent intervention and action is needed to protect against and prevent further harm [t]o the Palestinian people.
The court must immediately take action to protect the Palestinian people and call on Israel, the occupying power, to halt its onslaught against the Palestinian people, in order to ensure an objective legal resolution.”

UN reports surge in people fleeing to Rafah as fighting intensifies – as it happened,2023-12-31,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/dec/30/israel-gaza-war-live-hamas-palestinians-khan-younis-deaths-un-aid-us,"This blog is now closed
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has told the BBC that it estimates that at least 100,000 people have moved into Rafah, the most southerly city in Gaza, in the last few days as fighting has intensified in and around Khan Younis and elsewhere.
The displacement follows orders from Israeli forces urging civilians to flee parts of Gaza where Israel says Hamas has a stronghold.
The OCHA says the influx of people has made overcrowding worse and put pressure on limited resources.
Speaking from Rafah in southern Gaza, the director of UNRWA, the UN’s relief agency, Tom White told the BBC there are “well over a million people” seeking safety in the city.
As a consequence of overcrowding, White said thousands of people are sleeping outside “under flimsy pieces of plastic”.
This blog is now closing and a new one will open later today, but for all of our latest updates – see our full coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, and a summary of the key events so far.
Here is where things stand:
The Organization for Islamic Cooperation has “welcomed” South Africa’s decision to launch a case at the International Court of Justice in which it accuses Israel of carrying out “genocidal” acts across Gaza. According to Qatari news agency QNA, the 57-member OIC, which Qatar is a part of, stressed that Israel is “committing a genocide by its indiscriminate targeting of civilian population … forcibly displacing them, preventing them from obtaining basic needs and humanitarian aid, and destroying buildings and health, educational and religious facilities”.
Tim Kaine, a US Democratic senator representing Virginia, has condemned the Biden administration’s arms transfer to Israel, joining a handful of other Democrats who are criticizing Biden for bypassing congressional review in the foreign transfer of weapons. Kaine’s criticism comes as Israeli strikes have killed more than 21,600 Palestinians across Gaza since 7 October, while internally displacing more than 1.9 million survivors from their homes.
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Nentanyahu, said that the border zone between the Gaza Strip and Egypt should be under Israel’s control. During a press conference on Saturday, Netanyahu said, “The Philadelphi corridor - or to put it more correctly, the southern stoppage point [of Gaza] - must be in our hands. It must be shut. It is clear that any other arrangement would not ensure the demilitarisation that we seek,” Reuters reports.
In a tweet ahead, the World Food Programme warned that “there is a different kind of countdown in Gaza”, pointing to an impending famine across the strip as a result of Israel’s attacks. “We are racing against time to avert a complete collapse of even the most basic services and starvation for millions,” the WFP said.
Israeli forces shot and killed a 22-year-old Palestinian man in the West Bank on Saturday, the Palestinian health ministry announced. The man, identified by Palestinian news agency WAFA as Mohammad Hussein Masalma, was killed by Israeli forces who fired live ammunition at the entrance of the al-Fawwar refugee camp in the south of Hebron, WAFA reports.
Palestine’s ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot, has hailed South Africa’s decision to launch a case against Israel in the International Court of Justice in which it accused Israel of carrying out “genocidal” acts in Gaza. In a tweet on Saturday, Zomlot wrote: “Justice must be served and the #genocide must stop.”
The Palestinian Liberation Front’s armed wing announced on Saturday that an Israeli soldier it was holding captive had been killed in an Israeli airstrike, which also injured some of his captors, Reuters reports. According to an audio speech broadcast by Al Araby television, an Abu Ali Mustafa brigades spokesperson said that the Israeli airstrike occurred after a failed attempt by Israeli forces to rescue the soldier.
Forty percent of Gaza’s population is at risk of famine, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency said on Saturday. “Every day is a struggle for survival, finding food and water,” the UN agency for Palestinian refugees added.
Here are some images coming through the newswires from Gaza, where more than 21,600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes since 7 October and displaced survivors grapple with shortages of food, water, medical supplies and fuel:
Cultural and health workers in Chicago gathered over the weekend in front of the Art Institute of Chicago to publicly mourn hundreds of Palestinian workers from those industries who have been killed by Israeli strikes.
In a post on Saturday, the Jewish peace advocacy group Jewish Voice for Peace called for a ceasefire in Gaza, adding: “Their names will be remembered.”

The Organization for Islamic Cooperation has “welcomed” South Africa’s decision to launch a case at the International Court of Justice in which it accuses Israel of carrying out “genocidal” acts across Gaza.
According to Qatari news agency QNA, the 57-member OIC, which Qatar is a part of, stressed that Israel is “committing a genocide by its indiscriminate targeting of civilian population … forcibly displacing them, preventing them from obtaining basic needs and humanitarian aid, and destroying buildings and health, educational and religious facilities”.
It added that the OIC called on the International Court of Justice to “respond swiftly and take urgent measures to put an end to the genocide committed by the Israeli occupation forces in the occupied Palestinian territory”.
South Africa’s decision to file a case against Israel earlier this week comes as Israeli strikes have killed more than 21,600 Palestinians across the densely populated Gaza strip – which human rights organizations have described as an “open-air prison” – since 7 October.
Tim Kaine, a US Democratic senator representing Virginia, has condemned the Joe Biden administration’s arms transfer to Israel, joining a handful of other Democrats who are criticizing Biden for bypassing congressional review in the foreign transfer of weapons.
Kaine’s criticism comes as Israeli strikes have killed more than 21,600 Palestinians across Gaza since 7 October, while internally displacing more than 1.9 million survivors from their homes.
The Guardian’s Edward Helmore reports:
Virginia senator Tim Kaine has added his voice to a rising chorus within the Democratic party questioning the Biden administration’s legislatively unconstrained transfer of US munitions to Israel.
In a news release on Saturday, the Democratic senator – a member of the Senate armed services committee – said weapons transfers must come under congressional oversight.
“Just as Congress has a crucial role to play in all matters of war and peace, Congress should have full visibility over the weapons we transfer to any other nation. Unnecessarily bypassing Congress means keeping the American people in the dark,” Kaine wrote.
“We need a public explanation of the rationale behind this decision – the second such decision this month,” he added.
On Friday, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had approved the sale of 155mm projectiles and related equipment valued at $147.5m, an increase from an earlier approved order for tens of thousands of rounds of the heavy artillery munitions.

Here are some images coming through the newswires of pro-Palestine rallies held around the world this weekend, in which thousands of protestors called for a ceasefire in Gaza, where more than 21,600 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes:
The Palestine Red Crescent Society has transferred more than five injured Palestinians after an Israeli strike hit a house in the Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza, the PRCS said on Saturday.

Here are some images coming through the newswires from Tel Aviv, where hundreds of anti-government protestors gathered on Saturday night to demand the release of hostages held by Hamas and a ceasefire in Israel’s war on Gaza:
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Nentanyahu, said that the border zone between the Gaza strip and Egypt should be under Israel’s control.
During a press conference on Saturday, Netanyahu said, “The Philadelphi corridor - or to put it more correctly, the southern stoppage point [of Gaza] - must be in our hands. It must be shut. It is clear that any other arrangement would not ensure the demilitarisation that we seek,” Reuters reports.
He went on to threaten to attack Iran directly over the exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border, saying, “If Hezbollah expands the warfare, it will suffer blows that it has not dreamed of - and so too Iran.”
With more than 21,600 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since 7 October, Israel forces have expanded their ground operations across the strip, where more than 1.9 million surviving Palestinians have been displaced as a result.
The Guardian’s Emma Graham-Harrison reports:
Israeli planes bombed refugee camps in Gaza on Saturday as troops expanded ground operations and tens of thousands of Palestinians fled their homes, setting the stage for a new year as bloody and destructive as the last three months of 2023.
The threat of wider escalation also looms large over the region, as skirmishes on the northern boundary with Lebanon intensify, and Israeli officials have hinted that the “diplomatic hourglass” is running out to reach a negotiated solution.
For now there seems little hope of even a temporary break in attacks, even after Egypt hosted leaders for talks this week and pushed plans for a staged break in the war.
A senior Hamas official told AP on Saturday they are firm in their position that there will be no hostage releases without a permanent ceasefire. Israel will not accept ending a war its leaders describe as existential and “without limit”.
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says Hamas must be destroyed after the brutal attacks of 7 October, when gunmen broke into Israel and murdered 1,200 people, the majority civilians.
The scale of death and suffering inside Gaza has isolated Israel internationally, with even allies like the UK now calling for a “sustainable ceasefire”. More than 21,600 people have been killed in Gaza, the majority women and children, and thousands more buried under the rubble, health authorities in the Hamas-run strip say.
For the full story, click here:
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Saturday that Israel was “fighting on all fronts” in a war which he said would last many more months until victory is achieved, Reuters reports.
Netanyahu’s address came as Israel entered its 13th week of war on Gaza during which it has killed over 21,500 Palestinians in what it has declared as its fight against Hamas.
In a new tweet ahead of the new year, the World Food Programme warned that “there is a different kind of countdown in Gaza”, pointing to an impending famine across the strip as a result of Israel’s attacks.
“We are racing against time to avert a complete collapse of even the most basic services and starvation for millions,” the WFP said.
“Only a long-term ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access can end this,” it added.

The international court of justice will hold public hearings on the request for the indication of provisional measures submitted by South Africa in its case against Israel over “genocidal” acts in Gaza next week.
In a press release on Wednesday, the ICJ said that it will hold public hearings at the Peace Palace in The Hague next Thursday and Friday.
It added:
“The hearings will be devoted to the request for the indication for provisional measures contained in South Africa’s application.
In its request, South Africa asks the court to indicate provisional measures in order to ‘protect against further, severe, and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people under the Genocide Convention’ and ‘to ensure Israel’s compliance with its obligations under the Genocide Convention not to engage in genocide, and to prevent and punish genocide.’”

It’s 5:11am in Gaza and Tel Aviv and this blog is now closing. But first, here’s a summary of today’s main developments:
US secretary of state Antony Blinken will leave Thursday evening on his fourth crisis trip to the Middle East, an official has told Agence France-Presse and Reuters news agency. The trip will include Israel, the US official said on condition of anonymity, but did not offer any further detail. On previous trips, Blinken has visited a number of Arab countries too.
Israel carried out the strike that killed Hamas’s deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut, Lebanon, a US defense department official told Agence France-Presse anonymously on Wednesday. “The strike was an Israeli strike,” said the official, without providing further details. On Tuesday, al-Arouri was killed in Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for al-Arouri’s killing.
A local Hezbollah official and two other members were killed on Wednesday in an Israeli strike on southern Lebanon, Reuters reports two security sources saying. Wednesday’s strike bring the death toll in Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon to nine Hezbollah members since the Iran-backed group began exchanging fire with Israeli forces at the start of October.
The United States sees no “clear desire” by either Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement or Israel to go to war with the other, a senior Biden administration official has told Reuters. The official was briefing reporters on condition of anonymity and referring to a speech earlier in the day by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on the assassination on Tuesday of a senior Hamas official in Beirut.
Twelve nations led by the United States on Wednesday have jointly warned Yemen’s Houthi rebels of consequences unless they immediately halt sea attacks that have been disrupting global commerce. President Joe Biden’s administration described the statement – joined by Britain, Germany and Japan – as a final warning, as Biden weighs possible military strikes against the Houthis if attacks persist, Agence France-Presse reports.
The US said that it is “not seeing any acts that constitute genocide” in Gaza, referring to South Africa’s case against Israel in the international court of justice in which it accused Israel of “genocidal” acts across Gaza. In a news briefing on Wednesday, US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, “Those are allegations that should not be made lightly ... we are not seeing any acts that constitute genocide … That is a determination by the state department.” Miller’s comments come as Israeli strikes have killed over 22,300 Palestinians across Gaza – which human rights organisations have described as an “open air prison” – since 7 October.

It added: “The hearings will be devoted to the request for the indication for provisional measures contained in South Africa’s application.”
Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, has condemned what he called “inflammatory” comments made by two Israeli ministers who said Palestinians should emigrate from Gaza. In a tweet on Wednesday, Borrell wrote: “I strongly condemn the inflammatory & irresponsible statements by Israeli ministers Ben Gvir & Smotrich slandering the Palestinian population of Gaza & calling for a plan for their emigration.
A Qatari aircraft carrying 37 tons of aid for Palestinians in Gaza arrived in El Arish, Egypt, on Wednesday. The aid includes shelter kits and food items that will be further transferred to Gaza, the Qatari foreign ministry said in an announcement. Wednesday’s aircraft delivery brings the total amount of aid planes sent from Qatar to Gaza to 58, with a total of 1,814 tons of aid.
The US coordinated with Israel, Egypt and others in rescuing the mother of a US serviceman and her American brother-in-law in Gaza, the Associated Press (AP) is reporting. The news agency says it’s the only known operation of its kind to extract American citizens and their close family members during the months of fighting and Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.
A senior official in the US Education Department has stepped down, citing President Joe Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza, Reuters is reporting, in the latest sign of dissent in the administration over the war.
And here are the latest images coming out of Israel as the fighting continues from the southern border and the remaining damage from the 7 October Hamas attacks can still be seen:

Let’s get a bit more background on the newly announced visit to Israel by the US secretary of state Antony Blinken.
He will leave Thursday evening on his fourth crisis trip to the Middle East, an official has told Agence France-Presse.
The trip will include Israel, the US official said on condition of anonymity, but did not offer any further detail. On previous trips, Blinken has visited a number of Arab countries too.
It will mark the US secretary of state’s fourth trip to the region and fifth to Israel – excluding a visit accompanying President Joe Biden – since Hamas carried out the 7 October attacks.
The announcement of this trip comes after a suspected Israeli strike killed a top Hamas leader in the suburbs of Beirut, increasing regional tensions even further.
The United States sees no “clear desire” by either Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement or Israel to go to war with the other, a senior Biden administration official has told Reuters.
The official was briefing reporters on condition of anonymity and referring to a speech earlier in the day by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on the assassination on Tuesday of a senior Hamas official in Beirut. Reuters reports that the official said:
From everything that we can tell, there is no clear desire for Hezbollah to go to war with Israel and vice versa …
However, the tension on the (Israeli-Lebanese) border is there because Hezbollah is firing across the border regularly at the Israelis and the Israelis obviously return fire.
Israel’s Defence Forces (IDF) have posted on X that they have carried out a strike in the southern Lebanese village of Yaroun.
Earlier, Reuters reported that a local Hezbollah official and two other members were killed on Wednesday in an Israeli strike on southern Lebanon, citing two security sources.
Wednesday’s strike brings the death toll in Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon to nine Hezbollah members since the Iran-backed group began exchanging fire with Israeli forces at the start of October.
On Tuesday, Hamas chief Saleh al-Arouri was killed in Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut. Both Hezbollah and Hamas have blamed Israel, with Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah calling the killing “flagrant Israeli aggression”.

The US coordinated with Israel, Egypt and others in rescuing the mother of a US serviceman and her American brother-in-law in Gaza, the Associated Press (AP) is reporting.
The news agency says it’s the only known operation of its kind to extract American citizens and their close family members during the months of fighting and Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.
Citing a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity – AP reports that Zahra Sckak, 44, made it out of Gaza on New Year’s Eve, along with her brother-in-law, Farid Sukaik, an American citizen.
One of Sckak’s three American sons, Spec. Ragi A. Sckak, serves as an infantryman in the US military.
The extraction involved the Israeli military and local Israeli officials who oversee Gaza and the occupied West Bank, the US official told AP. “The United States played solely a liaison and coordinating role between the Sckak family and the governments of Israel and Egypt”.
The state department has said about 300 American citizens, legal permanent residents and their immediate family members remain in Gaza.
A senior official in the US Education Department has stepped down, citing President Joe Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza, Reuters is reporting, in the latest sign of dissent in the administration over the war.
In a letter, Tariq Habash, special assistant in the education department’s office of planning, evaluation and policy development, said: “I cannot stay silent as this administration turns a blind eye to the atrocities committed against innocent Palestinian lives, in what leading human rights experts have called a genocidal campaign by the Israeli government.”
Habash is a Palestinian-American and an expert on student debt. He was appointed early in Biden’s presidency as part of a build-out of the Education Department’s student loan expertise, Reuters says.
State department spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier in the day that the US has not observed acts in Gaza that constitute genocide. His remarks were in response to proceedings launched by South Africa at the International Court of Justice over Israel’s military operations in the territory. Israel also has denied claims of genocide in Gaza.
Reuters is also reporting that 17 Biden re-election campaign staffers have issued a warning in an anonymous letter that Biden could lose voters over the issue. Biden’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reports. 
Germany’s Foreign Office has warned against travelling to Lebanon and asked German citizens to leave the country.
The warning is in the wake of the killing of one of Hamas’s most senior officials, Saleh al-Arouri. He died in Beirut in what was understood to be an Israeli drone strike. Israel has not confirmed or denied it was behind the attack.
The statement from the Germany ministry’s website says:
A further aggravation of the situation and expansion of the conflict cannot be ruled out, especially in view of the killing of the deputy chairman of the Hamas political bureau, Saleh Al-Arouri, in the Beirut area on January 2, 2024
Reuters reports that this applies particularly to the southern parts of Lebanon up to and including the southern urban areas of Beirut.
Israeli hostage Sahar Baruch was killed last month during a rescue attempt by special forces in Gaza, the Israeli military said on Wednesday, without giving details.
Hamas said on 8 December that a hostage it named as Sa’ar Baruch, had been killed during an attempted rescue operation, Reuters reports.
“At this point, it is not possible to determine the circumstances of Sahar’s death, and it is not known whether he was murdered by Hamas or killed by our forces’ fire,” the military said in a statement, according to Reuters.
Sahar Baruch was among the 240 hostages seized by Hamas gunmen when they stormed into southern Israel on 7 October.
More than 100 hostages have since been released under agreements brokered by Qatar and other countries and one hostage was rescued by Israeli forces. At least 123 remain in Gaza, of whom at least 23 have been declared dead by Israeli authorities.
Twelve nations led by the United States on Wednesday have jointly warned Yemen’s Houthi rebels of consequences unless they immediately halt sea attacks that have been disrupting global commerce.
President Joe Biden’s administration described the statement - joined by Britain, Germany and Japan – as a final warning, as Biden weighs possible military strikes against the Houthis if attacks persist, Agence France-Presse reports.
The Iranian-backed rebels, who control much of Yemen including the capital Sana’a and most of the Red Sea coast, have been firing on ships allegedly linked to Israel in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Here’s some of what the joint statement, released by the White House, had to say:
Let our message now be clear: we call for the immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews …
The Huthis will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy and free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways.
The U.S. joins our partners and allies in calling for an immediate end to the Houthi’s illegal attacks against vessels and crews in the Red Sea.We will continue to promote accountability for malign actors responsible for unlawful seizures and attacks.https://t.co/uhGwS18l3w
It is still unclear who is responsible for the double bombing of a crowd in the south-eastern Iranian city of Kerman, but whoever is behind the outrage is clearly willing to risk igniting a regional war.
In Washington, officials have been pointing towards the possible role of Islamic State or some affiliated Sunni extremist group, and away from the partnership of Israel and the secular Iranian rebel group, the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MeK), who have reportedly been behind previous attacks deep inside Iran.
Those earlier attacks have mostly been targeted assassinations, often on scientists, or acts of sabotage. Wednesday’s bombing in Kerman does not fit the pattern, US and UK officials argue. It was aimed at mourners marking the fourth anniversary of the US drone killing of Qassem Suleimani, a commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and arch-foe of Israel and US – but the attack was a horrifically blunt instrument, leaving scores of civilians among the dead, so it would be a remarkable departure for MeK and the Mossad.

Reuters is reporting that the US secretary of state Antony Blinken is to leave Thursday for a visit to Israel and other Middle East countries.
The agency is citing a US official who was briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, and said that Blinken leaves Thursday night “for stops in a number of capitals, including Israel,” but provided no further details.
The official said US diplomatic envoy Amos Hochstein will also travel to Israel to work to soothe tensions between the country and Hezbollah, Reuters reports.
Here is where things stand:
Israel carried out the strike that killed Hamas’s deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut, Lebanon, a US defense department official told Agence France-Presse anonymously on Wednesday. “The strike was an Israeli strike,” said the official, without providing further details.

Wednesday’s strike bring the death toll in Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon to nine Hezbollah members since the Iran-backed group began exchanging fire with Israeli forces at the start of October.
UK foreign secretary David Cameron said that “more must be done to get humanitarian aid into Gaza” and that Israel “must allow significantly more supplies in to reduce the risk of hunger and disease”, Agence France-Presse reports. “The UK also wants to see the immediate release of hostages and progress towards a sustainable ceasefire,” Cameron, who was previously the UK prime minister, said.
The US said that it is “not seeing any acts that constitute genocide” in Gaza, referring to South Africa’s case against Israel in the international court of justice in which it accused Israel of “genocidal” acts across Gaza.

On Tuesday, al-Arouri was killed in Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for al-Arouri’s killing.
Meanwhile, Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari did not comment directly on his killing but said that the Israeli military was “highly prepared for any scenario” in its aftermath, Agence France-Presse reports.
Israeli public figures have accused the country’s judiciary of ignoring incitement to genocide in Gaza where Israeli strikes have killed more than 22,300 Palestinians since 7 October.
The Guardian’s Emma Graham-Harrison and Quique Kierszenbaum reports:
A group of prominent Israelis has accused the country’s judicial authorities of ignoring “extensive and blatant” incitement to genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza by influential public figures.
In a letter to the attorney general and state prosecutors, they demand action to stop the normalisation of language that breaks both Israeli and international law.
“For the first time that we can remember, the explicit calls to commit atrocious crimes, as stated, against millions of civilians have turned into a legitimate and regular part of Israeli discourse,” they write. “Today, calls of these types are an everyday matter in Israel.”
Signatories include one of Israel’s top scientists, the Royal Society member Prof David Harel, alongside other academics, former diplomats, former members of the Knesset, journalists and activists.
Represented by the human rights lawyer Michael Sfard, their 11-page letter contains multiple examples of “the discourse of annihilation, expulsion and revenge”.
The list of elite Israelis who have incited war crimes includes cabinet ministers and Knesset members, former top military officials, academics, media figures, social media influencers and celebrities, the letter says.
A local Hezbollah official and two other members were killed on Wednesday in an Israeli strike on southern Lebanon, Reuters reports two security sources saying.
Wednesday’s strike bring the death toll in Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon to nine Hezbollah members since the Iran-backed group began exchanging fire with Israeli forces at the start of October.

“The UK also wants to see the immediate release of hostages and progress towards a sustainable ceasefire,” Cameron, who was previously the UK prime minister, said.
He added that he discussed the issue with Israel’s new foreign minister Israel Katz.
The first UK maritime shipment of aid to Gaza arrived in Egypt this week, Agence France-Presse reports. According to the British government, the shipment carried nearly 90 tons of thermal blankets, shelter packs and other medical supplies.
The shipment is set to be transferred to the Rafah crossing by the Egyptian Red Crescent and will be distributed by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, across Gaza.
The US said that it is “not seeing any acts that constitute genocide” in Gaza, referring to South Africa’s case against Israel in the international court of justice in which it accused Israel of “genocidal” acts across Gaza.
In a news briefing on Wednesday, US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller responded to a question about South Africa’s request to the ICJ to issue an urgent order declaring that Israel was violating the Genocide Convention by saying:
“Those are allegations that should not be made lightly ... we are not seeing any acts that constitute genocide… That is a determination by the state department.”
Miller’s comments come as Israeli strikes have killed over 22,300 Palestinians across the Gaza – which human rights organizations have described as an “open air prison” - since 7 October. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes have forcibly displaced 1.9 million Palestinian survivors from their homes, leaving them grappling with severe shortages in basic necessities including food, water, fuel and medical supplies.
In November, a group of UN human rights experts warned that “grave violations committed by Israel against Palestinians in the aftermath of 7 October, particularly in Gaza, point to a genocide in the making”.
The ICJ has scheduled public hearings for next Thursday and Friday to hear oral arguments from South Africa and Israel surrounding South Africa’s case.

Benjamin Netanyahu has said he is seeking a “fundamental change” on Israel’s border with Lebanon.
The Israeli prime minister, at a meeting with US special envoy Amos Hochstein, did not specify what his plans entailed, the Associated Press reported.
He said he was committed to resettling evacuated residents from Israel’s north back in their homes safely, adding that he hoped to resolve the conflict with Lebanon diplomatically. He said:
Israel, after the murderous attack on Saturday of October 7, is determined, bolder and more united than ever before. Those of our neighbours who have not yet understood this will understand this very well in the future.
Netanyahu’s comments came days after an audacious Israeli drone strike in Beirut killed a senior Hamas official in a move that threatened a significant and dangerous escalation of Israel’s war against Hamas and its related conflict with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

Several McDonald’s markets in the Middle East and some outside the region were experiencing a “meaningful business impact” due to the Israel-Hamas conflict as well as “associated misinformation” about the brand, CEO Chris Kempczinski has said.
Major Western fast-food chains including McDonald’s and Starbucks have seen largely spontaneous, grassroots boycott campaigns over their perceived pro-Israeli stance and alleged financial ties to Israel, Reuters reported.
Kempczinski said the misinformation surrounding brands like McDonald’s was “disheartening and ill-founded.” In a LinkedIn post he said:
In every country where we operate, including in Muslim countries, McDonald’s is proudly represented by local owner operators who work tirelessly to serve and support their communities while employing thousands of their fellow citizens.
In October, McDonald’s Israel said on its social media accounts that it had given thousands of free meals to Israel Defense Forces personnel.
This was later renounced by McDonald’s franchises in some Muslim countries, highlighting the polarized regional politics that global corporations navigate during war.
Some of the Western brands are feeling the impact of boycotts in Egypt and Jordan that have now caught on in some countries outside the Arab region including Muslim-majority Malaysia.
As of fiscal 2022, the company franchised and operated about 40,275 McDonald’s restaurants across more than 100 countries. The fast-food chain reported total annual revenue of $23.18 billion in the year.
Jordan has launched several aerial raids inside Syria along its border with its northern neighbour against suspected warehouses and hideouts of Iranian-backed drug smugglers, local and regional intelligence sources have said according to Reuters.
The army has stepped up a campaign against drug dealers after protracted clashes last month with dozens of infiltrators from Syria linked to pro-Iranian militias, carrying large hauls who crossed its border with weapons and explosives, the news wire reported.

It’s 1am in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
More than 22,438 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, the majority of them women and children, according to the latest figures from Gaza’s health ministry on Thursday. The figures include 125 Palestinians killed in the past 24 hours. At least 12 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on a home in al-Mawasi evacuation zone, Palestinian hospital officials said. The blast reportedly killed a man and his wife, seven of their children and three other children ranging in age from five to 14.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has said it is deeply concerned for the safety of its staff and others who are sheltering at al-Amal hospital and PRCS headquarters in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. In a statement, the PRCS said the hospital compound has been subject to “repeated direct targeting” by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for the past three days, and that seven people had been killed, including a five-year-old baby.
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said that there will be no Israeli civilian presence in Gaza and Palestinian bodies will be “in charge” of the territory after the war ends. In a statement by his office on Thursday, Gallant also outlined Israel’s new phase in its war on Gaza, including that Israel will “transition to a new combat approach in accordance with military achievements on the ground” in the northern region of the Gaza Strip.
Benjamin Netanyahu has said he is seeking a “fundamental change” on Israel’s border with Lebanon. The Israeli prime minister, at a meeting with US special envoy Amos Hochstein on Thursday, said he was committed to resettling evacuated residents from Israel’s north back in their homes safely. His comments came as thousands of people took to the streets of Beirut for the funeral of one of Hamas’s most senior officials, Saleh al-Arouri, who was killed earlier this week in an Israeli drone strike in the Lebanese capital. Separately, Israel’s defence minister Yoav Gallant said there must be a “new reality” that would allow Israelis who have evacuated from northern areas of the country to return, referring to the repeated exchanges of fire over the UN-drawn blue line that separates Israel and Lebanon.
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for two explosions at a ceremony in Iran to commemorate commander Qassem Suleimani. More than 95 Iranians were killed and scores more injured in the attack on Wednesday, which came at a memorial ceremony marking the fourth anniversary of the killing of Suleimani, the head of Iran’s al-Quds force. The US is “in no position to doubt” the Islamic State’s claim of responsibility, the White House has said.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will depart later today to the Middle East for the fourth time since the Israel-Hamas war began in October. Blinken is set to visit Israel and the occupied West Bank, as well as Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt over the next week, the US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, told reporters.
A US airstrike in Baghdad on Thursday killed the commander of an Iranian-backed Shia militia that Washington blames for attacks on US forces in the region, according to US officials. One official said that a leader of Harakat al-Nujaba, whom the official did not name, was killed in his car as he was about to enter the garage at his group’s Baghdad headquarters.
Several Gulf Arab states have strongly condemned remarks by two Israeli government ministers this week calling for Palestinians to emigrate from Gaza. Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has called on Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could “make the desert bloom” while national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for promoting “a solution to encourage the emigration of Gaza’s residents” and the re-establishment of Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory. The UN’s top human rights official, Volker Türk, said he was “very disturbed” by the statements.
Three Israelis who were considered missing since the Hamas attacks on 7 October are being held hostage in the Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said. This brings the number of people held hostage in Gaza since the attacks on Israel to 132, according to figures provided by Israeli officials.
The IDF said they have killed the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) northern Gaza operations chief, Mamdouh Lolo, in an airstrike in northern Gaza. The IDF said the strike was a joint operation with Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, the Shin Bet. Separately, the IDF said it raided and destroyed a Hamas military compound along the central coast of the Gaza Strip, including an underground tunnel system that led to a facility that was used
At least 120 Palestinians were detained during an Israeli military raid in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarem on Thursday, according to reports. The IDF said they had detained hundreds of people suspected of militant activities.
A Houthi drone boat laden with explosives detonated in the Red Sea on Thursday, a senior US military officer said, just hours after the US and its allies warned the Iran-backed militia group to stop attacks or face “consequences”.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has said it is deeply concerned for the safety of its staff and others who are sheltering at al-Amal hospital and PRCS headquarters in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
In a statement posted to social media, the PRCS said the hospital compound has been subject to “repeated direct targeting” by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for the past three days.
Seven internally displaced people, including a five-year-old baby, were killed during the three days of bombardment, it said. It accused the Israel Defense Forces of targeting several floors of the PRCS compound.
Dozens of others were killed or injured as residential buildings and “gatherings of citizens” at the entrance of the hospital were targeted, it said.
It said the vicinity of al-Amal hospital has been subjected to “intense” shelling for the past two weeks, endangering the lives of thousands of internally displaced people who are “living in an atmosphere of horror and panic”. These displaced people took refuge in the hospital compound “as a safe place protected by international humanitarian law”, it said.
The head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has begun the process of appointing a team to investigate the events leading up to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October.
IDF chief of staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi has formed a team of former military officials to investigate the army’s failures that led to the Hamas attacks.
The team includes Israel’s former defence minister and IDF chief of staff Lt Gen Shaul Mofaz, former IDF intelligence chief Maj Gen Aharon Zeevi Farkash, former IDF southern command chief Sami Turgeman, and former IDF operations directorate chief Yoav Har-Even, the Times of Israel reported.
The IDF told the paper that it has not yet begun the investigation but that the process “is being formulated”.
Top IDF officials are expected to resign at some point this year over the failure to prevent Hamas’s invasion, the Jerusalem Post reported.
Thousands of people took to the streets of Beirut on Thursday for the funeral of one of Hamas’s most senior officials, Saleh al-Arouri, who was killed earlier this week in an Israeli drone strike in the Lebanese capital.
The coffins of Arouri along with those of two leaders from Al Qassam brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, Mohammad al-Rais and Azzam al-Aqraa Abu Ammar, were draped in Palestinian and Hamas flags, Agence France-Presse reported. They were first taken to a mosque for prayers before being carried to the Palestine martyrs cemetery in Beirut, Associated Press reported.
The funeral was attended by Palestinian officials, including top Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk, as well as representatives of some Lebanese political groups.
Arouri and the six other Hamas members were killed in a strike on an apartment in Beirut’s southern Musharafieh district, a stronghold of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. Arouri is the most senior Hamas figure to be killed since the war broke out on 7 October after Hamas attacked Israel.
He was a key figure in the group and seen as close to Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza. Regarded as the principal interlocutor between Hamas and Hezbollah, not least with Hezbollah’s secretary general, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, he was also an important figure in the group’s financial network.
Arouri’s assassination is likely to complicate negotiations between Hamas and Israel over the hostages Hamas holds in Gaza, with Arouri described as playing a key role in negotiations for the captives’ release.
He had also been implicated in directing a number of attacks against Israel. In 2014 Israel accused him of being behind the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers, which led to that year’s conflict in the coastal strip, and he was designated by the US for his role in terrorism in September 2015.
Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, has said Israel’s ambassador to Spain will be sent back to Madrid after she was recalled in November in a diplomatic spat between Tel Aviv and Madrid.
Rodica Radian-Gordon had been recalled by Israel’s then foreign minister, Eli Cohen, after comments made by Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. In an interview, Sánchez said he had “serious doubts” over the legality of Israel’s actions in Gaza.
But Katz, Cohen’s successor, said today he had decided to send her back to Madrid because there “was a change in the messages for the better” from the Spanish government.
The aim was also to garner support “for the right of the state of Israel to protect its citizens against the terrorist organisation Hamas” and to secure more “international pressure for the release of hostages”, he said.
Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Lebanon.
Three Israelis who were considered missing since the Hamas attacks on 7 October are being held hostage in the Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said.
This brings the number of people held hostage in Gaza since the attacks on Israel to 132, according to figures provided by Israeli officials.
IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters:
Three citizens who were considered missing are now recognised as hostages and their families have been informed.
Benjamin Netanyahu has said he is seeking a “fundamental change” on Israel’s border with Lebanon.
The Israeli prime minister, at a meeting with US special envoy Amos Hochstein, did not specify what his plans entailed, the Associated Press reported.
He said he was committed to resettling evacuated residents from Israel’s north back in their homes safely, adding that he hoped to resolve the conflict with Lebanon diplomatically. He said:
Israel, after the murderous attack on Saturday of October 7, is determined, bolder and more united than ever before. Those of our neighbours who have not yet understood this will understand this very well in the future.
Netanyahu’s comments came days after an audacious Israeli drone strike in Beirut killed a senior Hamas official in a move that threatened a significant and dangerous escalation of Israel’s war against Hamas and its related conflict with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
In a statement released by his office on Thursday, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant outlined Israel’s new phase in its war on Gaza, saying:
“In the northern region of the Gaza strip, we will transition to a new combat approach in accordance with military achievements on the ground.”
Gallant added that Israel’s operations would include raids, demolishing tunnels, air and ground strikes, and special forces operations, Reuters reports.
He added that Israel’s military operation in the south “will continue for as long as is deemed necessary”.
Since 7 October, Israeli strikes have killed more than 22,400 Palestinians while leaving 1.9 million survivors internally displaced amid severe shortages in food, water, fuel and medical supplies.
Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said that there will be no Israeli civilian presence in Gaza and Palestinian bodies will be “in charge” of the territory after the war ends. In a statement by his office on Thursday, Gallant said Hamas would no longer control Gaza and Israel would reserve its operational freedom of action.
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for two explosions at a ceremony in Iran to commemorate commander Qassem Suleimani. More than 95 Iranians were killed and scores more injured in the attack on Wednesday, which came at a memorial ceremony marking the fourth anniversary of the killing of Suleimani, the head of Iran’s al-Quds force. The US is “in no position to doubt” the Islamic State’s claim of responsibility, the White House has said.
More than 22,438 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, the majority of them women and children, according to the latest figures from Gaza’s health ministry on Thursday. The figures include 125 Palestinians killed in the past 24 hours. At least 12 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on a home in al-Mawasi evacuation zone, Palestinian hospital officials said. The blast reportedly killed a man and his wife, seven of their children and three other children ranging in age from five to 14.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will depart later today to the Middle East for the fourth time since the Israel-Hamas war began in October. Blinken is set to visit Israel and the occupied West Bank, as well as Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt over the next week, the US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, told reporters.
A US airstrike in Baghdad on Thursday killed the commander of an Iranian-backed Shia militia that Washington blames for attacks on American forces in the region, according to US officials. One official said that a leader of Harakat al-Nujaba, whom the official did not name, was killed in his car as he was about to enter the garage at his group’s Baghdad headquarters.
Several Gulf Arab states have strongly condemned remarks by two Israeli government ministers this week calling for Palestinians to emigrate from Gaza.

The UN’s top human rights official, Volker Türk, said he was “very disturbed” by the statements.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they had killed the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) northern Gaza operations chief, Mamdouh Lolo, in an airstrike in northern Gaza. The IDF said the strike was a joint operation with Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, the Shin Bet. Separately, the IDF said it raided and destroyed a Hamas military compound along the central coast of the Gaza Strip, including an underground tunnel system that led to a facility that was used by Hamas to manufacture weapons.
The UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, has warned Israel it must allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza to avoid starvation and large outbreaks of disease. Speaking during a trip in Kosovo, Cameron also said attacks in Red Sea shipping lanes must stop, otherwise international action will be taken.
Israel has accused the UN of “stalling” the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, the territory which Israel has held under a virtual siege and continual aerial bombardment since 7 October. The Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs said it was equipped to inspect up to 200 trucks a day passing through the Kerem Shalom crossing, but the UN was “not scraping 100”.
At least 120 Palestinians were detained during an Israeli military raid in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarem on Thursday, according to reports. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they had detained hundreds of people suspected of militant activities.
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said there must be a “new reality” that would allow Israelis who have evacuated from northern areas of the country to return. He was referring to the repeated exchanges of fire over the UN-drawn blue line that separates Israel and Lebanon.

In a statement by his office, reported by Reuters, Gallant said Hamas would no longer control Gaza and Israel would reserve its operational freedom of action. He was quoted as saying:
Gaza residents are Palestinian, therefore Palestinian bodies will be in charge, with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the State of Israel.”
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it raided and destroyed a Hamas military compound along the central coast of the Gaza Strip, including an underground tunnel system that stretched for hundreds of metres.
According to the IDF, one of the tunnels led to a facility that was used by Hamas to manufacture weapons. The IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the facility had been used to create long-range rockets and was stocked with explosives, adding:
The damage to the production sites and Hamas’s rocket launch capability and its reduction, as is carried out throughout the war, continues to be one of the main objectives of the military operation.”
The US is “in no position to doubt” a claim by Islamic State that it was responsible for an attack in southern Iran that killed dozens on Wednesday, the White House has said.
The White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters at a briefing today that the US has “long said and maintained” that IS “remains a viable terror threat”.
The head of the UN interim forces in Lebanon said he has met with Lebanese officials to discuss the situation in southern Lebanon.
Posting to social media, Aroldo Lázaro said he met with the Lebanese speaker, Nabih Berri, the caretaker prime minister, Najib Miqati, and army commander Joseph Aoun. He wrote:
I expressed my concern about the situation and breaches in the cessation of hostilities, including potential miscalculation, which could have devastating consequences. Our priorities are to prevent escalation, protect civilian lives, and ensure peacekeepers’ safety and security.”

Several Gulf Arab states have strongly condemned remarks by two Israeli government ministers this week calling for Palestinians to emigrate from Gaza.
We reported earlier that the UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, said he was “very disturbed” by the statements made earlier this week by Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, and national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir.
On Monday, Ben-Gvir called for promoting “a solution to encourage the emigration of Gaza’s residents” and the re-establishment of Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory. A day earlier, Smotrich had said Palestinians should leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could “make the desert bloom”.
In a statement today, Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry said it “categorically condemns and rejects the comments of the two ministers”. It called on the international community to act in the face of the Israeli government’s “persistence” in violating international law “through its statements and actions”.
Qatar also “condemned in the strongest terms” the comments by the two Israeli ministers, its foreign ministry said, adding:
The policy of collective punishment and forced displacement practised by the occupation authorities against the inhabitants of Gaza will not change the fact that Gaza is Palestinian land and will remain Palestinian.”
Kuwait warned against “Israeli plans to displace Gaza residents in particular, and the Palestinian people in general”.
The United Arab Emirates, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020, also “condemned in the strongest terms the extremist statements” of the two ministers, AFP reported.
The UAE voiced its “categorical rejection of such offensive statements and of all practices ... which threaten further escalation and instability in the region”, the foreign ministry said in a statement.
The US, France and the EU have also denounced the comments.

"Unauthorised Jewish settlements surge in occupied West Bank, says watchdog – as it happened",2024-01-06,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/05/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-antony-blinken-israel-palestine-gaza-hamas,"This blog is now closed. Our full report on the latest developments in the Middle East is here and all our Israel-Gaza war coverage here


While the world’s attention has been focused on war in Gaza, Jewish settlers have quietly carried out an “unprecedented surge” of unauthorised moves in the occupied West Bank, an Israeli watchdog group has warned.
A report by Peace Now found that settlers have established a record number of nine unauthorised settlement outposts since the start of the war in October. The group’s team said it had also documented the creation of more than a dozen new dirt paths and roads.
“The three months of war in Gaza are being exploited by settlers to establish facts on the ground,” the report said.
The group said that settlers were “disregarding the legal status of the land” by constructing outposts on private Palestinian lands and restricting Palestinian movement in the West Bank. The report continued:
The permissive military and political environment allow the reckless construction and land seizure almost unchecked, with minimal adherence to the law. The result is not only physical harm to Palestinians and their lands but also a significant political shift in the West Bank.
Most of the new outposts consist only of a few tents and an Israeli flag, the report said. But many such outposts have evolved into more permanent developments over the years.
Israel’s coalition government is dominated by supporters of the settler movement, including those who want to annex some or all of the West Bank. Most countries view all settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem to be a violation of international law.
It’s 2am in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut and we’re about to close this blog. Our live coverage will continue later in the day. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
At least 22,600 Palestinians have been killed and 57,910 wounded in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Friday. About 162 Palestinians were killed and 296 wounded in the past 24 hours, the ministry added. At least six people have been killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike on a home in the southern Gaza city of Rafah overnight.
The UN humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, has described the Gaza Strip as having become “uninhabitable” after relentless bombing by Israeli forces. In a statement, Griffiths warned that a “public health disaster is unfolding” in the territory as people are facing “the highest levels of food insecurity ever recorded”. “Famine is around the corner,” he added.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has said it is “appalled” by the “continuous” shelling of al-Amal hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) headquarters in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. In a statement on Friday, the IFRC said these strikes had resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day-old infant, and that one of its medics had been injured.
The head of Unicef has said time is running out for children in Gaza who are “caught in a nightmare that worsens with every passing day”. Children in the territory face a “deadly triple threat” to their lives from the spread of diseases, plummeting nutrition and the escalation in fighting, Catherine Russell said in a statement, adding that most young children and women in the Gaza Strip are unable to meet their basic nutrition needs.
The governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda have denied a report that they have been in talks with Israel over taking in thousands of Palestinians from Gaza. According to the report, the Israeli government has been conducting secret talks with multiple countries regarding a “voluntary” migration scheme for Palestinians. The report came as two far-right Israeli ministers earlier this week called for the resettlement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has arrived in Turkey to start his fourth Middle East tour since the Israel-Gaza war broke out three months ago. Blinken will also travel to Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the West Bank and Egypt. The head of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, said he hoped Blinken’s visit will focus on ending aggression in the region.
France and Jordan teamed up to airdrop seven tonnes of aid to civilians and aid workers in Gaza late on Thursday, the French presidency has said. The “extremely complex” operation involved supplies equipped with systems that remotely guided them to a Jordanian field hospital set up in Gaza’s second city, Khan Younis, it said.
Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, warned against an Israeli occupation of Gaza as she called for more humanitarian pauses in the war. Israel “must do more for the protection of the civilian population” in its war against Hamas in Gaza, Baerbock said at a press conference on Friday. She is expected to travel to Israel on Sunday for her fourth visit since the outbreak of the Gaza war.
Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, has urged the UK government to demand an end to Israel’s “indiscriminate attacks” that have killed thousands of children in Gaza. In a statement on Friday, Yousaf said it was time for the UK to make clear to Israel that its actions in Gaza had gone “way beyond a legitimate response” to the 7 October Hamas attacks.
Hezbollah’s head, Hassan Nasrallah, has said that the assassination of one of Hamas’s most senior officials, Saleh al-Arouri, in Beirut has changed the nature of the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. In a second nationally televised address within three days, Nasrallah warned that a response is “inevitable”, further heightening fears of a dangerous escalation in the conflict. His comments came as Lebanon issued a formal complaint to the UN security council over al-Arouri’s killing, and over Israeli incursions into Lebanon’s airspace to attack targets in Syria.
Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, has warned that time is running out on diplomatic efforts to end tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. Gallant, during a situational assessment at the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) northern command base on Friday, said that Israel would soon be left with no choice but to launch a military offensive against Hezbollah.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Friday that it carried out an airstrike on a Hezbollah command centre in the southern Lebanese village of Blida in response to attacks on the border. IDF tanks and artillery also shelled a number of areas along the Israel-Lebanon border, apparently to foil planned Hezbollah attacks, it said.
The commander-in-chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said at the funeral on Friday for the victims of twin Islamic State bombings that their deaths would be avenged. More than 84 people were killed at a memorial in the city of Kerman on Wednesday for the former top commander Qassem Suleimani, who was assassinated in Iraq in 2020 by a US drone. Iranian security forces have detained 11 people suspected of links to the attack, Iran’s intelligence ministry said on Friday. The US has reportedly collected communications intercepts that confirm the Islamic State was behind the attacks.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, will be in Lebanon from 5 to 7 January to discuss the situation at the Israeli-Lebanese border and the importance of avoiding regional escalation, the EU said in a statement. Borrell will meet the speaker of the parliament, Nabih Berri; the prime minister, Najib Mikati, the foreign minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, and the armed forces commander Gen Joseph Aoun. He will also have an exchange with the head of the UN’s interim force in Lebanon, Gen Aroldo Lázaro.
A Turkish court has decided to formally arrest 15 people and deport eight others suspected of being linked to Mossad, Israel’s national intelligence agency. Turkey warned Israel last month of “serious consequences” if it tried to hunt down members of Hamas on Turkish soil.
Jewish settlers have quietly carried out an “unprecedented surge” of unauthorised moves in the occupied West Bank while the world’s attention has been focused on war in Gaza, an Israeli watchdog group has warned. The result has been “not only physical harm to Palestinians and their lands but also a significant political shift in the West Bank”, a report said.
The UN’s migration agency has launched an urgent appeal for $69m (£54m) to support its response to rising and critical humanitarian needs in the occupied Palestinian territories.
In a statement, the International Organization for Migration (IMO) said hundreds of thousands of civilians need aid desperately, but that getting help to them continues to be hampered by “long clearance procedures for humanitarian aid trucks at the border (and) the intense ground operation and fighting”.
“Frequent disruption” to communication networks has also prevented humanitarian aid coordination, it said, as has “insecurity, blocked roads and scarcity of fuel”.

The government of Rwanda has also denied the report that it has discussed with Israel the possibility of taking in Palestinians from Gaza.
In a social media post, Rwanda’s foreign ministry said the report – which we reported earlier – was “completely false”, adding that:
No such discussion has taken place either now or in the past, and the disinformation should be ignored.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo has denied a report that it is in talks with Israel over taking in thousands of Palestinians from Gaza.
According to a report in Zman Israel, the Israeli government has been conducting secret talks with multiple countries regarding a “voluntary” migration scheme for Palestinians.
“Congo will be willing to take in migrants,” a senior source in the security cabinet told the outlet.
But a spokesperson for the Congolese government said there has “never been any form of negotiation, discussion or initiative” with Israel about taking in Palestinian migrants, the Times of Israel reported.
The paper also cited a senior Israeli official dismissing the report as a “baseless illusion”. “Israel is not conducting any talks with any country on this issue,” the official said.
The head of the World Health Organization has warned of the number of people in Gaza who have suffered “life-changing” amputations as a result of the war.
In a social media post, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the lack of treatment and experts means that people “are having all or parts of their arms and legs removed, sometimes with insufficient and anesthesia and pain relief”.
He said the WHO is working with local partners in Gaza to deliver supplies and assess needs, but that “much more is required”, adding that “this suffering needs to end”.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has said it is “appalled” by the “continuous” shelling of al-Amal hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) headquarters in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
In a statement on Friday, the IFRC said these strikes had resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day-old infant.
One of the group’s volunteer medics was injured in the strike, it said, in addition to 26 others who have been injured since 7 October and four colleagues who have been killed in the line of duty.
Al-Amal hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south of the Gaza Strip, is marked by the Red Crescent emblem, it said, which “guarantee[s] protection in times of conflict and disaster”.
The continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.
Former US vice-president Mike Pence has visited the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) northern command near Israel’s border with Lebanon on Friday.
During his visit, he received an operational update and met with reserve soldiers, according to an IDF statement.
Traveled to Israel’s Northern Command today to meet with military leaders and joined @IDF soldiers stationed near Israel’s border with Lebanon. Ever since October 7th, these courageous Israelis, several of whom are also American citizens, left families and home to stand strong… pic.twitter.com/2vj3mmArSl
France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, has said that Gaza is Palestinian land and its future will not be decided by Israel.
Speaking to CNN, Colonna said:
It’s not up to Israel to determine the future of Gaza, which is Palestinian land. We need to return to the principle of international law and respect it.
Her comments came after two far-right Israeli ministers earlier this week called for the resettlement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.
On Wednesday, Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, doubled down on a call for “voluntary emigration” by Palestinians from Gaza.
Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, on Monday called for promoting “a solution to encourage the emigration of Gaza’s residents”.
Such calls are “irresponsible” and “brings us away from a solution,” Colonna said, adding that such rhetoric is also against the long-term interests of Israel. She added:
Gaza is Palestinian land, which wants to become part of the future Palestinian state. We support the two-state solution, which is the only viable option. Gaza and the West Bank must together be part of the future Palestinian state.
Here are some of the latest images we have received over the newswires from Gaza, Israel, and Yemen.
Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, has urged the UK government to demand an end to Israel’s “indiscriminate attacks” that have seen thousands of children in Gaza killed.
In a statement on Friday, Yousaf said the UK government’s refusal to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza was “shameful”.
It was time for the UK to make clear to Israel that its actions in Gaza had gone “way beyond a legitimate response” to the 7 October Hamas attacks, he said.
He also described comments by Israeli ministers earlier this week calling for the resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza as “deeply disturbing” and said they should be “universally condemned”, adding:
Gaza is Occupied Palestinian Territory and will be part of a future Palestinian state - Gazans should not be subject to forcible displacement or relocation from Gaza.
The Scottish leader said the UK government should make clear that Israeli officials, including Benjamin Netanyahu, will be held accountable for “the killing of thousands of innocent civilians and the deaths of tens of thousands more from starvation and disease” if Israel does not “immediately cease indiscriminate attacks” and allow aid to enter Gaza. He added:
Talk of a sustainable ceasefire from the UK Government has made no difference on the ground, as the situation has worsened for the people of Gaza. The UK government must use its voice and influence to stop the killing – directly with the Israeli government, and indirectly with the US.

Palestinians desperate to flee Gaza pay thousands in bribes to ‘brokers’,2024-01-08,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/08/palestinians-flee-gaza-rafah-egypt-border-bribes-to-brokers,"Fixers with alleged links to Egyptian intelligence are making a fortune in ‘fees’ from people hoping to exit through the Rafah crossing
Palestinians desperate to leave Gaza are paying bribes to brokers of up to $10,000 (£7,850) to help them exit the territory through Egypt, according to a Guardian investigation.
Very few Palestinians have been able to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing but those trying to get their names on the list of people permitted to exit daily say they are being asked to pay large “coordination fees” by a network of brokers and couriers with alleged links to the Egyptian intelligence services.
One Palestinian man in the US said he paid $9,000 three weeks ago to get his wife and children on the list. The family have been sheltering in schools since the 7 October attacks. On the day of travel, he was told his children’s names were not listed and he would have to pay an extra $3,000. He said the brokers were “trying to trade in the blood of Gazans”.
“It’s very frustrating and saddening,” he said. “They are trying to exploit people who are suffering, who are trying to get out of the hell in Gaza.” His family have yet to leave.
According to the UN, 85% of Gaza’s population is now displaced. Most people are packed into the southern city of Rafah as Israeli air and ground assaults push them out of central and northern parts of the territory.
Egypt, a key regional player in negotiations on Gaza, has long resisted opening the Rafah crossing, fearing that millions of people would flee into the neighbouring Sinai peninsula. The influx, Cairo claimed, could pose a security threat. Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, also said a mass influx of refugees from Gaza would set a precedent for displacing Palestinians from the West Bank into Jordan.
A network of brokers, based in Cairo, helping Palestinians leave Gaza has operated around the Rafah border for years. But prices have surged since the start of the war, from $500 for each person.
The Guardian has spoken to a number of people who have been told they would have to pay between $5,000 and $10,000 each to leave the strip, with some launching crowdfunding campaigns to raise the money. Others were told they could leave sooner if they paid more.
Facebook pages that offer news from the Rafah crossing are filled with posts from Palestinians asking for help to get on the list.
Everyone interviewed said they had been put in touch with brokers through contacts in Gaza. Payments are made in cash, sometimes through middlemen based in Europe and the US.
Belal, a US citizen from Gaza, was told he would need to raise $85,000 to get 11 family members out of the territory, including five children under three.
“I’m only considering this option because the US government is not responding to me. If I had any hope about my father’s case, I wouldn’t be,” said Belal, who has spent the past three months appealing to the US state department taskforce to put his diabetic father on the exit list.
“I’m in this situation because the US doesn’t want to help its own citizens,” he said.
Belal’s 70-year-old father was briefly detained in December by Israeli forces. He was one of a group of men who were stripped to their underwear, had their hands zip-tied and were taken to a secret location.
Even before his father’s detention, Belal had spent weeks seeking help, spending hours on the phone to Washington or the US embassy in Jerusalem and emailing reams of information to the state department.
US state department policy initially specified that it would only assist immediate family of US citizens to exit Gaza but it subsequently said it would expand its assistance to include parents of US citizens and siblings.
“Since mid-December I’ve received no email from them, and I followed up six times – they can only communicate by email,” he said. “By contrast, I see other people who pay money to leave, and they’re able to exit within a day or two.”
The state department said it was unable to comment on individual cases, with a spokesperson adding it was unaware of the broker system that some are using to pay to exit Gaza. “We have assisted over 1,300 US citizens, US lawful permanent residents and family members in departing Gaza,” the spokesperson added.
Mohannad Sabry, an expert on the Sinai peninsula and author of Sinai: Egypt’s Linchpin, Gaza’s Lifeline, Israel’s Nightmare, said the brokers “target the most vulnerable people”.
“If a family has a member who is injured or sick so they can’t wait, those are the perfect victims; they can squeeze any amount and the family has to come up with the money. It’s a complete racket.”

Sabry described the Egyptian authorities’ public justifications for not opening the borders as “cover for the corruption happening on the ground”. The head of Egypt’s State Information Service declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.
Sabry added: “This is not low-level corruption – this is state-enabled corruption.”
With very few ways to get out of Gaza, especially for those without citizenship of another country, Palestinians in the territory and their relatives abroad said they had little choice but to put their trust in the broker network.
One Palestinian living in the UK, who has lost members of their family in Israeli airstrikes, said: “People are making money off the misery of others. They’re desperate to get out to save their lives and instead of helping they’re trying to make money. If there’s a way to get people out, then why not just help?”
The Palestinian said they were told it would cost $4,000 to help each of the family’s nine young male members to leave in early December. They are now being quoted between $6,000 and $10,000.
The family turned to the brokers after failing to get help from the British government or humanitarian organisations.
“I’m not sure why no schemes have been introduced, nothing to evacuate people. I don’t even hear humanitarians talk about this any more,” the Palestinian said.
“It’s like they’re saying: ‘We’re not going to protect you or give you safety, we’re just going to give you some food and water while you are bombed.’”
The UK Foreign Office said it had evacuated 300 British nationals and their dependants – defined as children and parents – who were its priority.
Not all people are willing to pay, however, even if they have the resources. “Every moment threatens their lives and my life,” said one Palestinian in Gaza trying to get out with their family. But they added: “I won’t pay a penny in bribes.”

The climate costs of war and militaries can no longer be ignored | Doug Weir,2024-01-09,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/09/emission-from-war-military-gaza-ukraine-climate-change,"More than 5% of global emissions are linked to conflict or militaries but countries continue to hide the true scale
Emissions from Israel’s war in Gaza have ‘immense’ effect on climate catastrophe
In early 2022, journalists began to ask us how Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was affecting the climate crisis. While we could point to landscape fires, burning oil refineries and the thirst of diesel-hungry military vehicles, the emissions data they sought just wasn’t available. When it came to the reverberating consequences of Russia’s manipulation of Europe’s fossil fuel insecurity, or to the weakening of the international cooperation necessary for coordinated global climate action, our guesses were no better than theirs.
Two decades of international analysis and debate over the relationship between climate change and security has focused on how our rapidly destabilising climate could undermine the security of states. But it has largely ignored how national security choices, such as military spending or warfighting, can have an impact on the climate, and so undermine our collective security.
With climate breakdown under way and accelerating, it is imperative that we are able to understand and minimise the emissions from all societal activities, whether in peacetime or at war. But when it comes to military or conflict emissions, this remains a distant goal.
Russia’s war in Ukraine has seen the first attempt to comprehensively document the emissions from any conflict, and researchers have had to develop their methodologies from scratch. Their latest estimate puts the total as equivalent to the annual emissions of a country like Belgium. Ukraine is not a one-off, with a similar clamour for emissions data around Israel’s war against Hamas. While the devastating ongoing conflicts in Sudan or Myanmar are yet to see attention on their emissions, the trend is clear: the carbon cost of conflict needs to be understood, just as the humanitarian, economic or wider environmental costs do.
A proportion of those carbon costs come from military activities. For these, understanding is hampered by the longstanding culture of domestic environmental exceptionalism enjoyed by militaries, and how at the US’s insistence, this was translated into UN climate agreements. An exclusion to the 1997 Kyoto protocol became voluntary reporting under the 2015 Paris agreement. But when we began to collate and publish the emissions data that militaries report to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), we found that only a handful of countries publish even the bare minimum required by UN reporting guidelines. Many countries with large militaries publish nothing at all.
The best estimate we have is that militaries are responsible for 5.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. If the global military were a country, this would place it fourth in terms of its emissions, between India and Russia. Militaries are highly fossil fuel dependent and, while net zero targets have opened up debates around military decarbonisation, effective decarbonisation is impossible without understanding the scale of emissions, and without the domestic and international policy frameworks to encourage it. At present, we have neither, while carbon-intensive global military spending has reached record levels.
Ultimately, the international policy framework means the UNFCCC. While some militaries have set vague emissions reduction goals, they are often short on scope and detail, and on accountability. For example, while Nato has drafted a methodology for counting emissions, it does not apply to its members, and it explicitly excludes emissions from Nato-led operations and missions, training and exercises.
Amplified by the ongoing destruction of Gaza, Cop28 saw unprecedented attention on the relationship between the climate crisis, peace and security. But while visible in side events and protests, military and conflict emissions were again absent from the formal agenda. Closing this military and conflict emissions gap will first require that governments acknowledge the outsize role that militaries play in global emissions, and the need for greater transparency. It will require that the climate movement build on the growing trend towards intersectionality in its advocacy, and not shy away from these subjects. And it will depend on expanding the community of researchers documenting military and conflict emissions, and on their data being used by organisations tracking and reporting on global emissions trends.
For decades military environmental exceptionalism and narrow interpretations of climate security have undermined our collective climate security, this has got to change.
Doug Weir is the director of the Conflict and Environment Observatory, a UK charity that studies the environmental dimensions of armed conflicts and military activities. Its Military Emissions Gap project is a collaboration between academic and NGO partners and aims to improve implementation of the Paris agreement through greater military emissions reporting.

"Médecins Sans Frontières says strike on Gaza shelter killed staffer’s daughter, 5 – as it happened",2024-01-09,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/09/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-hamas-israel-gaza-palestine-war-us-antony-blinken-tel-aviv-visit,"This blog is now closed. See all our coverage of the Middle East crisis here
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has condemned “in the strongest possible terms” a strike on an MSF shelter in Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip on Monday.
A five-year-old daughter of an MSF staff worker was critically injured by the strike and underwent surgery at a hospital, the medical charity said. She later died of her injuries on Tuesday, it said.
In a statement, MSF said that more than 100 staff and their family members had been sheltering in the building on Monday morning when a shell broke through the wall.
Thomas Lauvin, MSF project coordinator in Gaza, said:
We are outraged and deeply saddened by the death of yet another family member of our MSF staff. This strike on civilians is unacceptable and, once again, goes to show that it doesn’t matter where you are in Gaza, nowhere is safe. The shell did not detonate on impact, otherwise many more of our staff and their families would have most likely been killed.
The charity said it had notified Israeli forces that the shelter was housing MSF staff and their families, and that no evacuation orders were issued before the strike. It added:
While MSF is not able to confirm the origin of the shell, it appears to be similar to those used by Israeli tanks.
Four of MSF’s staff have been killed since the beginning of the war in addition to numerous family members, it said.
It’s 1.45am in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut and we’re about to close this blog. Our live coverage will resume later in the day. A summary of key recent developments is below. All our coverage of the Israel-Gaza war and the broader Middle East crisis can be seen here. Thank you for reading.
The US has defended its veto last month of a UN security council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying the proposal was “disconnected from the situation on the ground”.
The Associated Press reports that a UN general assembly meeting on Tuesday, the Palestinian and Arab delegations were joined by many other countries as they demanded an immediate halt to the fighting – calls that were echoed by a group of anti-war rabbis in the gallery.
US deputy ambassador Robert Wood repeated that Washington was working to secure a “pause” in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of 136 Israeli hostages in Gaza. He said it was “striking” that those urging an end to the conflict had made very few demands of Hamas, whose 7 October attack on southern Israel sparked the war.
The US only got support from Israel. A ceasefire would be “a victory for Hamas … to continue the reign of terror in Gaza”, said Israel’s UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan. He said Israel supported delivering aid to Gaza but accused Hamas of “looting” humanitarian assistance before it got to civilians. He also accused the UN of doing “nothing” to bring the hostages home.
About 36 rabbis from the group Rabbis 4 Ceasefire, which opposes Israel’s ongoing military action, came to the UN as tourists. The majority of them briefly held signs in the empty security council chamber saying “Biden Stop Vetoing Peace”. A small group did the same in the gallery of the general assembly chamber before being hustled out by UN security officers.
Riyad Mansour, the UN Palestinian ambassador, told the assembly his people were “being slaughtered”, with entire families killed, and stressed that “the horrors need to end, and the only way to end them is a ceasefire”.
This is Adam Fulton picking up our live coverage – stay with us for the latest developments
It’s 1am in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
A total of 23,210 Palestinians have been killed and 59,167 have been wounded in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures by the Gaza health ministry on Tuesday. About 126 Palestinians were killed and 241 were wounded in the previous 24 hours, it said.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has dismissed South Africa’s genocide charge against Israel as “meritless”, but said the daily toll of war on civilians in Gaza is “far too high”. At a press conference in Tel Aviv, Blinken urged Israeli leaders to work with moderate Palestinian leaders, saying regional countries would only invest in the reconstruction of Gaza if there is a “pathway to a Palestinian state”. He added that he was “crystal clear” that Palestinians must be able to return to their homes “as soon as conditions allow”.
Intense fighting, shelling and aerial bombardment continued across the south and centre of Gaza as Blinken met top officials in Israel on a regional tour aimed at reaching a consensus on the Palestinian territory’s future and stopping an escalation of the war across the Middle East. US officials said Blinken told Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, that his forces must avoid inflicting further harm on civilians in Gaza. However, there was no sign of any letup in the violence in Gaza as the two men met.
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has condemned “in the strongest possible terms” a strike on an MSF shelter in Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip on Monday. A five-year-old daughter of an MSF staff worker was critically injured by the strike and died of her injuries on Tuesday, it said. The charity said it had notified Israeli forces that the shelter was housing MSF staff and their families.
The leaders of Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, will meet on Wednesday to discuss the war in Gaza and surging violence in the West Bank. Jordan’s King Abdullah II will host a summit with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in the southern Red Sea city of Aqaba, according to a statement issued by Jordan’s royal court.
Israel and Hezbollah edged closer towards full scale war on Tuesday, as the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group launched explosive drones at a key Israeli command base, declaring the attack part of its response to recent high-level Israeli assassinations in Lebanon. Hezbollah announced it had launched “a number of explosive attack drones” at the Israeli northern military command base in Safed, the first time it has targeted the site. An Israeli army spokesperson said there had been no damage or casualties.
Hezbollah has denied a claim by the Israeli military that it killed the southern Lebanon commander of Hezbollah’s aerial unit in an airstrike on Tuesday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had killed Ali Hussein Barji, who it said had led dozens of drone attacks on Israel. But in a statement, Hezbollah said “the commander was never subjected to any assassination attempt as the enemy claimed.”
Israeli aircraft, drones and artillery struck multiple targets inside southern Lebanon, including a strike on a car during the funeral of a senior commander in the group’s elite Radwan force who had been killed the day before. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, said that while his country was open to negotiations, it was being threatened with war.
The Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh has called on Muslim states to provide Palestinian militants with weapons, adding that the group’s war with Israel is “not the battle of the Palestinian people alone”. At a conference in Doha, Haniyeh said Israel had “failed to achieve any of its goals” after nearly 100 days of its war in Gaza, and argued that the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October “came after an attempt to marginalise the Palestinian cause”.
The UK maritime trade operations (UKMTO) said on Tuesday that it received a report of an incident in the Red Sea near Yemen. UKMTO received a report of an incident approximately 50 nautical miles (93 km) west of Yemen’s Hodeidah, which authorities were investigating, it said in an advisory note. A Yemeni military source told Al Jazeera that the Houthis had targeted a ship linked to Israel in the Red Sea.
The former UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will join a South African delegation for this week’s hearings at the international court of justice (ICJ), where the country has accused Israel of genocide in Gaza. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said “there is nothing more atrocious and preposterous” than the lawsuit as he censured South Africa for bringing the case, which is due to begin hearings on Thursday. Belgium’s deputy prime minister, Petra De Sutter, also expressed support for South Africa’s case.
The UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, has admitted he is “worried” that Israel might have taken action in Gaza that might be in breach of international law. Cameron also confirmed to parliament’s foreign affairs committee that two British nationals are still being held hostage in Gaza. Israel needs to “act carefully” and avoid risking further escalation in its war with Hamas, Downing Street said in a separate statement.
The international criminal court (ICC) has confirmed it is investigating potential crimes against journalists since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas. At least 79 journalists and media workers, the vast majority of them Palestinian, have been killed since the war began three months ago, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
UN international law experts have criticised the killing of Hamas deputy leader, Saleh al-Arouri, and other fighters in drone strikes in Lebanon. In a statement, UN special rapporteurs Ben Saul and Morris Tidball-Binz said killings in foreign territory are arbitrary when they are not authorised under international law.
The planet-warming emissions generated during the first two months of the war in Gaza were greater than the annual carbon footprint of more than 20 of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations, new research reveals.
The former UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will join a South African delegation for this week’s hearings at the international court of justice (ICJ), where the country has accused Israel of genocide in Gaza.
South Africa’s justice ministry said Corbyn was one of a number of “senior political figures from progressive political parties and movements across the globe” who will join the South African delegation at The Hague for two days of preliminary hearings which begin on Thursday.
South Africa has accused Israel of genocide in its campaign against Hamas in Gaza, saying among other things that it has the “specific intent … to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”.
In its 84-page filing, it also says Israel has failed to prevent genocide and failed to prosecute officials who have publicly incited genocide.
Corbyn expressed support for South Africa’s case against Israel on Monday and criticised the British government in a social media message.
“Every day, another unspeakable atrocity is committed in Gaza,” he wrote.
Millions of people around the world support South Africa’s efforts to hold Israel to account. Why can’t our government?
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has condemned “in the strongest possible terms” a strike on an MSF shelter in Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip on Monday.
A five-year-old daughter of an MSF staff worker was critically injured by the strike and underwent surgery at a hospital, the medical charity said. She later died of her injuries on Tuesday, it said.

While MSF is not able to confirm the origin of the shell, it appears to be similar to those used by Israeli tanks.
Four of MSF’s staff have been killed since the beginning of the war in addition to numerous family members, it said.
A meeting between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Tel Aviv earlier today was “tense”, according to a report.
The Times of Israel reported, citing a Channel 12 story, that Washington is losing its patience over Tel Aviv’s outlook on its war with Hamas in Gaza.
The outlet noted that the Israeli prime minister’s office did not release a readout of the meeting, as it usually does.
Matthew Miller, a US state department spokesperson, said after the meeting that Blinken had reaffirmed to Netanyahu the US’s support for Israel’s attempts to stop any repeat of the Hamas attack of 7 October but “stressed the importance of avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian infrastructure in Gaza”.
Hezbollah has denied a claim by the Israeli military that it killed the southern Lebanon commander of Hezbollah’s aerial unit, Ali Hussein Barji, in an airstrike on Tuesday.
In a statement, Hezbollah said “the commander was never subjected to any assassination attempt as the enemy claimed.”
Here are some of the latest images we have received over the newswires from the Gaza Strip and Israel.
Belgium’s deputy prime minister, Petra De Sutter, has expressed support for South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.
Posting to social media, De Sutter said she wants Belgium to take action at the international court of justice (ICJ), following the lead of South Africa. She wrote:
Belgium cannot stand by and watch the immense human suffering in Gaza. We must act against the threat of genocide.
Belgium cannot stand by and watch the immense human suffering in Gaza. We must act against the threat of genocide.I want Belgium to take action at the International Court of Justice, following the lead of South Africa.I will propose this within the Belgian government. #begov
South Africa has launched a case against Israel at the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) accusing the state of committing genocide in its military campaign in Gaza. Israel has responded to the allegations “with disgust”, calling South Africa’s case a “blood libel” and urging the ICJ to reject it.
A Palestinian journalist has said he was subjected to beatings and torture during more than a month of detention by Israeli forces.
Diaa al-Kahlout, the Gaza bureau chief of the London-based media outlet The New Arab, was arrested by the Israeli army in Beit Lahia city in north Gaza on 7 December and detained without charge for several weeks, the outlet said.
He was among dozens of Palestinians shown detained by Israeli troops and stripped to their underwear last month, the Qatari-owned outlet said.
In an interview, Kahlout described the Israeli army’s treatment of himself and other detained Palestinians as “indescribably tough and difficult”. He said:
The moment I was detained, Israeli soldiers crowded round me and I heard the word “journalist” said more than once, before they gagged me with tape so I couldn’t speak. They were mocking journalists and their work.
He said he was subjected to beatings and torture several times by agents of Israel’s internal security agency, Shin Bet. He said he spent 25 out of the 33 days of his detention forced to remain in a kneeling position, which caused him severe pain.
We reported earlier that the UK maritime trade operations (UKMTO) said it received a report of an incident in the Red Sea near Yemen.
A Yemeni military source has told Al Jazeera that the Houthis had targeted a ship linked to Israel in the Red Sea.
Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have stepped up attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea in protest against Israel’s war in Gaza.
The leaders of Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, will meet tomorrow to discuss the war in Gaza and surging violence in the West Bank.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II will host a summit with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Wednesday in the southern Red Sea city of Aqaba, according to a statement issued by Jordan’s royal court.
The leaders will discuss the “serious developments” in the Gaza Strip as well as “the situation in the West Bank”, it said.
The meeting will be held as part of “Jordan’s efforts to coordinate Arab positions to push for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and ensure the uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid”, it said.
The UK maritime trade operations (UKMTO) said it received a report of an incident in the Red Sea near Yemen.
In a social media post, it said it received a report of an incident in the Red Sea approximately 50 nautical miles west of Al Hodeidah. Authorities were investigating, it added.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has killed the southern Lebanon commander of Hezbollah’s aerial unit, Ali Hussein Barji, in an airstrike on Tuesday.
IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the Hezbollah commander had led dozens of drone attacks on Israel.
The IDF statement came after reports that an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon had killed a top Hezbollah commander.
It’s just past 10pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
A total of 23,210 Palestinians have been killed and 59,167 have been wounded in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures by the Gaza health ministry on Tuesday. About 126 Palestinians were killed and 241 were wounded in the previous 24 hours, it said.

US officials said Blinken told Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, that his forces must avoid inflicting further harm on civilians in Gaza. However, there was no sign of any letup in the violence in Gaza as the two men met.
Israel’s military has said it has expanded its ground operation in the city of Khan Younis inside the Gaza Strip. The IDF claimed on Tuesday that “dozens of terrorists were killed” and “large quantities of weapons and underground terror tunnel shafts were located”. The claims have not been independently verified. Israel has said that 182 of its soldiers have so far been killed during fighting inside the Gaza Strip.
Israel and Hezbollah edged closer towards full scale war on Tuesday, as the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group launched explosive drones at a key Israeli command base, declaring the attack part of its response to recent high-level Israeli assassinations in Lebanon. Hezbollah announced it had launched “a number of explosive attack drones” at the Israeli northern military command base in Safed, the first time it has targeted the site.

Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said “there is nothing more atrocious and preposterous” than the lawsuit filed in the international court of justice (ICJ) accusing Israel of genocidal actions against Palestinians in the Gaza war. Herzog censured South Africa for bringing the case, which is due to begin hearings on Thursday. Herzog added Israel must win “because it is a war that affects international values and the values of the free world”.
The UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, has admitted he is “worried” that Israel might have taken action in Gaza that might be in breach of international law. Cameron also confirmed to parliament’s foreign affairs committee that two British nationals are still being held hostage in Gaza. Israel needs to “act carefully” and avoid risking further escalation in its war with Hamas, Downing Street has said.
Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has said the international community has an obligation to organise security in Gaza after the war and a reformed Palestinian Authority must play a crucial role in its future. Egypt and Germany both “agree that Gaza and the West Bank belong to Palestinians”, she told reporters in Cairo on Tuesday. Baerbock also visited the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt as part of her Middle East trip.
The international criminal court (ICC) has confirmed it is investigating potential crimes against journalists since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas. At least 79 journalists and media workers, the vast majority of them Palestinian, have been killed since the war began three months ago, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
The Israel Defense Forces said they shot dead a Palestinian man on Tuesday following an alleged stabbing attack near the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Israeli forces have killed more than 330 Palestinians in the West Bank since the war between Israel and Hamas began three months ago, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) has accused Israel of a “brutal crime” after footage circulating on social media appeared to show a military vehicle running over a dead militant in the occupied West Bank.
UN international law experts have criticised the killing of Hamas deputy leader, Saleh al-Arouri, and other fighters in drone strikes in Lebanon. In a statement, UN special rapporteurs Ben Saul and Morris Tidball-Binz said killings in foreign territory are arbitrary when they are not authorised under international law.
The planet-warming emissions generated during the first two months of the war in Gaza were greater than the annual carbon footprint of more than 20 of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations, new research reveals.
The commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, is posting on social media a fresh message that Gaza “is simply becoming uninhabitable” under Israeli bombardment in response to the murderous attacks by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October.
The relief agency has used its latest post on X, formerly known as Twitter, to call for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire”, saying such action “is a matter of life and death”.
UNRWA points out list the latest stage of the crisis in Gaza thus: “Almost an entire population forcibly displaced; Families search for safety where there is none; Health system rapidly collapsing; Famine looms; Unprecedented levels of depravation; People driven to despair.”

The UN security council has voted to approve a resolution drafted by the US and Japan to demand an end to attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels. The council voted down proposed amendments from Russia that would have weakened the resolution. The vote passed with 11 votes in favour, zero objections and four abstentions, including Russia, China and Algeria.
The head of Yemen’s Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, has reacted to the UN resolution on navigation in the Red Sea. Al-Houthi said in a post on X that what Yemeni armed forces were doing comes within the framework of legitimate defence, and that any action they face will have a reaction. He also described the resolution as a “political game”. “We call on the Security Council to immediately release 2.3 Million people from the Israeli-American siege in Gaza,” he said.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has condemned attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea as “reckless and dangerous” during a meeting with Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa in Manama, the penultimate stop of the diplomat’s whistle stop Middle East tour. Earlier on Wednesday he met the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, in the West Bank, where they discussed “ongoing efforts to minimise civilian harm in Gaza, accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid, end extremist violence, and work towards an independent Palestinian state”.
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has posted on X his views about the future of Gaza. He says “I want to make a few points absolutely clear: Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population. Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists, not the Palestinian population, and we are doing so in full compliance with international law.” The comments come as the international court of justice case against Israel is set to get under way on Thursday.
Pramila Patten, the United Nations special representative on sexual violence, will visit Israel this month to look at allegations of rape and other sexual offences committed by Hamas fighters on and after 7 October. Patten has been granted investigative authority by Israel’s foreign ministry that will allow her to speak with survivors and released Israeli hostages who were raped or sexually assaulted. Her office portrayed the visit as an “information gathering mission”.
The Israeli Defense Forces chief of staff said no village in Lebanon was out of the military’s reach, after an escalation in violence between Israeli forces and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group based there. Herzi Halevi told a gathering of soldiers in Gaza that their actions in the besieged Palestinian territory had convinced him that they could take the fight into Lebanese territory if needed, AFP reported.
The World Health Organization (WHO) director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said there were nearly “insurmountable obstacles” to delivering humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, saying the situation was “indescribable”. He said six planned missions to northern Gaza had been cancelled because Israel had rejected requests and not given assurances of safe passage, adding that a mission planned for today also had to be cancelled.
Britain warned of severe consequences after US and UK warships were forced to repel a barrage of 20 Houthi rockets, drones and cruise missiles fired at ships in the Red Sea. American and British forces say they shot down 18 drones and three missiles on Tuesday. The Italian defense minister, Guido Crosetto, has said that Yemen’s Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping must be stopped without triggering a new war.
A total of 23,357 Palestinians have been killed and 59,410 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said. The ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 147 Palestinians were killed and 243 injured in the past 24 hours. About 1.9 million people, or nearly 85% of the total population of Gaza, are estimated to have been displaced from their homes. Only 15 out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are partially functional. Three hundred and thirty Palestinians have also been killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank over the same period, including 84 children, and nearly 4,000 people have been injured by Israeli security forces during that time.
The IDF announced the death of another member of Israel’s troops inside Gaza, taking the total toll of the ground offensive to 186. The Israeli military has said that 1,065 of its soldiers have been injured in Gaza. Israel launched its military campaign after the 7 October surprise Hamas attack during which about 1,200 people were killed. An estimated 240 people were seized as hostages. About 130 are still believed to be in captivity. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty counts being issued during the conflict.
Israel’s military claims to have “uncovered more than 15 underground tunnel shafts in the area” of Maghazi in central Gaza, where it says that its troops directed airstrikes that killed “several terrorists”. In Khan Younis, it claims that “in battles in the area over the last day, dozens of terrorist operatives were killed by IDF troops”, adding that “a total of approximately 150 terror targets were struck by IDF troops over the last day”. The claims have not been independently verified.
Israel’s military has also said that it is has again struck at what it described as Hezbollah terrorist targets inside southern Lebanon.
The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported Israel detained a further 26 Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It brings the total number of detainees since 7 October to more than 5,780.
Israeli politician Nissim Vaturi reiterated his call for Gaza to be burned down, saying “there are no innocents there”. Referring to Palestinians still in northern Gaza after repeated orders from the Israeli military for them to flee, Vaturi said: “One hundred thousand remain. I have no mercy for those who are still there. We need to eliminate them.” The comments came ahead of a hearing on Thursday at the international court of justice, where South Africa has accused Israel of genocide in Gaza.
Here’s our full report on that UN resolution that has passed in the last few hours:
The UN security council has called for an immediate end to attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping in the Red Sea, adopting a resolution despite abstentions from Russia and China.
The resolution also called on the Houthis to release the Galaxy Leader, a Japanese-operated vehicle carrier linked to an Israeli businessman that the group commandeered on 19 November, along with its 25 crew.
US Central Command said there have been 26 Houthi strikes on shipping since then, causing shipping companies to bypass the route and instead divert around South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, significantly adding to journey times and cost.

Here are some of the latest images coming out of the US secretary of state’s meeting the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, and with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday.
The United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (Ocha) has posted its latest update on the Israel-Gaza war.
In their wide-ranging report they note the difficulty of delivering aid to Gaza:
Between 1 and 10 January, only 14 per cent (3 of 21) planned aid deliveries of food, medicines, water, and other lifesaving supplies to the north of Wadi Gaza proceeded.
Humanitarian partners were forced to cancel or delay missions in two instances due to excessive delays at Israeli checkpoints or because the agreed routes were unpassable.
Humanitarian partners’ ability to respond to extensive needs in the northern side of Gaza is being curtailed by recurring denials of access for aid delivers and lack of coordinated safe access by the Israeli authorities.
These denials and severe access constraints paralyze the ability of humanitarian partners to respond meaningfully, consistently and at-scale.
Martin Griffiths, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, has posted on X some reaction to the deaths of four employees with the Palestine Red Crescent’s ambulance crew.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society has alleged in a statement that they were killed after Israel targeted an ambulance in the city of Deir al-Balah in Gaza.
Griffiths says “The rules of war are clear: Parties must protect civilians, including humanitarian workers. These rules must be upheld.”
Such devastating news. We mourn the loss of these brave colleagues. The rules of war are clear: Parties must protect civilians, including humanitarian workers.These rules must be upheld.The fighting must end. https://t.co/MLtZSFHJBb
The head of Yemen’s Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, has reacted to the UN resolution on navigation in the Red Sea.
The UN security council on Wednesday demanded Yemen’s Houthis immediately end attacks on ships in the Red Sea and implicitly endorsed a US-led taskforce that has been defending vessels while cautioning against escalating tensions.
Al-Houthi said in a post on X that what Yemeni armed forces were doing comes within the framework of legitimate defence, and that any action they face will have a reaction. He also described the resolution as a “political game”.
“We call on the Security Council to immediately release 2.3 Million people from the Israeli-American siege in Gaza,” he said.
نطالب بأن يكف الكيان الإسرائيلي فورا عن جميع الهجمات التي تعيق الحياة واستمرارها في غزة وتقوض الحقوق والحريات والسلم والأمن الإقليميين. كما نطالب مجلس الامن بالإفراج فورا عن مليونين وثلاثمائة انسان من الحصار الإسرائيلي الامريكي الذي بات سلاحا قاتل وباتت غزة بسببه تمثل أكبر سجن…
The Israeli military says it has found evidence that hostages were present in an underground tunnel in Gaza.
Associated Press reports that the military showed the tunnel to journalists who were escorted into a neighbourhood near the ruins of destroyed homes and streets. It reports:
A corrugated tin hut covered the tunnel’s entrance in a residential yard.
A makeshift ladder led to the narrow underground pathway, about 2.5 meters (8 feet) below. The tunnel was hot and humid, with walls lined with concrete and electrical wires. Farther inside was a bathroom, where the military said it found evidence that hostages had been there, including their DNA.
“Hostages were held here in this tunnel system,” said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the army’s chief spokesperson.
Hagari offered no details on what exactly was found in the tunnel, nor did he say when the hostages were there or identify them. He did not say if they were known to be dead or alive.
In a later statement to the media, he said the captives were held in “difficult conditions,” without elaborating.
International journalists have struggled to get into Gaza unless they embed with the Israeli military.
Some more analysis of the UN security council vote is coming through.
The key provision of the resolution, sponsored by the US and Japan, noted the right of UN member states, in accordance with international law, “to defend their vessels from attack, including those that undermine navigational rights and freedoms.”
Reuters is reporting that the provision amounted to an implicit endorsement of Operation Prosperity Guardian, a US-led multinational naval taskforce that has been defending commercial ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden from Houthi missile and drone attacks.
The Houthis, a group that seized much of Yemen in a civil war, have vowed to attack ships linked to Israel or bound for Israeli ports to show support for Hamas battling the Israeli offensive in Gaza. However, many of the targeted ships have had no links to Israel.
The council voted after rejecting amendments proposed by Russia that would have stripped out the implicit endorsement of the US-led taskforce and included the war in Gaza among the “root causes” of the Houthi strikes, says Reuters.
Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia questioned the legitimacy of the taskforce and said the resolution as drafted was “an open-ended blessing of it.”
The Houthi attacks have disrupted maritime commerce, prompting some shipping lines to divert vessels from the Red Sea to longer routes, threatening to increase energy and food prices.
In the latest strikes, Washington said US and British warships on Tuesday shot down 21 drones and missiles fired by the Houthis at southern Red Sea shipping lanes in what London called the largest such attack in the area.
Let’s get more on the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and his meeting with the Palestinian Authority (PA) president, Mahmoud Abbas.
Blinken pressed Abbas to reform his government, the Associated Press reports.
In their meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Blinken told Abbas that the US supports “tangible steps” toward a Palestinian state, according to state department spokesperson Matthew Miller.
Blinken said later that they discussed reforming the Palestinian Authority so “it can effectively take responsibility for Gaza”. Abbas appeared ready to “engage in all of these efforts”, Blinken said at his next stop, the Bahraini capital of Manama.
Abbas spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh said they heard “good statements” from the Americans. “But nothing has happened,” he said. “The priority now is to stop the war on Gaza.”
Reuters is reporting some initial reaction from the Houthis to the UN security council vote.
The security council has voted to approve a resolution drafted by the US and Japan to demand an end to attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels.
The Houthi spokesperson in Yemen, Mohammed Abdul Salam, has described the resolution as a “political game”.
The spokesperson has accused the US of violating international law, instead.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has posted on X a thread which includes his views about the future of Gaza.
He says:

It’s 1:08am on Thursday in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut. Here’s where things stand in the Middle East crisis:
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has condemned attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea as “reckless and dangerous” during a meeting with Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa in Manama, the penultimate stop of the diplomat’s whistle stop Middle East tour.

He said six planned missions to northern Gaza had been cancelled because Israel had rejected requests and not given assurances of safe passage, adding that a mission planned for today also had to be cancelled.
The British defense secretary, Grant Shapps, hinted there could be further western military action against the Houthis in Yemen, telling reporters to “watch this space” when asked about possible further action after last night’s drone attack in the Red Sea.
Britain warned of severe consequences after US and UK warships were forced to repel a barrage of 20 Houthi rockets, drones and cruise missiles fired at ships in the Red Sea.

We need to eliminate them.” The comments came ahead of a hearing on Thursday at the international court of justice, where South Africa has accused Israel of genocide in Gaza.
Barbara Woodward, the UK ambassador to the UN, welcomed the passing of the resolution. She said:
The UK condemns in the strongest terms the illegal and unjustified attacks in the Red Sea by Houthi militants. Yesterday, the Houthis attempted their largest attack yet, launching at least 21 missiles and drones towards international shipping lanes.
Fifteen percent of all global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea. These attacks threatened to spike the availability and prices of food and energy, which would inevitably hit the world’s poorest, the hardest. Yesterday’s was the 26th such attack since the 19th of November.
This was despite the council’s demand on the first of December for the Houthis to stop all such attacks immediately. On 3 January, the UK joined 11 countries in a statement warning against further attacks.
So we’re using all diplomatic means possible to deter these attacks. And that is why we voted in favor of this resolution.
Here are details of the resolution just passed by the UN security council demanding an end to attacks on Red Sea shipping, courtesy of the independent security council report.
It says language specifically referencing Gaza that Algeria and Russia apparently proposed was not accommodated, and the draft resolution was updated to emphasize the need to address “the root causes, including the conflicts contributing to regional tensions and the disruption of maritime security”.
Russia and Algeria were two of the abstentions in the security council vote.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has told King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain that Houthi attacks in the Red Sea are “reckless and dangerous” during the latest stopover on the senior diplomat’s whistle-stop tour of the Middle East.
The two met in Manama on Wednesday evening, where they discussed the attacks on commercial shipping and “reaffirmed their shared commitment to international law and freedom of navigation”, according to a state department readout.
Blinken expanded on the issue in comments during a press availability following the meeting:
We know all about the hostages in Gaza; well, the Houthis have taken more than 25 hostages from the ships that they’ve seized since this fall. So all of this has required us – this challenge, this threat to the interests of countries around the world, has required us to respond.
We put together Operation Prosperity Guardian with more than 20 countries, including Bahrain, to do everything we can to preserve freedom of navigation, freedom of shipping in the Red Sea.
A UN security vote was expected later on Wednesday on a US-drafted resolution demanding an end to the Red Sea attacks. As of 5pm ET, there was no indication of what time the vote might take place.
Earlier on Wednesday, Blinken met the Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank, where he restated the US commitment to a Palestinian state.
Blinken will wrap up his trip in Egypt on Thursday. He visited Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Israel and the West Bank before his penultimate stopover in Bahrain.
Read our earlier report on Blinken’s travels by the Guardian’s Jason Burke and Sufian Taha:
Two videos from the West Bank showing Israeli troops shooting a 17-year-old boy and security forces repeatedly running over the body of a man they had shot have added to concerns about the Israeli military’s rules of engagement, the Guardian’s Emma Graham-Harrison reports from Jerusalem.
The shooting of 17-year-old Osaid Rimawi in the early hours of last Friday is shown in footage from a security camera in a local shop that was obtained by the Associated Press news agency. The video also shows two earlier rounds of gunfire that injured two unarmed men. Rimawi was killed when he tried to rush to their aid.
The only weapons visible in the footage are guns held by Israeli soldiers. Soldiers gathered round the dead and injured bodies; one prodded Rimawi with his foot, then drove away. They did not make any arrests.
The Israeli military said troops in Beit Rima had opened fire on suspects who had thrown explosives and firebombs, AP reported. Local residents said the killings were unprovoked, and no one had thrown explosives.
The Israeli military has repeatedly been accused of using deadly violence without provocation. Most of the victims have been Palestinians, but they include three Israeli hostages, who were killed after they escaped Hamas captivity in December. They were bare-chested, waving white flags and at least one was shouting in Hebrew.
Earlier this week, footage from Gaza emerged that appeared to show a sniper killing a woman as she led a column of civilians trying to reach a safe zone in November. She was waving a white flag and walking beside a young child.
Read the full story here:
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has posted to Twitter/X a powerful video message urging Israel to allow it to deliver humanitarian aid in Gaza.
“Delivering humanitarian aid in Gaza continues to face nearly insurmountable challenges. We have the supplies, the teams and the plans in place. What we don’t have is access,” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said in the message posted Wednesday afternoon.
“We call on Israel to approve requests by WHO and other partners to deliver humanitarian aid.”

Albanese government refuses to reveal stance on UN genocide case against Israel,2024-01-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/11/albanese-government-refuses-to-reveal-stance-on-un-genocide-case-against-israel,"Dfat vows to ‘convey concerns’ over inflammatory remarks from Israeli officials but does not commit to backing South Africa’s case in the international court of justice
The Albanese government is refusing to reveal its position on South Africa’s case against Israel at the UN’s international court of justice before the court’s first hearing into allegations of genocide on Thursday at The Hague.
The foreign affairs department has, however, vowed to call out any inflammatory comments made by Israeli officials, as outlined in South Africa’s claim, adding that it has conveyed “concern about such remarks on several occasions”.
The case brought by South Africa at the beginning of the year will be heard on 11 and 12 January, with the potential for a provisional ruling within weeks. It accuses Israel of committing genocide, and having genocidal intent, in Gaza. Israel has called the allegations “a despicable and contemptuous exploitation” of the ICJ and urged the court to reject it.

While the Australian government has previously thrown its support behind the Ukrainian government in its case against Russia at the ICJ shortly after Moscow’s invasion, the government is keeping its cards close in South Africa’s case against Israel.
The Department of Foreign affairs and Trade (Dfat) declined to respond to questions by Guardian Australia about whether it had exercised its responsibility to the genocide convention – of which Australia is a signatory – in relation to the Israel-Gaza conflict and what its position on South Africa’s ICJ claim is.
A provisional ruling in favour of South Africa against Israel would require the Netanyahu government to reconsider its military operation in Gaza, which has killed more than 22,000 Palestinians since 7 October, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
Measures could include the immediate suspension of Israel’s operations in Gaza and the lifting of a blockade to allow humanitarian assistance and aid into the strip.
If such a ruling were made, Australia, and other OECD countries yet to reveal their position, would have to decide whether to accept the international court’s ruling, which arbitrates matters in line with the global rules-based order.
Only a handful of countries, including Malaysia, Turkey and Bolivia, have so far offered their support for South Africa’s case.
The US has spoken out against the claim, with the national security council spokesperson John Kirby describing it as “meritless, counterproductive, and completely without any basis in fact whatsoever”.
South Africa’s application accuses Israel’s acts and omissions in relation to Gaza as being “genocidal in character”, citing public comments made by top Israeli officials.
One example highlighted in the 84-page application is the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant’s reference to Palestinians in Gaza as “human animals”.
Another example referenced are comments made by Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, who said on 12 October it was “an entire nation out there that is responsible”, in reference to those in Gaza, and that Israel “will fight until we break their backbone”.
When asked whether the federal government had seen the comments detailed in the claim, a Dfat spokesperson said it had conveyed its concern to Israeli officials.

“Australia is concerned at remarks by any party that are provocative or inflame tensions,” the spokesperson said. “We have conveyed to Israeli counterparts our concern about such remarks on several occasions in the past and will continue to do so.
“While Australia has reaffirmed Israel’s right to defend itself, we have said consistently that the way it does so matters. We regularly press Israel on the need to respect international law and protect civilian lives.”
The opposition’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, told Guardian Australia on Friday that the Albanese government should rule out its support for South Africa’s “unbalanced” case.
“No country could live with the threat posed by Hamas to innocent civilians, which must be removed for both Israelis and Palestinians to have any hope of living peacefully alongside one another,” he said.
Independent ACT senator David Pocock has supported South Africa’s case, saying on Thursday he was “strongly supportive of the need for a credible and robust examination of Israel’s conduct under the Genocide Convention”.
A number of advocates in Australia are also urging the Albanese government to intervene and support the case.
Rawan Arraf, the head of the Australian Centre for International Justice, an independent not-for-profit legal centre, called on the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, and the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, to back the ICJ application in a letter on Tuesday.
The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network also announced that its national campaign pushing the Australian government to support the case had attracted almost 22,000 supporters in just two days.

Queensland road repairs on skids as rain and possible cyclone loom
Heavy rain has sparked fears far north Queensland roads hit by giant landslides may collapse as the region braces for more wild weather, AAP reports.
Work has begun to clear debris strewn across the Douglas Shire’s Cape Tribulation Road network north of Cairns, including a giant 56-metre landslide.
The area was one of the worst hit after ex-Tropical Cyclone Jasper caused record flooding just weeks ago.
But road work may be jeopardised by heavy rain with a tropical low – and possibly another cyclone – set to form in the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Douglas Shire mayor Michael Kerr said:
We have extensive landslides. We need extra crews to assist. This work needs to be done quite quickly because there is a lot of weight on the roads. The longer it is there the more chance there is of collapse.
More than 20 Kayakers for Palestine this morning formed a blockade line to prevent the departure of an Israeli cargo ship.
The ZIM Danube container ship was set to depart the Port of Melbourne today and is now surrounded by kayakers who have spray-painted “stop the genocide” on the side of the ZIM ship.
The blockade comes as the UN’s international court of justice prepares to hear South Africa’s case accusing the Netanyahu government of genocide, and having genocidal intent, in Gaza.
Israel has called the allegations “a despicable and contemptuous exploitation” of the ICJ and urged the court to reject it.
WA warned to prepare for heatwave conditions

In the Pilbara, Marble Bar will be hot, with 44C forecast for Friday and 46C on Saturday and Sunday.
A low-intensity heatwave is expected in Perth, with top temperatures of 37C on Friday, 39C on Saturday and 37C on Sunday.
Hot conditions are also expected in much of the state’s south-west, with Busselton tipped to reach highs of 38C on Saturday and Sunday.

Showers and gusty thunderstorms are likely in the Kimberley, through to Sunday.
An extreme heatwave is also predicted for parts of the Goldfields, with temperatures in Kalgoorlie expected to climb to 37C on Saturday, 38C on Sunday and 40C on Monday, when rain is also forecast.
For my fellow sufferers of frizzy hair in Sydney at the moment, the dew point – rather than humidity – might be to blame, with the city recording its highest on record.
According to Weatherzone meteorologist, Ben Domensino, Sydney registered its highest dew point on record, based on hourly observations, after reaching 25.9C at 11am.
What is a dew point you may ask? According to the Bureau of Meteorology:
Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled in order to produce condensation (dew). It represents how much moisture is in the air: the higher the dew point temperature, the greater the atmospheric moisture content.
#BREAKING - #Sydney has today registered its highest dew point on record, based on hourly observations, after reaching 25.9ºC at 11am. Sub-hourly dew points have gone as high as 26.7ºC so far, although these can't be compared to historical data. Phenomenal obs for Sydney. https://t.co/jqVunTG8mL
St Vincent’s said it shared the frustrations of patients and other affected people, but that its work to investigate the incident continued. Today’s statement continued:
We know that our staff, patients, residents, partners and the public want to know the status of the investigation. They particularly want to understand what, if any, sensitive personal information has been stolen by the cyber criminals.
We recognise that it may be frustrating and difficult to hear that this work is ongoing and that answers are not yet clear. We also feel that frustration.
The hospital says it has no evidence that any kind of sensitive personal information has been stolen, but that it would “activate a comprehensive response plan and offer support services to those affected” if that situation changes.
We have established a dedicated support line – 1300 124 507 – and email address – stvincentscybersafety@svha.org.au – for anyone who wants to contact us.
St Vincent’s hospital says it still believes no personal information of patients was stolen during the cyber breach they reported in December, but has staff monitoring the dark web for any data being shared online.
The hospital reported “suspicious activity on our network” on 19 December, notifying state and federal regulators of the incident. But the health provider said in a statement today that “since the morning of Wednesday, 20 December we have not detected any activity by the cyber criminals”.
It said:
At this stage of the investigation, there has been no evidence that the stolen data contains any sensitive personal information.
Our monitoring activities have not detected evidence of any stolen data being posted on the dark web. We have also been undertaking necessary system response and remediation activities.
Thanks Mostafa, good afternoon from a very humid Sydney!
And with that I leave the blog with Natasha May. Thanks for reading.
Forrest’s Squadron Energy commits to 14GW of ‘green electricity’
Billionaire Andrew Forrest has today committed to developing a pipeline of renewable energy projects with a total capacity of 14 gigawatts. (Australia’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, is about 2.8GW.)
No dollar sum has been announced, but Forrest’s Squadron Energy has signed a $2.75bn “green strategic alliance” with GE Vernova for wind turbines, so we assume most of the capacity will be in windfarms.
Part of that supply presumably will be tied up in the Uungula Wind Farm, with Squadron announcing work had started on today.
The 69-turbine farm near Wellington within NSW’s Central West-Orana renewable energy zone, will generate (so to speak) 260 jobs and inject $40m into the local economy, the company said.
“The time for talk is over, we are investing right now in Australia’s green energy transition and creating jobs and economic development for regional Australia,” Forrest said.
“No longer will we have to rely on expensive, volatile, planet destroying fuels. We will have secure and inexpensive energy from a huge new industry for Australia.”

Finnish and Icelandic artists call for Israel to be banned from Eurovision,2024-01-11,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/11/finnish-and-icelandic-artists-call-for-israel-to-be-banned-from-eurovision,"More than 1,400 Finland-based artists sign petition for Israel to be excluded from contest over alleged war crimes in Gaza
More than 1,400 Finnish artists have joined Icelandic musicians in demanding that Israel be banned from this year’s Eurovision song contest over alleged war crimes in Gaza.
If Israel is not excluded from the competition, which will be held in the Swedish city of Malmö in May, the Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yle) should boycott the contest and refuse to send a Finnish entry, they say.
“It is not in accordance with our values that a country that commits war crimes and continues a military occupation is given a public stage to polish its image in the name of music,” reads a petition that has been signed by Finland-based artists, musicians and music industry professionals.
“At the same time other participating countries end up giving their support to Israel’s policies.”
Israel launched an assault on Gaza after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and took 250 people hostage on 7 October. The Israeli military has killed at least 23,570 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.
Responding to the calls for a ban, Israel’s ambassador to Sweden, Ziv Nevo Kulman, said: “On 7 October, Israel was brutally attacked by a vicious terrorist organisation that openly calls for its annihilation. Promoting a boycott of Israel is supporting the acts of Hamas, is giving a prize to terrorism and is incompatible with the values of the [Eurovision Broadcasting Union] and of the competition.”
The UN’s international court of justice in The Hague heard opening arguments on Thursday in a case brought by South Africa in which Israel stands accused of acting with “genocidal intent” in Gaza. Israel has denied the allegations, calling them baseless. It will give its response on Friday.
Among the artists who have signed the Finnish petition are Olavi Uusivirta, Paleface and Axel Ehnström, who represented Finland at Eurovision in 2011.
Last month, the Icelandic Association of Composers and Lyricists told its members not to participate in the show unless Israel was banned.
Lukas Korpelainen, one of the authors of the petition, told the newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet it was unacceptable for Israel to take part in Eurovision “to polish its image”.
A Eurovision song contest spokesperson said: “The Eurovision Song Contest is a competition for public service broadcasters from across Europe and the Middle East. It is a competition for broadcasters – not governments – and the Israeli public broadcaster has participated in the contest for 50 years.”
It said Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, “meets all the competition rules” and would be able to participate in Malmö. “The Eurovision song contest remains a non-political event that unites audiences worldwide through music,” it said.

Ten countries involved in air strikes on Yemen’s Houthis – as it happened,2024-01-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/11/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-israel-gaza-war-hamas-palestine-south-africa-genocide-case-icj,"This blog is now closed
The United States and Britain have started carrying out strikes against targets linked to Houthis in Yemen, four US officials have told Reuters.
It’s the first time strikes have been launched against the Iran-backed group since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea late last year.
Associated Press is also reporting that US and British militaries have begun bombing sites used by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen in a massive retaliatory strike.
A Houthi official says ‘enemy’ raids on Sana’a are taking place, according to Reuters. A witness in Yemen’s Sana’a has also told Reuters three explosions have been heard.
Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi militants have stepped up attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea in protest against Israel’s war in Gaza. Various shipping lines have suspended operations, instead taking the longer journey around Africa.
The US military said the Houthis earlier on Thursday had staged their 27th attack on shipping since 19 November, firing an anti-ship ballistic missile into international shipping lanes in the Gulf of Aden.

A few dozen anti-war activists gathered at Times Square in New York City and outside the White House late on Thursday to protest against the US and British strikes against Houthi military targets in Yemen, Reuters has reported, saying the step threatened to widen the war in Gaza.
Protesters at Times Square chanted slogans such as “hands off the Middle East,” “hands off Yemen,” and “hands off Gaza”.
The demonstrators near the White House waved Palestinian flags and carried banners that read “Free Palestine” and “stop bombing Yemen.”
It’s currently 6:28am in Sana’a and 5:28am in Gaza and Tel Aviv. Here is a summary of the latest so far:
The United States and Britain have carried out strikes against targets linked to Houthis in Yemen. It’s the first time strikes have been launched against the Iran-backed group since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea late last year.
An official from Yemen’s Houthis has reacted to the bombings on X. Abdul Qader al-Mortada said: American-Zionist-British aggression against Yemen launches several raids on the capital, Sanaa, Hodeidah governorate, Saada, and Dhamar
The US and British militaries have used warship-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets in the strikes, several US officials told the Associated Press. The military targets include logistical hubs, air defence systems and weapons storage locations.
US president Joe Biden has released a statement on the strikes – where he highlights the countries involved in the military action – including Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands. Biden said: These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes. I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.
Britian’s prime minister Rishi Sunak has also released a statement on the military action, describing it as “limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence” and saying that the Netherlands, Canada and Bahrain offered “non-operational support”.
The UK’s Ministry of Defence said in a statement that “particular care was taken to minimise any risks to civilians” and that “early indications are that the Houthis’ ability to threaten merchant shipping has taken a blow”
Ten countries were involved in the strikes, according to a joint statement released by the White House from the government’s of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States saying they will “not hesitate to defend lives and protect the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways”.
Saudi Arabia says it is monitoring situation with “great concern”. The kingdom’s foreign ministry has told Reuters news agency it is calling for restraint and “avoiding escalation” in light of the airstrikes launched by the United States and Britain.
US defence secretary Lloyd Austin says the US is prepared to take “follow-on” action to protect US forces, Reuters reports. Austin is in hospital due to surgery complications.
Some Democrats have reacted to the military strikes saying that the president should be coming to Congress first before taking action , US representative Ro Khanna from California says “The President needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another Middle East conflict.
But US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnel was in support of the action, although he said it was “overdue”
Australia has commented on its part on the strikes in Yemen. Defence minister Richard Marles says that Australia provided personnel support to the US and UK in their strikes.
Australia has commented on its part on the strikes in Yemen. Defence minister Richard Marles says that Australia provided personnel support to the US and UK in their strikes.
Australia’s support of these actions came in the form of personnel in the operational headquarters …
Australia will continue to support any actions which assert the global rules-based order.
The United States and Britain launched strikes from the air and sea against Houthi military targets in Yemen in response to the movement’s attacks on ships in the Red Sea, in what Reuters has described as a dramatic regional widening of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.
There’s been some reaction from lawmakers in the US to president Joe Biden’s decision to go ahead with the strikes.
A Democrat, US representative Ro Khanna from California is saying that the president should be coming to Congress first before taking action:
The President needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another Middle East conflict. That is Article I of the Constitution. I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House.
But US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnel was in support of the action, although he said it was “overdue”:
I welcome the U.S. and coalition operations against the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists responsible for violently disrupting international commerce in the Red Sea and attacking American vessels. President Biden’s decision to use military force against these Iranian proxies is overdue. I am hopeful these operations mark an enduring shift in the Biden Administration’s approach to Iran and its proxies.
Some other Republicans echoed the comments that the action was overdue, including Senator Susan Collins and Roger Wicker.
Other Democrats have expressed concern about the consequences and some disquiet about the action. US representative Jason Crow from Colorado said “I would not support us being pulled into a broader war.” Mark Pocan from Wisconsin said “The United States cannot risk getting entangled into another decades-long conflict without Congressional authorization.”
Here’s some more detail on the reaction from Saudi Arabia.
The kingdom has called for restraint and “avoiding escalation” in light of the airstrikes launched by the United States and Britain against sites linked to the Houthis in Yemen. 
Reuters is reporting the kingdom’s foreign ministry has said:
The kingdom emphasizes the importance of maintaining the security and stability of the Red Sea region, as the freedom of navigation in it is an international demand
Saudi Arabia has in recent months engaged in peace talks with Yemen’s Houthis, who are an Iran-aligned group that control much of Yemen after nearly a decade of war against a western-backed and Saudi-led coalition, says Reuters.
The Houthis have also emerged as a strong supporter of Hamas in its war against Israel. The group has been attacking commercial ships it says are linked to Israel or bound for Israeli ports.
The chief negotiator for the Houthis, Mohammed Abdulsalam, said on Thursday the group’s attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea do not threaten its peace talks with Saudi Arabia.
For background on how the strikes have hit international shipping, read our piece by Jack Simpson and Sarah Butler
US defence secretary Lloyd Austin has released a statement about the strikes – saying the US is prepared to take “follow-on” action to protect US forces, Reuters reports.
Today’s strikes targeted sites associated with the Houthis’ unmanned aerial vehicle, ballistic and cruise missile, and coastal radar and air surveillance capabilities …
The United States maintains its right to self-defence and, if necessary, we will take follow-on actions to protect US forces.
Austin is in hospital due to surgery complications.
Here’s the front page of the Guardian newspaper in the UK with the strikes against Yemen’s Houthis as the top headline:
US officials have been briefing reporters and say that no retaliatory action by the Houthis has occurred yet, Reuters reports.
But one official told reporters on a conference call they would not be surprised if there were a response:
While we fully expect this action to diminish the Houthis’ capability and degrade it, and certainly over time to reduce their capacity and propensity to conduct these attacks, we would not be surprised to see some sort of response
Saudi Arabia has reacted to the airstrikes on Yemen’s Houthis.
The kingdom’s foreign ministry has told Reuters news agency it is calling for restraint and “avoiding escalation” in light of the airstrikes launched by the United States and Britain.
The statement also says Saudi Arabia is closely monitoring the situation with “great concern”.
The White House has also issued a joint statement from the government’s of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States saying they will “not hesitate to defend lives and protect the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways”.
Here’s some of that statement:
In response to continued illegal, dangerous, and destabilizing Houthi attacks against vessels, including commercial shipping, transiting the Red Sea, the armed forces of the United States and United Kingdom, with support from the Netherlands, Canada, Bahrain, and Australia, conducted joint strikes in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense, consistent with the UN Charter, against a number of targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. These precision strikes were intended to disrupt and degrade the capabilities the Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of international mariners in one of the world’s most critical waterways.
It goes on to say:
Today’s action demonstrated a shared commitment to freedom of navigation, international commerce, and defending the lives of mariners from illegal and unjustifiable attacks.
The statement ends on saying that the goal remains to “de-escalate’” tensions, but that the joint countries will also protect “lives” and the “free flow of commerce”:
Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let our message be clear: we will not hesitate to defend lives and protect the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threats.

Rojek review – unsettlingly intimate portraits of Islamic State militants,2024-01-15,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/15/rojek-review-unsettlingly-intimate-portraits-of-islamic-state-militants,"Documentary collects sequence of interviews with prisoners, not all repentant, alongside footage of war-blasted Syrian Kurdistan
Here is an astringent, devastating and truly extraordinary film that is hard work to watch, but entirely worth it. Rojek probes the roots and fallen leaves of the Syrian civil war, a conflict the western media has practically forgotten as news of Ukraine and Gaza-Israel-Yemen dominates international reporting. Director Zayne Akyol, heard off-camera throughout, interviews members of Islamic State, now being held in high security prisons by the Syrian Democratic Forces, about their lives, with some recalling more innocent days when they hunted goldfinches to sell in markets or liked Canadian pop music. Many recount how they were recruited into IS by cells in local mosques in assorted countries – Germany, say, or Saudi Arabia – and came to have positions both high-ranking and menial in the organisation in the part of Syria with a dense Kurdish population.
In the film’s present, some are still unrepentant, believers that they fought honourably in a holy war; others see things differently and are riven with regrets. Some are women who recall their time of service to IS as the happiest days of their lives. In stately procession, each person speaks straight to the camera in almost disconcerting closeup, and however repugnant some of the things they say might be, it’s impossible to not recognise and see most of them as broken human beings.
In between these intensely intimate moments, cinematographers Nicolas Canniccioni and Arshia Shakiba deploy ultra high-resolution cameras on the ground and in the sky attached to drones. This footage shows the landscape in a way that’s often startlingly beautiful, even when we’re seeing mile after mile of smashed architecture or fires burning in fields that tiny figures put out slowly with sacks that they smack on the flames. There’s even a rather beautiful tracking aerial shot watching lights going off in a garden while a party rages. Elsewhere, a stylised blend of minimalist music and recorded sound pulses away and we see a cadre of female soldiers, members of the Kurdish Women’s Protection Unit forces, practicing combat manoeuvres, operating heavy artillery, and examining vehicles at checkpoints. Those in charge now keep a wary eye out for members of IS sleeper cells, ominously mentioned by the interviewees as still out there despite the coalition’s claims of victory.
Akyol was born in Kurdistan but moved to Quebec as a child; her acclaimed debut doc Gulistan, Land of Roses explored a very personal story about a family friend who raised Akyol and then ran away to join the PKK, the revolutionary Kurdistan Workers’ party. It’s not hard to see how this film grew naturally out of the previous one, even if the voices we hear here are primarily those of Islamic zealots rather than leftist warriors. Gender and misogyny is a palpable issue here but in a baseline sort of way – the point seems to be to listen hard to these prisoners’ stories and from there try to understand them. It’s a bit like a cinematic truth and reconciliation exercise, but with highly aestheticised visuals.
There’s no attempt to lay out some larger, explanatory narrative about the civil war; instead, Akyol presents a work that impacts the viewer on a visceral level thanks to top-notch craftsmanship. While everything onscreen impresses, I couldn’t help wondering what kind of dogged effort must have gone into getting permission from the current authorities to interview these subjects, a feat of film-making persistence that probably deserves an award in itself.
 Rojek is released on 19 January at Bertha DocHouse, London.

You can read our full report on the latest US strikes on the Houthis in Yemen here and all our coverage of the Israel-Gaza war here.
The US has carried out another round of strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, US media is reporting citing US officials.
The US military fired a wave of ship- and submarine-launch missile strikes against Houthi-controlled sites on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. The strikes come after the rebel group launched a drone earlier on Wednesday that hit a US-owned bulk carrier in the Gulf of Aden.
The strikes mark the fourth time in recent days that the US has directly targeted the group in Yemen.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that have not been made public yet.

Al Jazeera reports that the death toll from Israeli shelling in Rafah overnight has risen to 16, including small children.
Earlier the broadcaster had reported that it verified footage showing the bodies of three children killed in the Israeli shelling of a house east of Rafah being brought to Abu Youssef Al Najjar hospital.
The US military has officially confirmed that it carried out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, saying that it “conducted strikes on 14 Iran-backed Houthi missiles that were loaded to be fired in Houthi controlled areas in Yemen” just before midnight on Wednesday. In a statement posted on X, the military said:
These missiles on launch rails presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and US Navy ships in the region and could have been fired at any time.
It said the strikes and “other actions we have taken” would “degrade the Houthi’s capabilities to continue their reckless attacks on international and commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden.”
US Central Command commander, Michael Erik Kurilla said:
The actions by the Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists continue to endanger international mariners and disrupt the commercial shipping lanes in the Southern Red Sea and adjacent waterways. We will continue to take actions to protect the lives of innocent mariners and we will always protect our people.”

More on Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, from where already displaced Palestinians fled late Tuesday as Israeli forces attacked nearby, prompting fears the largest hospital still partially functioning in the territory may be forced to close.
Palestinian health officials said seven people were killed by Israeli air strikes on homes near the hospital overnight to Wednesday. The UN agency OCHA said that Israeli forces withdrew from the area at around 7am on Wednesday and that initial reports and video footage showed that the nearby Al Namsawi cemetery had been destroyed and some graves empty, with bodies reportedly missing.
In a statement the Israeli army claimed that it had come under fire from the area, according to AFP.
The aid agency Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) said Israeli forces had “heavily bombed the area close to the hospital with no prior evacuation order, causing patients and many of the thousands of displaced civilians, who had sought refuge in Nasser, to flee in a panic.”
The agency’s head of mission for Palestine, Leo Cans, said during a visit to the hospital on Tuesday: “The fighting is very close. We hear bombings around and a lot of shooting. Yesterday [Monday], there was an airstrike 150 metres from the entrance of the hospital that killed eight people and injured more than 80 people. Among those were two boys, four years old and five years old who got killed.”
He said the hospital was operating at 300% capacity, adding “the situation is catastrophic. There are way too many patients for the staff to handle”.

A bit more on the latest US strikes on Yemen. The Houthi-controlled Saba news agency says US and British aircraft carried out strikes on the governates of Hodeidah, Taiz, Al-Bayda and Saada, according to Reuters.
The New York Times has meanwhile reported that US navy ships used Tomahawk cruise missiles in the strikes and “destroyed missiles and their launchers as the Houthis were preparing to fire them” citing anonymous US officials.
The AP reported that the strikes were launched from the Red Sea and hit more than a dozen sites.
US secretary of state Antony Blinken told Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that there is no military solution to Hamas and that the Israeli leader needs to recognize that or history will repeat itself during his last trip to the Middle East, the US broadcaster NBC has reported citing anonymous US officials.
Netanyahu was reportedly unmoved. He also rejected an offer by Saudi Arabia to normalise relations as part of a Gaza reconstruction agreement if Israel agrees to provide Palestinians with a pathway to statehood, the officials said.
The Biden administration is reportedly increasingly frustrated with the Israeli prime minister and is laying the groundwork for a post-Netanyahu government with other Israeli and civil society leaders.
As part of that strategy and in an attempt to work around Netanyahu, Blinken met individually with members of his war cabinet and other Israeli leaders, including opposition leader and former prime minister Yair Lapid, the officials told NBC.
The broadcaster wrote further:
The United States is now following up with Arab leaders on Blinken’s discussions, but the senior administration officials acknowledged that Biden’s lofty hopes of reshaping the Middle East are now inextricably linked to the establishment of a Palestinian state.
As a result, one senior administration official conceded, the president’s aspirations for a durable regional peace may have to await a post-Netanyahu government.
Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have been holding a candlelit vigil in Ashington DC for the hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attack on Israel after meeting with their relatives:

Israeli forces killed 10 people including two children in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, according to various sources including the UN, the Palestinian health ministry and the Israeli army, while two paramedics were injured and another two detained.
The UN agency OCHA said six people were killed, including two children, in an airstrike on Tulkarem refugee camp. In its daily update on hostilities it reported:
In the early morning, Israeli forces raided the camp, where clashes erupted between Israeli forces and Palestinians, including an exchange of gunfire and the use of explosive devices by the latter was reported.
Subsequently, an Israeli airstrike targeted a group of Palestinians, killing four, including two children.
During the operation, seven Palestinians, including two PCRS paramedics, and one Israeli soldier had been injured.
An ambulance was severely damaged by shrapnel and two Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) paramedics were detained by Israeli forces.
The Israeli military confirmed it carried out an air strike during the Tulkarem raid, adding that “a number of terrorists were killed in the strike”.
A separate airstrike near Balata refugee camp, east of the city of Nablus, killed five fighters with the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas’s Fatah party, the brigade said in a statement.
The group and the Israeli army said Ahmed Abdullah Abu Shalal, a Palestinian militant, had been killed, with Israel saying it had averted a “terrorist attack” he was planning.
OCHA said Israeli forces took the bodies of four of the dead while a fifth was “incinerated” in the strike. It also said that Israeli forces reportedly prevented PRCS ambulances from accessing the location and opened fire at them.
Israeli forces and settlers have killed 355 Palestinians including 90 children since Hamas’ 7 October attack on Israel, according to OCHA.
A World Health Organization official has described dire conditions in the Gaza Strip’s remaining hospitals, where patients are “waiting to die” due to extreme shortages of staff and supplies. AFP reports:
Emergency medical team coordinator Sean Casey said that during some five weeks he spent in the war-torn Palestinian territory, he saw hospital patients “every day with severe burns, with open fractures waiting hours or days” for treatment.
“They would often ask me for food or water – that demonstrates the level of desperation that we see,” Casey told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.
He said he was only able to visit six of Gaza’s 16 functioning hospitals, out of 36 that existed before the war broke out.
“What I’ve seen personally is a rapid deterioration of the health system alongside a rapidly increasing level of humanitarian aid and diminishing level of humanitarian access particularly to areas in the north of the Strip.”
He described seeing patients in the north who were “basically waiting to die in a hospital that has no fuel, no power, no water.”
“We tried every single day for seven days to deliver fuel and supplies to the north to Gaza City,” Casey said. “Every day, those requests for coordinated movements were denied.”
The hospitals are facing a deluge of patients while operating with minimal staff, many of whom – like the vast majority of Gaza’s population – have been displaced from their homes, Casey said.
“Hospital directors were telling me how their surgeons, plastic surgeon, for example, could not do surgery, because he was out collecting sticks to burn his firewood to cook for his family.” …
Echoing similar calls by WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Casey said the most critical need in Gaza “is really a ceasefire.”
“Everything short of that is simply addressing needs on a day by day basis.”
In the south, Casey said he visited the Nasser medical complex, where “they had only 30 percent of their staff remaining and about 200 percent of their bed capacity – so patients everywhere in the corridors on the floor.”
“I went to the burn unit where there was one physician caring for 100 patients,” he said.
The “humanitarian catastrophe that’s unfolding every day is getting worse and worse” Casey said, in addition to “the collapse of the health system day by day.”
Al Jazeera has reported that at least six Palestinians including three children have been killed in Israeli attacks overnight to Thursday.
The broadcaster said it had verified footage showing the bodies of three children arriving at Abu Youssef Al Najjar hospital after Israeli forces shelled a house belonging to the al-Zamili family, in the city of Rafah, southern Gaza.
It also reported the deaths of another three Palestinians killed in an attack near Abu Husni street in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, citing the Palestinian news agency Wafa. An unknown number of people were also reportedly killed in an Israeli attack of the home of the al-Huti family in the Shaboura refugee camp.
Wafa also reported that two Palestinians were killed and two injured after an Israeli attack on a gathering of people in Rafah – it was not immediately clear if this was the same as the attack on the al-Zamili family home or a separate incident.
British foreign secretary David Cameron has met his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian at the World Economic Forum, according to Reuters.
Cameron condemned Iran’s attack on Erbil in Iraq earlier this week, in which UK-Iraqi dual national Karam Mikhael was among those killed, the foreign office said in a statement.
Cameron also made it clear that the Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea are “illegal and unacceptable”, the foreign office said. The foreign secretary added that Iran must use its influence with the Houthis to prevent further threats.
Iran must cease supplying the Houthis with weapons and intelligence and use its influence to stop Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.Iran must also stop using the regional situation as cover to act recklessly and violate others’ sovereignty. I made this clear to FM @Amirabdolahian

"The impossible choice for my family in Gaza: stay and be killed together, or move and risk dying apart | Ghada Ageel",2024-01-18,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/18/gaza-stay-killed-together-dying-apart,"‘Will I take my books and my schoolbag?’ my niece asked as her parents packed the essentials: blankets, documents, food. There was no way to explain
In my home town of Khan Younis, a refugee camp to the south of the Gaza Strip, my family home has finally been evacuated. The building suffered substantial damage when 36 of my relatives were killed in a bombing on 26 October. But they had clung on to the small piece of safety they felt they had there and continued to live in the home anyway. Then, on Christmas Day, the terrifying news fell from the sky written on leaflets – a directive to evacuate.
In the Christian story of Jesus, his mother and father travelled the land looking for somewhere safe to stay. Everywhere they heard: “There is no room at the inn.” Later, fleeing with their infant to Egypt for safety, one of the places they visited was Gaza. For Palestinians, more than 2,000 years later, the question remains: “Where can we go?”
My brothers and their families had no time for contemplation. For them, moments like these are not just a stark choice between life and death. They are worse than that: a choice between dying in one place, or another. People in Gaza are asking themselves: shall we stay in our homes and face inevitable death together; or leave, and die in a strange place, perhaps alone? Many have witnessed the unfolding genocide and preferred to stay in their homes and die with their families. This way they might be helped, or rescued. Or their bodies might be identified. Or – at least – they might be buried and not left for the cats and dogs to eat.
My brothers and their families gathered the essentials: blankets, mattresses, pillows, clothes, kitchen necessities, food and water, important documents and cherished valuables. The adults quickly made decisions about what to take and what to leave. However, the eight children, aged between three and 16, wanted to pack everything precious to them. My nieces’ and nephews’ tears flowed as their parents rejected most of their choices. Sixteen-year-old Amal, who dreams of one day being a doctor, asked, “Will this be our last day at home? Will we ever return? Will I take my books and my schoolbag?” But there was no time or way to explain.
My family decided to move to al-Mawasi, on the Mediterranean coast, which had been declared a safe zone. Eventually, they found a man driving a donkey cart, and paid him $US70 (about a week or two’s salary for a typical person in Gaza) to take them there. Half of this man’s family had been lost when their home was bombed, he told them. He had travelled south, with his children, from Gaza City’s al-Shati refugee camp in a desperate search for safety, and had been living in Khan Younis with his family in a UN school since then. He joked darkly that this trip with my family might be his last one but at least the money would help his remaining children survive a few more weeks. All the time they were travelling, drones flew overhead, ready to target any moving object. A seemingly straightforward trip that would usually take 20 minutes on foot became a harrowing odyssey.
Al-Mawasi is one of Gaza’s most beautiful beach areas, once a popular spot for families. Today it is a scene of desperation, not recreation. By the time my family arrived there, tents, plastic and even pieces of wood were nowhere to be found – they had all been claimed and utilised by those seeking shelter. In a desperate attempt to combat the biting cold or cook their food, people had resorted to burning anything they could find, be it remnants from their homes, debris from the streets or materials salvaged from under the rubble. My siblings made their shelter using blankets and whatever little plastic they could gather.
That night, sleep was impossible. The bitter cold and darkness, interrupted by the bombs, the roar of the waves, the sound of the wind and the cries of adults and children from neighbouring tents created an environment of perpetual distress. In the following days and nights, homelessness exposed them to the appalling realities of war, from which their home had shielded them until 25 December. They saw people with life-threatening injuries forced to sleep in tents or on the sand; children with amputated limbs cried out in pain and despair, cold and hungry. Four-year-old Shahd now refuses to leave the tent as she is unable to fathom what is happening around her.
In our last conversation, my sister-in-law Arwa painted to me a picture of desperation and humiliation: the queues for inadequate rations of food and water; the absence of proper facilities for basic needs such as toilets and showers (especially for women and girls); once-dignified individuals reduced to begging. The onset of diarrhoea further intensified the misery and indignity.
Then the horror from the death-raining sky descended upon al-Mawasi on 4 January, when Israeli airstrikes hit tents not far away. The shelling ended the lives of the Abu Hattab and Salah families: 10 children and their parents, obliterated in an instant. Panic and chaos followed as people scattered, screaming, only to return to the tents to discover who had survived and who had not. People gathered to bury the victims and evacuate the wounded to Nasser hospital on donkey carts. There was no time to inform relatives or family members.
My nieces and nephews were terrified. In the nights that followed, Shahd cried to return home, fearing the next shell would hit their tent. A few days later, I spoke to my brother, who shared the grim reality: “We survived, but we don’t know what tomorrow holds for us. It is like living in a chicken coop, waiting to be slaughtered. Every day they come and pick 300, 400 or 500 to slaughter. Our turn is yet to come.”
Sadly, this account is not unique. It is only one example of the horrors experienced each day by Gaza’s 2.3 million people. We have become the pawns in a regional struggle for power.
The UK and US governments claim they are upholding international law by attacking the Houthis in Yemen. But they are not doing enough to uphold international law in Gaza. Israel claims that a new phase of the conflict has begun, yet the indiscriminate bombing of families and civilians continues. Without an immediate ceasefire, the people of Gaza will continue to bear the brunt of the world’s failure to act. My greatest fear is that the next time I hear from Gaza, it will be about yet another heartbreaking episode of loss within my own family.

‘Different rules’: special policies keep US supplying weapons to Israel despite alleged abuses,2024-01-18,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/us-supply-weapons-israel-alleged-abuses-human-rights,"Revealed: review of internal state department documents shows special mechanisms have been used to shield Israel from US human rights laws
Top US officials quietly reviewed more than a dozen incidents of alleged gross violations of human rights by Israeli security forces since 2020, but have gone to great lengths to preserve continued access to US weapons for the units responsible for the alleged violations, contributing – former US officials say – to the sense of impunity with which Israel has approached its war in Gaza.
An estimated 24,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed by Israeli forces since Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, a death toll that has spurred condemnation of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the US president, Joe Biden, who has been criticized for failing to rein in Israel’s “indiscriminate” bombing of Gaza.
An investigation by the Guardian, which was based on a review of internal state department documents and interviews with people familiar with sensitive internal deliberations, reveals how special mechanisms have been used over the last few years to shield Israel from US human rights laws, even as other allies’ military units who receive US support – including, sources say, Ukraine – have privately been sanctioned and faced consequences for committing human rights violations.
State department officials have in effect been able to circumvent the US law that is meant to prevent US complicity in human rights violations by foreign military units – the 1990s-era Leahy law, named after the now retired Vermont senator Patrick Leahy – because, former officials say, extraordinary internal state department policies have been put in place that show extreme deference to the Israeli government. No such special arrangements exist for any other US ally.
The lack of enforcement of the Leahy law in Israel appears especially troubling to its namesake. In a statement to the Guardian, the former Vermont senator said the purpose of the Leahy law was to shield the US from culpability for gross violations of human rights by foreign security forces that receive US aid and deter future violations.
“But the law has not been applied consistently, and what we have seen in the West Bank and Gaza is a stark example of that. Over many years I urged successive US administrations to apply the law there, but it has not happened,” Leahy said.
Among the incidents that have been reviewed since 2020 were the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh, the Palestinian-American journalist who was shot by Israeli forces in May 2022; the death of Omar Assad, a 78-year-old Palestinian-American, who died in January 2022 after being held in Israeli custody; and the alleged extrajudicial killing of Ahmad Abdu, a 25-year-old who was shot at dawn by Israeli forces in May 2021 while sitting in his car.
A report in Haaretz describes how, after opening fire on the car, Israeli troops pulled Abdu out, dragged him a few meters down the road, then left his bloody body in the road and departed.
In the review into Abdu’s death, which reports suggest may have been a case of mistaken identity, internal state department documents note that Israel declined to respond to questions by state department officials about the shooting.
In Omar Assad’s case, the Israeli military said last June it was not bringing criminal charges against soldiers who were involved in his death, even after he was alleged to have been dragged from a car, bound and blindfolded after being stopped at a checkpoint. The army said the soldiers would not face prosecution because their actions could not directly be linked to Assad’s death from cardiac arrest, the Associated Press reported. Assad, a US citizen, had spent about 40 years in the midwest before retiring home to the West Bank in 2009.
Internal state department documents show that the incidents were reviewed under a little-known process established by the state department in 2020 known as the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum (ILVF), in which representatives from relevant state department bureaus examine reports of alleged human rights violations by Israeli forces.
Under the Leahy law, for most countries and in most cases, a foreign military unit is granted US military assistance or training after it is vetted by the state department for any reported human rights violations. The law prohibits the Department of State and the Department of Defense from providing funds, assistance or training to foreign security force units where there is “credible information” that the forces have committed a gross violation of human rights.
In the case of at least three countries – Israel, Ukraine and Egypt – the scale of foreign assistance is so great that US military assistance can be difficult to track, and the US often has no knowledge of where specific weapons end up or how they are used.
To close what was seen as a loophole in the law, Congress updated the process in 2019, by putting a system in place that prohibits the foreign government from providing US assistance to any unit of its security forces that the US identifies as being ineligible under the Leahy law due to a gross violation of human rights. The state department set up working groups to examine those countries where military assistance is considered “untraceable”.
But people familiar with the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Israel had benefited from extraordinary policies inside the ILVF, details of which have not previously been reported.
“Nobody said it but everyone knew the rules were different for Israel. No one will ever admit that, but it’s the truth,” said one former state department official.
First, under the Israel process, all of the parties involved in an ILVF review must reach a consensus that a potential violation has occurred, and must then be approved by the deputy secretary of state, according to three people familiar with internal deliberations. In theory, a single bureau could raise a potential violation to the deputy secretary of state level as part of a “split memo”, in which other bureaus would air their disagreement, but no such thing has occurred. Among the groups that are involved in the process are the bureau of near eastern affairs, the bureau of democracy, human rights and labor, the bureau of political-military affairs and the US embassy in Jerusalem.
For other countries, former officials said, such a Leahy law determination is made by state department staff, does not require the consensus of all parties, and would not require notification of and approval by the secretary of state or deputy.
Second, Israel must be consulted about alleged human rights violations that are under review and has 90 days to respond to claims, creating what some former officials said were significant delays. No other country’s government must be consulted under state department procedures, former officials said.
“Part of the reason why the ILVF has never worked is that the process is so gummed up with delay mechanisms that exist for no other country,” the former state department official said.
A state department spokesperson said details of internal department deliberations could not be discussed, but that there was “no requirement that consensus among ILVF participants be reached in order to move forward with an assessment under the Leahy law”.
“The department conducts Leahy vetting consistent with the law in the case of all countries receiving applicable assistance, including Israel,” the spokesperson added.
In response to questions about why consultation with Israel was considered part of the state department’s standard practice in all Israel Leahy vetting cases, the spokesperson said the department “routinely consults foreign governments on Leahy vetting matters, not just Israel”.
Some experts see a connection between the US’s hands-off approach to Israel on human rights violations and Israel’s conduct in the war in Gaza. Israel receives $3.8bn in military assistance annually and the Biden administration twice bypassed Congress last month to deliver an additional $250m in weapons. Progressive Democrats led by Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator, have called on aid to Israel being conditioned on the US investigating potential human rights violations by Israel in its war in Gaza.
“I think Israel feels a broad impunity when it comes to consequences within the US for its actions,” said Josh Paul, a former state department official who has emerged as a vocal critic of the Biden administration policies on Israel. “We may say that Israel should abide by international humanitarian law. We may say that it should not expand settlements. But when it comes to actual consequences, there aren’t any and I think that has given Israel at senior government levels the sense that it is immune.”
Paul also sees the lack of Leahy law enforcement having an effect on how Israeli units are conducting themselves. By not pressing Israel on Leahy violations and not designating individual Israeli units as gross violators of human rights, Paul said the US has enabled a culture of impunity at the unit level, which he said “we see on the ground in Gaza today” in the actions of some Israeli soldiers, including videos that have circulated showing Israeli soldiers ransacking private homes in Gaza, destroying civilian property and using racist language.
Nowhere is the US’s double standard on Israel more apparent than in a 2021 agreement that was signed by a senior state department official, Jessica Lewis, who serves as assistant secretary for political affairs, and the Israel ambassador to the US, Michael Herzog.
The two-page 2021 agreement, which has received little media attention, formalized changes in the Leahy law and included a statement about how Israel has a “robust, independent and effective legal system, including its military justice system”. The US signed more than two dozen similar agreements with other countries at that time – including Greece, Jordan, Georgia, Ukraine and Latvia – but none contain language endorsing the other countries’ military justice systems.
Former officials who spoke to the Guardian said they did not know how the language came to be included in the US-Israel agreement, but speculated it was probably added by Israel.
The Guardian requested a comment on the matter from the Israeli embassy in Washington, including on the provenance of the statement contained in the agreement, but did not receive a response.
Tim Rieser, a longtime senior adviser to Leahy, who helped write the Leahy law in the 1990s, said the inclusion of the language was probably intended to help Israel avoid scrutiny under the Leahy law, because it suggests as a matter of fact that Israel’s military justice system is independent enough to address any alleged human rights violations.
“The language added to the US-Israel agreement, without any consultation with Congress, is factually inaccurate and wrongly suggests that the [Leahy] Law doesn’t need to be applied,” Rieser said.
Few organizations have been as critical of Israel’s military justice system than B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group.
“The military law enforcement system is used by Israel as a whitewash mechanism whose purpose is to block any criticism of Israel’s and the army’s policies in the territories. The percentage of convictions of soldiers is close to zero, even for the most serious violations,” said Dror Sadot, B’Tselem spokesperson.
Paul, the former state department official who resigned from his post in protest against the Biden administration’s “blind support for one side”, said he had long argued internally that the US ought not to consider Israel’s military justice system as a “responsible functional justice system” when it comes to abuses.
“I think the track record is really one of slaps on the wrist, temporary demotions, and short-term suspensions even for really serious violations,” said Paul.
Paul told the Guardian “numerous people”, including himself, raised concerns over the years inside the state department that the Leahy process “is not working” and that gross violations of human rights were occurring “without accountability”. Indeed, no Israeli unit has ever gotten to the point of being sanctioned under the Leahy law even though credible allegations of gross human rights violations exist.
Paul declined to name former colleagues and did not want to discuss specific cases that were reviewed by the forum, but said that typically, staff concerns about Israeli human rights violations were ultimately “killed” at what he described as the front office level or bureau leadership-level within several of the bureaus involved in the forum, including the Bureau of Human Rights (DRL).
Other cases that were reviewed by the ILVF, but where US officials ultimately declined to reach consensus and take action include: the killing of Sanad Salem al-Harbad, a Bedouin man who was allegedly shot twice in the back by Israeli police in March 2022; the killing of Ahmad Jamil Fahd, who was allegedly shot by police and left to bleed to death by a unit of undercover Israeli agents; the alleged assault in Israeli police custody of journalist Givara Budeiri; the 2020 killing of a 32-year-old unarmed autistic man Eyad al-Hallaq by Israeli police in East Jerusalem; the killing of a 15-year-old boy named Mohammed Hamayel; and the shooting of 16-year-old Palestinian Jana Kiswani.
For advocates of the Leahy law, like Rieser, the lack of accountability for the killing of Abu Akleh, the prominent Al Jazeera journalist, is particularly galling, and has been the subject of criticism by senior Democrats on Capitol Hill.
“If the US had been willing to apply the Leahy law in Israel the IDF would presumably have been more inclined to hold their soldiers accountable, which would have helped deter killings of civilians like Shireen Abu Akleh and many others, and what we are seeing today,” Rieser said. “Or else they would have faced a cut-off of US aid, which would have been a real black mark and a thorn in US-Israel relations.”
Abu Akleh was killed by a bullet that hit the back of her head while covering an Israeli operation in the West Bank city of Jenin. A CNN investigation found that there was no active combat or Palestinian militants near Abu Akleh in the moments before she was killed, and footage obtained by the network corroborated witness testimony that suggested Israeli forces had taken aim at the journalist.
The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) apologized for the killing last year but the military advocate general’s office in Israel said in a statement that it did not intend to pursue criminal charges or prosecutions of any of the soldiers involved.
In a July 2023 letter to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, four Democratic senators – Chris Van Hollen, Leahy (now retired), Chris Murphy and Dick Durbin – criticized the Biden administration for not following through on earlier calls for an “independent, credible investigation”. In questions to the administration, the senators asked what, if any, steps the United States Security Coordinator (USSC), who conducted an independent forensic analysis of the bullet that killed Abu Akleh, took to try to establish who specifically shot her and why.
Echoing statements by the IDF, the USCC released a short statement that there was “no reason to believe that this was intentional but rather the result of tragic circumstances”. The state department has declined to publicly release a report into Abu Akleh’s death by the USSC coordinator, Lt Gen Michael Fenzel. Citing a senior US official, Axios reported last year that Fenzel’s report did not include any new findings or conclusions.
When the Leahy law was first passed in 1997, it was designed with Central America and Colombia in mind. The US was providing hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to combat narco-traffickers and insurgents, but human rights groups were documenting serious human rights abuses by Colombian military and police units. While the state department does not publicly announce when it targets specific foreign units, experts say they believe it has been effective in Central America, Colombia, Nepal and other countries.
Israel, they say, is the outlier.
Rieser said there was a long history of correspondence – from the George W Bush administration through to the Biden administration – between Leahy and successive secretaries of state seeking answers to why the Leahy law was not being implemented in cases involving killings of Palestinians.
In a May 2002 letter to then secretary Colin Powell, who served in the Bush administration, Leahy raised concerns that the Leahy law was not being applied to the Middle East.
In a January 2009 letter to then secretary Condoleezza Rice, Leahy expressed incredulity that the state department was “unaware” of a single incident involving the IDF that would trigger the Leahy law.
A month later, Leahy sent a new letter to then secretary Hillary Clinton, who was serving under the Obama administration. He attached copies of correspondence he had sent her predecessor.
A February 2016 letter from Leahy to the then secretary of state, John Kerry, cited a “disturbing number of reports of possible gross violations of human rights by security forces in Israel and Egypt”, including “extrajudicial killings by Israeli military and police”.
An October 2017 letter to Rex Tillerson, who served as secretary of state under Donald Trump, queried what steps the US embassy in Israel was taking to ensure the Leahy law was being applied to the IDF.
Later, in a May 2018 letter from Leahy to the then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who served in the Trump administration, Leahy sought a Leahy law review of the shooting deaths of about 100 Palestinian protesters from Gaza who had been killed since March of that year. “If credible information exists to trigger the Leahy law regarding any Israeli unit and the Government of Israel is not taking effective steps to bring the individuals responsible to justice, such a unit is no longer eligible for US assistance,” Leahy wrote.
In a follow-up letter in September, Leahy pushed for a “clear answer”, including whether the administration had ever sought the identity of the IDF units who shot the Palestinians. In another letter, sent by Leahy in December, he questioned how many times the US embassy had presented Israel with evidence of gross violations of human rights, and how many times those individuals were barred from receiving US assistance.
Several other letters from Leahy refer to gross violations of human rights by the IDF. None of the cases ever led to a unit being punished.

"Gaza conditions go from catastrophe ‘to near collapse’, says Unicef – as it happened",2024-01-19,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/18/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-latest-news-us-military-strikes-houthi-rebels-yemen-pakistan-attack-iran,"This blog is now closed. See all our coverage of the Middle East crisis here
Children in Gaza are suffering from “horrific conditions” and the Palestinian territory remains the most dangerous place in the world to be a child, the deputy chief of the UN children’s agency says.
Ted Chaiban said at the end of a three-day visit to Gaza on Thursday that since his last visit two months ago “the situation has gone from catastrophe to near collapse”.
If the staggering decline in conditions persists, “we could see deaths due to indiscriminate conflict compounded by deaths due to disease and hunger”, the Unicef deputy executive director said in a statement, Associated Press reports.
Chaiban said he met an 11-year-old girl named Sama on Tuesday at al-Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. She was skipping with friends when shrapnel from a bombing pierced her abdomen, leading to the loss of her spleen. Now, he said, her immune system was compromised “in a war zone full of disease and infection”.
Ten minutes later, he said, he met 13-year-old Ibrahim who had been in a shelter in a designated safe area when everything collapsed. His badly damaged hand went untreated, became gangrenous, and his arm had to be amputated.
Chaiban said:
A matter of hours after we left, many families fled al-Nasser hospital, as fighting closed in on the area.
The “war on children” must stop, he said, pointing to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that nearly 25,000 people have been killed since 7 October, with up to 70% of them reportedly women and children.
It’s almost 4.30am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv and 5.30am in Sanaa, Yemen, and we’re about to shut this blog. Our live coverage of the Middle East crisis will resume later in the day. Here’s a summary of the latest developments. Thanks for reading.
The US has carried out a fifth strike against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, even as Joe Biden acknowledged that bombing the rebels has yet to stop their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. Late on Thursday US warplanes targeted anti-ship missiles that “were aimed into the southern Red Sea and prepared to launch”, according to US Central Command. The US president told reporters: “When you say working, are they stopping the Houthis? No. Are they going to continue? Yes.”
Also on Thursday night, Houthis fired missiles at a US-owned tanker ship in the Gulf of Aden. The White House and the Houthis gave differing accounts of the launches at the Chem Ranger, with the rebels saying their naval forces had attacked “with several appropriate naval missiles, resulting in direct hits”. However, US Central Command said the Houthis launched two anti-ship ballistic missiles and that they hit the water near the ship, causing no damage or injuries. It said it was the third Houthi strike on a commercial shipping vessel in three days.
A total of 24,620 Palestinians have been killed and 61,830 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures by the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry on Thursday. The figures include 172 killed and 326 injured in the past 24 hours. At least 16 people were reported killed by an Israeli airstrike on a house in Rafah, southern Gaza.
A new wave of violence has swept the West Bank, with a series of major raids launched by the Israeli military across much of the occupied territory. Israeli forces remained in Tulkarm, in the West Bank’s north, for a second day on Thursday after launching a raid on a refugee camp there. Eight people were killed on Thursday, the Israeli military said.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has told the Biden White House that he rejects any moves to establish a Palestinian state when Israel ends its offensive against Gaza, and that all territory west of the Jordan River would be under Israeli security control. His public statement on Thursday represented his sharpest rebuttal of US foreign policy. The White House responded by saying the US would continue working towards a two-state solution and that there could be no Israeli reoccupation of Gaza when the war concluded.
Pakistan has launched retaliatory strikes against militants in Iran in response to attacks by Tehran that targeted sites within Pakistan’s borders, heightening fears of further instability across the Middle East and surrounding region. Ten people from one family were killed in the attacks, including six children, reportedly all “non Iranian nationals”.
Children in Gaza are suffering from “horrific conditions” and the Palestinian territory remains the most dangerous place in the world to be a child, the deputy chief of the UN children’s agency says. Ted Chaiban said at the end of a three-day visit to Gaza that since his last visit two months ago “the situation has gone from catastrophe to near collapse”. If the staggering decline in conditions persisted, “we could see deaths due to indiscriminate conflict compounded by deaths due to disease and hunger”, the Unicef deputy executive director said.
There was no word on Thursday on whether medicines that entered Gaza as part of a deal brokered by France and Qatar had been distributed to dozens of hostages with chronic illnesses who are being held by Hamas. Qatar confirmed late on Wednesday that the medicine had entered Gaza, but it was not yet clear if it had been distributed to the hostages, who are being held in secret locations.
The EU is set to adopt sanctions against Hamas on Monday that will “target individuals and ban money transfers”, according to the French foreign ministry. EU foreign ministers were also expected to discuss possible measures against violent Israeli settlers, a ministry spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the European parliament has voted to call for a “permanent ceasefire” in the Gaza Strip, but on condition that all Israeli hostages held in the territory are released and Hamas dismantled. The resolution on Thursday, which is non-binding, stopped short of calling for an unconditional ceasefire in Gaza.
Mexico and Chile have asked the international criminal court (ICC) to investigate possible crimes against civilians in Gaza. In a statement, Mexico’s foreign ministry said the action “is due to growing worry over the latest escalation of violence, particularly against civilian targets.” Any proceedings by the ICC would be separate from South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide at the UN’s international court of justice.
An airstrike on southern Syria early on Thursday killed at least nine people and was probably carried out by Jordan’s air force, Syrian opposition activists said, after the latest in a series of strikes in an area where cross-border drug smugglers have been active. There was no immediate confirmation from Jordan on the strike that hit the province of Sweida, and there was some confusion over the number of people killed.
Israel has joined a notorious band of authoritarian states with a history of imprisoning journalists by detaining Palestinian reporters without trial since the beginning of the latest war in Gaza. A report by the Committee to Protect Journalists released on Thursday said that for the first time, Israel figures in its list of “worst jailers of journalists”, putting it on a par with Iran.

The White House and Houthi rebels have given differing accounts of a Houthi attack on a US-owned tanker ship on Thursday night.
The Huthis said on social media that their “naval” forces had attacked the Chem Ranger in the Gulf of Aden “with several appropriate naval missiles, resulting in direct hits”.
However, US Central Command said later that the Houthi launched two anti-ship ballistic missiles at the Chem Ranger and that they hit water near the ship, causing no damage to the vessel or injuries.
It said on X (formerly Twitter) that the third Houthi strike on a commercial shipping vessel in three days occurred about 9pm local time.
The Chem Ranger continued its journey after the incident, it added, saying the tanker ship was Marshall Island-flagged, US-owned and Greek-operated.

The US military says Yemeni Houthis have launched two anti-ship ballistic missiles at a US-owned tanker ship, Reuters reports in a breaking news snap.
There was no reported damage or injuries, the US said.
More on this story as it emerges.
Earlier on Friday, the Houthis claimed to have targeted a US ship in the Gulf of Aden with naval missiles, resulting in “direct hits”.
It was not immediately clear if the reports referred to the same attack.
There was no word on Thursday on whether medicines that entered Gaza as part of a deal brokered by France and Qatar had been distributed to dozens hostages with chronic illnesses who are being held by Hamas.
The agreement was the first to be brokered between the warring sides since November and includes large shipments of medicine, food and humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians as well.
Associated Press reports that Qatar confirmed late on Wednesday that the medicine had entered Gaza, but it was not yet clear if it had been distributed to the hostages, who are being held in secret locations including underground bunkers.
The International Committee for the Red Cross, which helped facilitate the hostage releases, said it was not involved in distributing the medicine.
Israeli war cabinet minister Gadi Eisenkot has appeared to criticise Benjamin Netanyahu’s pledge to completely defeat Hamas, suggesting that such rhetoric is unrealistic, the Times of Israel reports.
“Whoever speaks of absolute defeat is not speaking the truth,” Eisenkot told Channel 12’s Uvda investigative program hours after the prime minister pledged to continue the war until “complete victory” over the militant group.
Asked whether Israel’s current leadership was telling the public the truth, Eisenkot responded: “No.”
Eisenkot, a former chief of the Israel Defence Forces, also appeared to criticise Netanyahu’s refusal to hold high-level discussions regarding post-war planning in Gaza.
Eisenkot said:
The goals of the war have not yet been achieved, but the [number of soldiers on the ground] is now more limited… You have to think about what’s next.
There’s more on Yemen’s Houthi rebels claiming to have fired “naval missiles” at a US ship in the Gulf of Aden on Thursday.
The Huthis said in a statement on their social media that their “naval” forces had attacked the Chem Ranger “with several appropriate naval missiles, resulting in direct hits”, Agence France-Presse reports.
British maritime risk management company Ambrey said the Chem Ranger was a US-owned Marshall Islands-flagged chemical tanker.
“There were no crew casualties or damage reported,” the monitor said.
Chem Ranger was sailing from Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to Shuwaik in Kuwait when it reported a “suspicious” approach by drones, Ambrey said. One fell in the sea about 30 metres from the tanker, it added. “An Indian warship responded to the event.”
Huthi aggression against vessels in the Red Sea has led to strikes in Yemen by US and British forces, with the US reporting its latest attack on Huthi targets on Thursday.
The Iran-backed Huthis have launched and gradually increased attacks on Red Sea shipping since the Gaza war erupted on 7 October with the Hamas attack on Israel.
The Huthi statement said the rebels were acting against “the oppression of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and within the response to the American-British aggression against our country”.
The statement did not give a time or other details for the latest attack in international shipping lanes.
As the US announced its latest attack on the Huthis on Thursday, President Joe Biden said they would continue until the rebels stopped targeting ships in the Red Sea.
The US president, Joe Biden, said the clashes between Iran and Pakistan this week showed that Iran was not well-liked in the region as the White House said it did not want to see an escalation.
Pakistan launched strikes on separatist militants inside Iran on Thursday, in a retaliatory attack two days after Tehran said it struck the bases of another group within Pakistani territory.
Reuters reports Biden said on Thursday:
As you can see Iran is not particularly well liked in the region and where that goes, we’re working on now. I don’t know where that goes.
The US has been locked in a test of wills with Iran over its support for Houthi rebels in Yemen who have been launching attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
The White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters on Air Force One as Biden flew to North Carolina that Washington was monitoring the Iran-Pakistan clashes closely.
Kirby said:
We don’t want to see an escalation clearly in South and Central Asia. And we’re in touch with our Pakistani counterparts.
Kirby said the attack on Pakistan was another example of Iran’s destabilising behaviour in the region.

Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
A total of 24,620 Palestinians have been killed and 61,830 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures by the Gaza health ministry on Thursday. The figures include 172 killed and 326 injured in the past 24 hours. At least 16 people have been killed by an Israeli airstrike on a house in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip. A relative of those killed told Al Jazeera that the family had relocated within Gaza three times for safety since 7 October. Israel’s military has repeatedly ordered Gaza’s civilian population to flee to the south.
A new wave of violence has swept the occupied West Bank, with a series of major raids launched by the Israeli military across much of the territory. Israeli forces remained in Tulkarm, in the north of the West Bank, for a second day on Thursday after launching a raid on a refugee camp there. Eight people were killed on Thursday, the Israeli military said.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has told the Biden White House that he rejects any moves to establish a Palestinian state when Israel ends its offensive against Gaza, and that all territory west of the Jordan River would be under Israeli security control. His public statement on Thursday represented his sharpest rebuttal of US foreign policy. The White House responded by saying the US would continue working towards a two-state solution and that there could be no Israeli reoccupation of Gaza when the war concluded.
Internet and mobile services continue to be cut off inside the Gaza Strip by Israel. The present outage has lasted for five days, according to internet access advocacy group NetBlocks. An estimated 85% of Gaza’s population have been displaced and are struggling for food, while local authorites say nearly 25,000 Palestinians have so far been killed by Israeli airstrikes since 7 October.
A Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson has admitted that it is difficult to confirm if a shipment of medicine has reached Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Majed al-Ansari said medicine and aid for Israeli hostages and Palestinian civilians had entered Gaza on Wednesday under a deal mediated by Qatar and France, and that there was every “likelihood” that the medication had reached the Israeli hostages.
The US has carried out a fifth strike against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, even as Joe Biden acknowledged that bombing the rebels has yet to stop their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. Late on Thursday US warplanes targeted anti-ship missiles that “were aimed into the southern Red Sea and prepared to launch,” according to US Central Command. “When you say working, are they stopping the Houthis? No. Are they going to continue? Yes,” the US president told reporters on Thursday.
The EU is set to adopt sanctions against Hamas on Monday that will “target individuals and ban money transfers”, according to a French foreign ministry spokesperson. EU foreign ministers are also expected to discuss possible measures against violent Israeli settlers, they said. Meanwhile, the European parliament has voted to call for a “permanent ceasefire” in the Gaza Strip, but on condition that all Israeli hostages held in the territory are released and Hamas dismantled. The resolution on Thursday, which is non-binding, stopped short of calling for an unconditional ceasefire in Gaza.
Mexico and Chile have asked the international criminal court (ICC) to investigate possible crimes against civilians in Gaza. In a statement, Mexico’s foreign ministry said the action “is due to growing worry over the latest escalation of violence, particularly against civilian targets.” Any proceedings by the ICC would be separate from South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide at the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ).
An airstrike on southern Syria early on Thursday killed at least nine people and was probably carried out by Jordan’s air force, Syrian opposition activists said, the latest in a series of strikes in an area where cross-border drug smugglers have been active. There was no immediate confirmation from Jordan on the strike that hit the province of Sweida, and there was some confusion over the number of people killed.
Pakistan has launched retaliatory strikes against militants in Iran in response to attacks by Tehran that targeted sites within Pakistan’s borders, heightening fears of further instability across the Middle East and surrounding region. Ten people from one family were killed in the attacks, including six children, reportedly all “non Iranian nationals”.
Israel has joined a notorious band of authoritarian states with a history of imprisoning journalists by detaining Palestinian reporters without trial since the beginning of the latest war in Gaza. A report by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) released on Thursday said that for the first time, Israel figures in its list of “worst jailers of journalists”, putting it on a par with Iran.
Mexico and Chile have asked the international criminal court (ICC) to investigate possible crimes against civilians in Gaza.
In a statement, Mexico’s foreign ministry argued that the ICC was the proper forum to establish potential criminal responsibility, “whether committed by agents of the occupying power or the occupied power”. It added:
The action by Mexico and Chile is due to growing worry over the latest escalation of violence, particularly against civilian targets.
Mexico cited “numerous reports from the United Nations that detail many incidents that could constitute crimes under the ICC’s jurisdiction.”
Chile supports “the investigation of any possible war crime ... whether they are war crimes committed by Israelis or by Palestinians,” Chile’s foreign minister, Alberto van Klaveren, told reporters in Santiago.
Any proceedings by the ICC would be separate from South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide at the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ).
Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognise its jurisdiction.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has urged Iran and Pakistan to “exercise maximum restraint to avoid a further escalation of tensions” after an exchange of military strikes between the countries.
Pakistan launched retaliatory strikes against militants in Iran on Thursday in response to attacks by Tehran that targeted sites within Pakistan’s borders.
Stéphane Dujarric, the UN chief’s spokesperson, said in a statement:
The secretary general underlines that all security concerns between the two countries must be addressed by peaceful means, through dialogue and cooperation, in accordance with the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and good neighborly relations.
A UN rights expert has said that Israel has broken international law with its “relentless” bombardment of Gaza that has levelled neighbourhoods and collapsed the territory’s healthcare system.
Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, said at a Madrid news conference on Thursday:
Israel has done a number of things that are highly illegal, highly unlawful.
She said that while Israel has the right to self-defence, international humanitarian law must be respected “to protect people who are not actively involved in combat,” AFP reported.
Albanese said she “firmly condemned” the violence carried out by Hamas in Israel – which she said amounted to war crimes and may also be crimes against humanity –but “nothing justifies what Israel has done”. She said:
What has happened is over 100 days of relentless bombing – the first two weeks using 6,000 bombs per week, bombs of 2,000 pounds, in highly crowded area.
Most hospitals in Gaza had been made “dysfunctional”, she said, adding that most Palestinians are dying now “not because of the bombs but because there is not sufficient infrastructure to cure them of wounds.” Albanese added:
The number of kids who get amputated every day is shocking, one or two limbs. During the first two months of this (war) 1,000 kids were amputated without anaesthesia. It is a monstrosity.
The Houthis have claimed they fired “naval missiles” at a US ship, Chem Ranger, in the Gulf of Aden on Thursday.
The attack resulted in “direct hits”, a statement from the Houthi group said, adding:
The Yemeni Armed Forces confirm that a retaliation to the American and British attacks is inevitable, and that any new aggression will not go unpunished.
Here’s some more detail on the reports of an incident earlier today near Aden in Yemen.
The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said it received a report of an incident 115 nautical miles south-east of Aden.
An update from UKMTO said the master reported an unidentified drone “in close proximity” to a merchant vessel and explosion in the water about 30 metres off the port side.
It said coalition forces were responding, and that the vessel and its crew are safe. The vessel is proceeding to the next port, it said.
UKMTO WARNING 015/JAN/2024INCIDENT 017 – ATTACK UPDATE 001https://t.co/qlApy9q9pq#MaritimeSecurity #MarSec pic.twitter.com/ItBfdWXHLW
British maritime security firm Ambrey said a Marshall Islands-flagged chemical/products tanker reported a “suspicious approach” of drones, 103 miles south-east of Aden. An advisory note reads:
One (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) UAV dropped into the sea approximately 30 metres aft ... an Indian warship responded to the event.
Here are some of the latest images we have received over the newswires from Gaza, Israel and the occupied West Bank.
Israeli forces have destroyed the main campus of Al-Israa university in the south of Gaza City, the university said.
Footage circulating on social media appeared to show the complex of buildings being blown up in what appeared to be a controlled explosion, engulfing it in smoke. It was unclear when the explosion took place, AP reported.
In a statement, the university said its main building for graduate studies and bachelor’s colleges were destroyed. It said Israeli forces had seized the complex 70 days ago and used it as a base.
The family of the youngest hostage held by Hamas in Gaza gathered in Tel Aviv on Thursday to mark “the saddest birthday in the world”.
Kfir Bibas, who turned one on Thursday, was kidnapped by Hamas militants from the kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel alongside his parents, Yarden and Shiri, and his four-year-old brother Ariel. It is not clear whether Kfir and his family are still alive.
A large crowd filled the Hostages Square in the Israeli capital, many holding orange balloons in acknowledgment of Kfir’s red hair, the Jerusalem Post reported. Near them a large screen displayed the number of days the hostages have been held in Gaza – 103.
Shiri Bibas’ cousin, Yifat Zeiler, said at the ceremony:
No abductee should celebrate a birthday in captivity. We thank the children and their families for such a moving gesture, and ask the decision-makers to read these wishes to understand that behind every hostage there is a whole world.

"Netanyahu defies Biden, insisting there’s ‘no space’ for Palestinian state",2024-01-20,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/20/netanyahu-defies-biden-insisting-theres-no-space-for-palestinian-state,"The Israeli leader is under pressure over course of the Gaza war but is doubling down on opposition to a two-state solution
Defiant Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu doubled down on opposition to Palestinian statehood, deepening the divide with Israel’s closest international allies, as cracks in his wartime “unity” government became increasingly evident.
Anger with Netanyahu is also increasingly visible on the streets, even though there is broad public support for the war. On Saturday, protesters gathered in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Caesarea and Kfar Saba, some calling for bolder action to secure the release of hostages, and others demanding the prime minister step down.
One in Jerusalem held a placard that read: “Mothers’ cry: we will not sacrifice our children in the war to save the rightwing.”
Over the weekend, Netanyahu sparred publicly – if indirectly – with US President Joe Biden, who for months has offered Israel almost unconditional support for its war in Gaza, at considerable political cost to his own administration, both in America and beyond.
Netanyahu’s spokesman claimed that in a phone call with Biden, the Israeli leader told the US president that his country’s security needs left no space for a sovereign Palestinian state.
“In his conversation with President Biden, prime minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that, after Hamas is destroyed, Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty,” a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office said.
It was a barely veiled shot at Biden, who just hours earlier had said the same conversation left him confident an independent Palestine was feasible when Netanyahu was in power.
The two men had spoken for the first time in nearly a month after Netanyahu alarmed his allies by ruling out an independent Palestinian state in a press conference.
He said even after fighting ends in Gaza, Israel would need to keep security control of all land west of the River Jordan. “That’s a necessary condition. It clashes with the principle of sovereignty but what can you do.”
In London, the shadow foreign secretary David Lammy was strongly critical of Netanyahu. “The Israeli prime minister’s rejection of a Palestinian state is morally wrong. Practically wrong. And against the interests of all people, Palestinian and Israeli,” Lammy said in a speech to the Fabian Society conference, during which he was interrupted by pro-Palestinian demonstrators.
Lammy added: “The peaceful quest for a Palestinian state is a just cause. As Keir Starmer has said, it is the undeniable right of the Palestinian people, and the only path to guarantee a just and lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians.”
A British government spokesman described Netanyahu’s comments as “disappointing”. “The UK’s position is very clear. A two-state solution, with a viable and sovereign Palestinian state living alongside a safe and secure Israel, is the best route to lasting peace.”
The US has repeatedly said that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is the only path to rebuilding Gaza and ensuring Israel’s long-term security.
Critics said the dispute proved a useful distraction from growing domestic tension about the limited achievements of Israel’s campaign in Gaza over three months into the war, the suffering of more than 100 Israelis still held hostage by Hamas, and the lack of a long-term plan for governing the enclave.
“This war has no purpose and no future, but prolonging it is [Netanyahu’s] way of postponing engagement with the question of responsibility,” the Haaretz newspaper quoted a cabinet member saying.
“As long as the protest [movement] is dealing with the hostages’ return, the protest that he fears, against the government, is delayed.”
After more than three months, Israeli attacks have killed nearly 25,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, displaced nearly 2 million people and reduced much of Gaza to ruins. Hunger and disease stalk crowded camps and shelters.
Yet Israeli forces have yet to capture or kill any of the group’s leaders inside Gaza, and Hamas recently launched a barrage of rockets from northern Gaza, where Israel had said the group’s fighting ability had largely been destroyed.
Israel has had more success beyond Israel’s borders; one top official, Saleh al Arouri, was assassinated by a drone strike in Beirut in early January. A senior Hezbollah leader was killed soon after.
On Saturday, a strike in the Syrian capital, Damascus, also killed five Iranian military advisers, destroying a building in a tightly guarded neighbourhood, and a second attack in southern Lebanon killed two people, local media reported.
The Israeli public broadly supports the war. Less than a month ago, polls from the Israeli Institute of Democracy showed that three-quarters of Jewish Israelis opposed the US demand to shift to a less intense phase of the war in Gaza.
But they are increasingly frustrated with Netanyahu’s leadership. Critics include a member of Netanyahu’s own war cabinet, Gadi Eisenkot, a former chief of the Israeli military whose views carry particular moral authority because his 25-year-old son was killed fighting in Gaza.
Eisenkot broke ranks this week to say “total victory” over Hamas was not likely and only a ceasefire deal could bring hostages home. When asked if Netanyahu might be prolonging the war for political gain, he paused before replying: “I hope not.”
Official investigations into military and security failures in the run-up to the Hamas 7 October attacks, which are currently on hold pending the end of the intense phase of fighting, are likely to be very uncomfortable for Netanyahu. He also faces several long-running corruption cases.
Eisenkot is widely believed to be aligned in his views with Benny Gantz, another former general and defence minister on the five-member war cabinet. Netanyahu, his current defence minister Yoav Gallant and strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer are the other members, and want to keep on fighting.
Netanyahu’s coalition government includes far-right parties who are adamantly opposed to a Palestinian state, or any let-up in the intensity of the attacks on Gaza.
The concessions needed to secure the release of hostages, including freeing many Palestinian prisoners, would probably prompt them to leave, and collapse his government.
There was a consensus after 7 October that Israel could not waste energy going to the polls when it needed to focus on the war. Now, most of Israel expects elections this year; the question is how soon, and what will finally splinter the unity government.
Most polling shows Netanyahu’s government would lose power to an opposition coalition if voters turned out in Israel today. But Channel 14 has repeatedly found Netanyahu would only lose a handful of seats, and might be able to cling to power.

Three dead after being pulled from water off Phillip Island – as it happened,2024-01-24,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/jan/24/australia-news-live-cyclone-kirrily-scott-morrison-stage-caucus-meeting-tax-cuts-anthony-albanese-heatwaves,"This blog is now closed.
And with that, we are going to put the blog to bed. Before we go, let’s recap the big headlines:
Labor MPs have unanimously endorsed changes to stage-three tax cuts, which the Coalition has vowed to repeal if elected.
Cyclone Kirrily is expected to start hitting the Queensland coast between Cardwell and Bowen this evening, the Bureau of Meteorology says.
Heatwave conditions are set to persist for large swathes of the country with a cool change not expected until later in the week.
The Woolworths CEO, Brad Banducci, says the company’s decision not to stock Australia Day merchandise could have been better explained.

The former Qantas boss Alan Joyce has stepped down as the Sydney Theatre Company chair.
The former TV host Andrew O’Keefe has avoided jail despite being found guilty of “violent and degrading” domestic attacks.
And Scott Morrison’s next job has been announced: the former prime minister is joining international advisory and consulting firm American Global Strategies.

Auditor general criticises budget blowout in parliamentary IT system
The auditor general has criticised a “significant increase to costs and multiple delays” in the federal government’s build of an expenses management system for parliamentary expenses, where the original budget blew out by nearly double.
The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) today released its performance audit of the Parliamentary Expenses Management System (PEMS), a much-maligned online system where politicians and staff lodge their travel and office bills.
The special minister of state, Don Farrell, said in a statement the system had “never functioned as intended”.
“Mismanaged since the former Government introduced it in 2018, this is one of the most embarrassing IT bungles in history,” he said.
The ANAO report found the budget to build the system had blown out to $74.3m as of June 2023, compared to the original budget of $38.1m. It said the Department of Finance was only “partly effective in implementing the PEMS project”, noting that progress reports from the department did not “support sufficient actions or decisions to keep the project on track”.
Many MPs and staff hugely dislike the system, which has been described by some as clunky and frustrating to use. The ANAO report says the system’s current capability “does not meet all deliverables as agreed in the business case”.
“There is a reliance on manual workarounds particularly for payroll services. Reporting functionality to meet legislative requirements was delayed. Parliamentarians and their staff were not sufficiently consulted throughout the project implementation to ensure the system was simple and easy to use,” the report said.
Farrell said he expected the finance department would address the recommendations of the ANAO report, which included calls for future projects to have better defined scope, deliverables and approaches.
Three people have died and one woman is in a critical condition after being pulled from the water on Phillip Island in Victoria.
Police said emergency services responded to reports of the four people struggling in the water at Newhaven at about 3.30pm and found the four people unresponsive.
First responders administered CPR to the four people, but a man in his 40s and two women in their 20s were pronounced dead at the scene. The woman who is in a critical condition, and is believed to be in her 20s, was airlifted to the Alfred hospital.
Police are not treating the incident as suspicious and will prepare a report for the coroner.
Tropical Cyclone Kirrily is expected to impact the Queensland coast between Cardwell and Bowen from this evening, the Bureau of Meteorology have announced. Here’s the details:
Tropical Cyclone Kirrily has developed in the Coral Sea and is expected to continue strengthening as it tracks west south-west towards the Queensland coast.
A coastal crossing is likely on Thursday evening between Cardwell and Bowen.
After Kirrily crosses the coast, it is expected to quickly weaken to a tropical low, moving further inland and then west south-west across central Queensland. This will bring heavy to intense rainfall to areas across northern interior and western Queensland during Friday and into the weekend.
Queensland communities are advised to stay up to date with forecasts and warnings.
There is up-to-date information on the BoM’s site.

Government should mandate definition of added sugars, researchers say
Australia’s food regulators need to develop a definition of added sugars in processed foods to stop Australians being deceived by misleading advertising, according to new research from UNSW’s George Institute for Global Health.
The research, published today in Current Developments in Nutrition, says that tighter restrictions on the voluntary “no added sugar” claim which Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) introduced in December is a good step, but still allows the food industry to exploit loopholes.
The authors give the example of processed fruit and vegetable sugars in the form of pastes, powders, pulps and purees, which undergo intensive heating and compression which removes the nutritional value in the original fruits or vegetables – such as fibre and water – and leave only concentrated sugars.
Under the new rule, a rolled fruit strap can no longer claim to have “no added sugar” – but can still claim to be “100% fruit’ or ‘made from real fruit”, suggesting it is as healthy as the whole fruit.
The research found around 60% of the Australian food supply contained added sugars of some kind. The paper calls on the government to do more to mandate Australia’s food regulators develop a comprehensive definition.
Dr Alexandra Jones, the senior author of the paper, said :
“Without a comprehensive definition of added sugars in Australia, we are paving the way for highly processed, concentrated fruit and vegetable sugars to remain ‘hidden’ in foods that can still be presented by the food industry as ‘healthy’.”
The Labor caucus meeting has concluded in a bit over an hour and a quarter, with Labor MPs voting unanimously to endorse the changes to the stage-three tax cuts. A short meeting is a good meeting – and we’ve heard from three MPs who have described the tone variously as “positive” and one who went as far as “euphoric”.
The meeting confirmed the parameters of the changes:
Decreasing the lowest rate of tax from 19% to 16%, which will now be paid by those earning above $19,000; and;
Retaining the 37% tax rate for those earning $135,000 to $190,000.
There were many contributions from the floor and a few members who queried how Labor should sell the changes and deal with accusations of a broken promise. We’re told this included some Western Australian MPs.
But there was no major dissent or rejection of the plan - which one Labor MP attributed to the plan being presented as a fait accompli.
There were no big new measures announced that hadn’t been reported in some form before the meeting, which makes sense – the extra cuts for 80% of low and middle income earners is reasonably expensive, and the changes to stage three were designed to be budget-neutral. However, other cost of living measures are in the works.
On the way out, Graham Perrett, the member for Moreton, said Labor would let Peter Dutton defend tax cuts to the rich, which is the attack line Julian Hill gave on the way in.
One MP told Guardian Australia the stage three revamp is the “moral” choice but “maybe not the correct political one”, although it’s not clear yet how the electorate will respond to breach of “repeated promises”.

Workers’ union welcome stage three tax cut changes
The United Workers Union has welcomed the proposed Labor changes to Scott Morrison’s stage-three tax cuts, saying the flagged changes go some way to address massive inequalities in the original proposal. UWU’s national secretary, Tim Kennedy, said:
It was always offensive telling cleaners on $24.07 an hour – or $47,000 for a full-time job – that workers paid above $120,000 deserve $189bn in tax cuts. The Morrison tax cuts are an unwanted legacy of the Coalition’s appalling ‘lifters and leaners’ era that did not live up to the Australian ideal of giving people a fair go and did not pass any sort of pub test.
In a cost-of-living crisis, it’s not the high-income earners on their European holidays who are suffering. The fact the business community is out in force today vocally defending the rights of Australia’s top 14% income earners to billions of dollars in tax cuts tells you a lot about their priorities – and those priorities are certainly not their workers.
Measles exposure sites listed in Melbourne
A new case of measles has also been identified in a returned overseas traveller who attended a number of exposure sites in Melbourne from 17 January 2024 while infectious.
Victoria Health is asking people who have attended the listed exposure sites during the specified dates and times should monitor for symptoms of measles.
There are four sites listed around Frankston and Box Hill – you can find them here.
NSW Health issues measles alert for Sydney airport and Canberra coach
NSW Health is advising people to be alert for signs and symptoms of measles after being notified one case in the ACT was infectious while transiting through Sydney.
The case is an adult who recently returned from Asia where there have been ongoing outbreaks of measles in several countries including Pakistan and India.
People who may have been exposed to the virus in the following locations should monitor for symptoms:
Air India flight AI 302 from Delhi to Sydney, arriving in Sydney on Saturday 20 January at 8.10am.
Sydney airport – Terminal 1 international arrivals (including baggage claim and customs) and Bay 9, bus and coach bays, on the morning of Saturday 20 January
Murrays Sydney to Canberra express bus, departing Sydney international airport around 10.30am on Saturday 20 January. ACT Health is contacting individuals who travelled on this bus service.
The director of the communicable diseases branch of NSW Health, Dr Christine Selvey, said while these locations pose no ongoing risk, if you, or someone you know, were on this flight or visited the above locations at those times it is important to be on the lookout for symptoms:
Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, sore eyes and a cough, usually followed three or four days later by a red, blotchy rash that spreads from the head to the rest of the body.
Earlier, Mike Bowers snapped some of the Labor MPs as they arrived for the caucus meeting:
The Labor caucus is meeting now to discuss the Albanese government’s economic plan including changes to the stage-three income tax cuts which halve the benefit to high-income earners in favour of bigger cuts for those on low and middle incomes.
Government spinners have rejected labels of this meeting as an “emergency” meeting to deal with the “cost-of-living crisis”. While it’s true that it might be normal to schedule an extra caucus meeting to start a new year or to deal with a major issue, it is not every day the otherwise cautious Albanese government so dramatically changes course and sets out a new agenda for the remainder of this term in parliament, likely to define the contest until election day.
Labor MPs have read about the changes, agreed by cabinet on Tuesday, in the media – although some have noted that being consulted at all is an improvement on the workings of some previous governments.
Low-income earners can expect about an extra $800 on top of stage-three tax cuts; while high-income earners earning $200,000 or more could see their tax cuts halved from $9,000 under the stage-three plan.
As far as the changes themselves, Labor MPs mostly like them. It’s hard to disagree with giving more to low- and middle-income earners. Making a difference to people’s lives when they’re struggling is why these MPs got into politics.
But assessments of how badly the broken promise will play in the electorate vary, so they are apprehensive. Most have said it’s a fight worth having, but they’re under no illusions it will give Peter Dutton a potent issue to campaign on.
One MP told Guardian Australia:
I think in all honesty for my area people are not going to be overly unhappy. There’s more people at the bottom end than there are at the top end. People are really busting their chops to pay bills. I think it will be a bit of relief that people doing tough are going to get some support. How we deal with the broken promise – that’s the political bit, that’s the difficult bit.
In a doorstop at the airport, the Labor MP and left faction convener Julian Hill goaded Dutton to come out and say if he doesn’t support tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners. It’s the reverse wedge that Labor has set up, to use its more generous package to create difficulties for the Coalition.
In caucus I expect a robust discussion about how Labor will sell the changes, without too much criticism of the leadership on the substance because they know the government has finally crossed the Rubicon.
Scorching temperatures to strain power grid in NSW and Queensland
Much of inland Australia has been roasting in recent days, and Wednesday’s been no different.
Oodnadatta in South Australia has reached 47.5C and may warm up a bit more yet. (It’s the home of Australia’s equal hottest temp at 50.7C, recorded in January 1960.)
Queensland’s Birdsville is often that state’s oven, and so it was again today with 47.6C. New South Wales wasn’t far behind with Smithville clocking up 46.4C.
The heatwave is easing a bit for the coming days (with soon-to-be Tropical Cyclone Kirrily helping to cool things in its path), the Bureau of Meteorology predicts.
Prolonged heatwave rolls on for parts of eastern Australia. Power demand has been elevated for some days in Queensland and NSW will join the party on Thursday (and possibly Friday, even with the holiday). (Source: @bom_au) pic.twitter.com/Bfr1ZU8Kum
Queensland recorded its highest electricity use earlier this week, smashing the previous record by almost 10%. The grid there will continue to be strained in coming days, by the looks.
NSW often imports power to meet its needs, and with its northern neighbour still hot, it might also face some supply strains on Thursday and even Friday, the Australian Energy Market Operator says. There are a couple of “lack of reserve” alerts out there, which are signals for suppliers to prepare more electricity if needed, rather than certain shortages.
Still, it’s worth keeping an eye out for calls to reduce power demand in the next day or so if you reside in either state.
Rio Tinto workers die in plane crash in Canada’s remote north
A plane carrying Rio Tinto workers has crashed in northern Canada during a flight to its Diavik diamond mine, killing a number of people on board, the Anglo-Australian resources giant said today.
Rio said in a statement it was working closely with authorities to help determine what went wrong.
No details were released concerning the precise number of deaths, other than there had been multiple casualties.
Rio’s chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, said:
As a company we are absolutely devastated by this news and offering our full support to our people and the community who are grieving today.
The crash occurred near Fort Smith in Canada’s remote Northwest Territories. The diamond mine is located about 200km south of the Arctic Circle.
Greens want stage-three tax changes to go further to fund public services
The Greens have responded to Labor’s plan to change the stage-three tax cuts, saying the cost-of-living crisis would be better addressed through funding public services.
The acting leader of the Greens, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, says:
Rich people don’t need a tax cut. There’s better ways to deal with the cost of living crisis than giving politicians and billionaires $9000 every year and hoping it’ll trickle down.
We’ve waited years for Labor to find some courage to stop these tax cuts for the rich, and now we’re still waiting to see whether their Stage 3.1 will still turbocharge inequality. Politicians and billionaires simply don’t need any more money.
If Labor stopped trying to dress up a stinker of a policy, and actually scrapped tax cuts for the rich entirely, they could invest that money in putting dental and mental health into Medicare, making childcare and education free, and freezing rent for two years until wages catch up.

"Middle East crisis: US and UK impose new sanctions on Houthi leaders; Nasser hospital ‘runs out of food, anaesthetics and painkillers’ – as it happened",2024-01-25,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/25/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-qatar-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-gaza-mediation-obstruction-palestine-hamas-hostages-red-sea-crisis-houthi-rebels-us-military,"At least four senior figures from Houthis subject to asset freezes and travel bans, say reports; Gaza-run health ministry says situation in Khan Younis hospital ‘extremely catastrophic’
The US and UK will impose new sanctions on leaders of the Iran-aligned Houthi group, which will include at least four senior figures being subject to asset freezes and travel bans, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday citing people familiar with the plan.
Senior ministers in the Houthi administration in Yemen would also be sanctioned, with an announcement expected as early as Thursday, reports Reuters citing the news article.
We will update this post with more detail when further information comes in.
It’s 5.03pm in Gaza and Tel Aviv and 6.03pm in Sana’a, Yemen. Here are some of the latest developments:
The US and UK will impose new sanctions on leaders of the Iran-aligned Houthi group, which will include at least four senior figures being subject to asset freezes and travel bans, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday citing people familiar with the plan. Senior ministers in the Houthi administration in Yemen would also be sanctioned, with an announcement expected as early as Thursday.
The targeting of ships linked to Israel will continue until aid reaches the Palestinian people in Gaza, Yemen’s Houthis leader Abdel-Malik al-Houthi said on Thursday in a televised speech. The group’s leader added that the results of the latest US and British escalation would be counterproductive and would not affect “our will and determination”.
The US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Thursday renewed calls for Israel to protect civilians after a deadly strike on a UN shelter in Gaza that brought rare US condemnation. “We have reaffirmed this with the government of Israel and it is my understanding that they are, as is necessary and appropriate, looking into this incident,” Blinken said, without saying at what level discussions took place.
Nasser hospital in Khan Younis has run out of food, anaesthetics and painkillers. “The health and humanitarian situation in the hospital is extremely catastrophic due to the siege by the Israeli occupation forces,” the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said.
Israel’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich on Thursday accused Qatar, a key mediator in efforts to free its hostages, of being “largely responsible” for the 7 October Hamas attack. “One thing is clear: Qatar will not be involved one bit in what happens in Gaza the day after the war,” he said. His comments came after Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was recorded allegedly telling hostages’ families this week that Qatar’s mediation was “problematic” when it came to resolving the hostage crisis.
Qatar accused Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of obstructing mediation efforts in the Gaza war and prioritising his career after a leaked recording allegedly captured him calling the Gulf state “problematic”. Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed al-Ansari, said “we are appalled by the alleged remarks”.
Thomas White, the director of affairs in Gaza for the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), said on Thursday that the situation in Khan Younis, southern Gaza ‘underscores a consistent failure’ to uphold international humanitarian law. He said the “persistent attacks on civilian sites” were “utterly unacceptable and must stop immediately”. White also said that an attack on UN Relief and Works Agency shelter in Gaza housing thousands of displaced people, had killed at least 12 people and injured 75 people, including 15 who were in a critical condition. White said a number of missions to reach the dead and injured were denied, without directly saying the attempts had been blocked by Israel. He said UN teams were only able to reach the site in the evening. Israel has denied responsibility for the attack, in which two tank shells hit an UNRWA training centre.
People were seen fleeing near an aid distribution point in the Zeitoun district of Gaza City on Wednesday as gunfire was heard in the background. The video, shared on social media, showed crowds jostling and rushing, some with animal carts. Many people were seen carrying aid as they ran.
Israel’s military says it is looking into allegations that its forces opened fire on crowds of Palestinians queueing for aid in northern Gaza City, reports Al Jazeera. At least 20 people were killed and 150 injured in the attack at the Kuwait roundabout, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the health ministry said a “massacre” had been carried out on “hungry mouths”. Victims were being treated at al-Shifa hospital, which is out of medical supplies and only has a few doctors working, Qudra said.
An Israeli government spokesperson said they expect the international court of justice (ICJ) to throw out the “spurious” genocide allegations on Friday. The remarks come as the ICJ is to give its highly anticipated verdict on South Africa’s request for an interim ruling in its genocide case against Israel on Friday.
Air raid alarms were sounded in Israel on Thursday, marking the first time in almost four days that projectiles were apparently launched from the Gaza Strip towards the country, reports the Times of Israel. Sirens were activated in the evacuated border community of Netiv Ha’asara, with no reports of injuries or damage.
The Houthis in Yemen should be labelled as a terrorist group by the UK government, a top lawyer told parliament on Thursday. Independent crossbench peer Lord Pannick argued that the actions and ideology of the Iran-backed group warrant its so-called proscription. His comments came after the UK and US conducted their second round of joint strikes on Houthi targets this week after continued attacks on Red Sea shipping.
Lord Cameron, the UK foreign secretary, who is in the Middle East for talks with Israeli leaders and Qatari mediators, has called for an end to the Israeli “bottlenecks” preventing aid reaching Gaza and backed an immediate pause in the fighting. Cameron also met the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in the occupied West Bank, where he discussed his Gaza plan to “move from a pause – to get aid in and hostages out – towards a sustainable ceasefire, leading to a long-term political solution, including a Palestinian state”.
António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said the humanitarian situation in Gaza is “appalling”, with a quarter of the population grappling with catastrophic levels of food insecurity, as he renewed the UN’s plea for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”. “Everyone in Gaza is hungry,” he said.
Israeli strikes have killed at least 50 Palestinians in Khan Younis in the last 24 hours, says Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. Al Jazeera reported that at least three people including two children had been killed by Israeli shelling of the al-Satar al-Gharbi area of Khan Younis.
The Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, said the conflict in Gaza shows the UN and other world bodies have lost their effectiveness and called on Muslim countries and other nations to unite for a new “fair world order”. Reporting from Ankara on Wednesday, where Raisi met his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Al Jazeera journalist Sinem Köseoğlu said Raisi demanded the political and economic isolation of Israel, with the Iranian president saying “cutting the lifelines” would be an effective way of ending “Israel’s oppression and murders”.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society transported a number of injured people to hospital on Thursday morning after Israeli forces targeted an apartment building in Rafah, southern Gaza. At least one person was killed in the strike, which happened at dawn in the Tal as-Sultan neighbourhood, reported Al Jazeera.
The fatal shooting of American-Palestinian teenager, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar while driving a pickup truck in the occupied West Bank was unprovoked, the sole passenger has said, describing apparent Israeli fire hitting the back of the vehicle before it overturned several times on a dirt road.
A 72-year-old Israeli woman held captive by Hamas militants for nearly 50 days has told an Israeli TV channel that she was held at length in a dark, humid tunnel where she met the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar.
Violent clashes overnight were reported in the occupied West Bank as Israeli forces raided the city of Jenin. The local Palestinian militant group, the Jenin Brigades, said its men were engaged in heavy exchanges of fire with the Israeli military, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported, while Al Jazeera wrote that one Palestinian had been arrested. The Qatari broadcaster also cited the Palestinian Wafa news agency as reporting that Israeli forces had destroyed monuments to dead Palestinians and that city streets had been torn up by Israeli bulldozers.
Thousands of Indians have flocked to a recruitment centre in India for jobs as construction workers in Israel, willing to take the risk of going to a country embroiled in a devastating war in Gaza.
The number of antisemitic acts registered in Belgium rose sharply since the Hamas attack against Israel that triggered a war in Gaza, according to figures released on Thursday by Unia, an independent public body fighting discrimination. Unia that said it received 91 reports related to the Israel-Gaza conflict between 7 October and 7 December last year, compared with 57 reports for the whole of 2022.
Irene Shashar, a survivor of the Holocaust, has called on the EU to end antisemitism and help bring peace to the Middle East, in an impassioned speech to MEPs on Thursday.
“It breaks my heart to see my grandchildren growing up in war,” Shashar said, referring to conflict between Israel and Hamas since the 7 October attacks. Her speech to lawmakers during a plenary session in Brussels came as the European parliament marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
The Nazis killed about 6 million Jews during the Holocaust. “I won against Hitler. I am finally home but my grandchildren must now fight for its survival,” Shashar said, as she called for the release of all Israeli hostages from Hamas. You can watch Shashar speak in the video here:
The Houthis in Yemen should be labelled as a terrorist group by the UK government, a top lawyer told parliament on Thursday, reports PA Media.
The independent crossbench peer Lord Pannick argued that the actions and ideology of the Iran-backed group warranted its so-called proscription. His comments came after the UK and US conducted their second round of joint strikes on Houthi targets this week after continued attacks on Red Sea shipping.
The peer is a public law and human rights barrister, and has worked on a number of high-profile cases including those related to Shamima Begum, Gina Miller, Boris Johnson, Max Mosley, the BBC and the British Olympic Committee, and has argued cases before the UK supreme court, the European court of justice and the European court of human rights.
Pannick told the House of Lords:
Following the actions of the Houthis in pursuance of their slogan: ‘Death to America, death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews’, and given the recent protests in this country in support of this appalling organisation, is it not high time for the government to bring before parliament a motion to proscribe this organisation as terrorist group?”
AP reports that the leader of the House of Lords, Lord True, responded: “We are sanctioning members of the Houthi organisation. But I totally agree with his characterisation of the organisation and their nature and I can assure him that all these matters will be kept under careful and constant review.”
The call for the Houthis to be labelled a terrorist group comes a week after the US government announced a similar designation. The US state department said on 17 January that it would designate Ansar Allah, commonly referred to as the Houthis, as a “specially designated global terrorist group” in 30 days’ time.
The targeting of ships linked to Israel will continue until aid reaches the Palestinian people in Gaza, Yemen’s Houthi leader, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, said on Thursday, reports Reuters citing a televised speech.
“Our country will continue its operations until food and medicine reach the people of Gaza,” he said. The group’s leader added that the results of the latest US and British escalation would be counterproductive and would not affect “our will and determination”.
The US and UK will impose new sanctions on leaders of the Iran-aligned Houthi group, which will include at least four senior figures being subject to asset freezes and travel bans, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday citing people familiar with the plan.

The US secretary of state on Thursday renewed calls for Israel to protect civilians after a deadly strike on a UN shelter in Gaza that brought rare US condemnation.
Two tank shells struck the UN shelter on Wednesday in Gaza’s main southern city of Khan Younis, killing 12 people, according to the UN. On a visit to Angola, Antony Blinken told reporters that the UN shelter was “essential and it has to be protected”, AFP reports.
“We have reaffirmed this with the government of Israel and it is my understanding that they are, as is necessary and appropriate, looking into this incident,” Blinken said, without saying at what level discussions took place.
The Israeli army is the only force known to have tanks operating in the Gaza Strip. It said it would conduct a thorough review and held out the possibility that the strike was a result of Hamas fire.
In contrast with Israel’s frequent criticism of UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Blinken credited the agency for its efforts “to help people who are in desperate need”.
“The work that the UN is performing in Gaza is quite literally life-saving and no one else can do it – and no one else is doing it,” he said.
Thousands of people have flocked to a recruitment centre in India for jobs as construction workers in Israel, willing to take the risk of going to a country embroiled in a devastating war in Gaza.
Jobs are hard to find in India and many of the men who were waiting for a job interview on Thursday said they could earn about $1,600 (£1,260) a month in Israel, roughly four times what they would get paid in India, if they could find a job, AFP reports.
The states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have each advertised for about 10,000 positions for skilled construction workers in Israel.
Here are some of the latest images coming out of Gaza, Israel and elsewhere on the news wires today:
An Israeli government spokesperson said they expect the international court of justice (ICJ) to throw out the “spurious” genocide allegations on Friday, Reuters reports.
The remarks come as the ICJ is de to give its highly anticipated verdict on South Africa’s request for an interim ruling in its genocide case against Israel on Friday.
The ruling, if granted, would probably take the form of an order to Israel to announce a ceasefire in Gaza and allow more UN humanitarian aid into the country.
Read more on the interim ruling here:
People were seen fleeing near an aid distribution point in the Zeitoun district of Gaza City on Wednesday as gunfire was heard in the background.
The video, shared on social media, showed crowds jostling and rushing, some with animal carts. Many people were seen carrying aid as they ran.
On Tuesday, the World Food Programme said very little food aid had made it beyond southern Gaza since the start of the conflict with Israel, and pockets of the Palestinian enclave remained at risk of famine. An Israeli government spokesperson said there were “no limitations on the admission of humanitarian aid”.
Israel’s military says it is looking into allegations that its forces opened fire on crowds of Palestinians queueing for aid in northern Gaza City, reports Al Jazeera.
At least 20 people were killed and 150 injured in the attack, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. A spokesperson for the health ministry said an attack had been carried out on “hungry mouths”.
“The Israeli occupation committed a new massacre against thousands of hungry mouths who were waiting for aid,” Ashraf al-Qudra said, reports Al Jazeera citing a statement on Telegram.
He said the attack occurred at the Kuwait roundabout in Gaza City and that the number of dead was likely to rise because of serious injuries suffered by dozens of the injured. The victims were being treated at al-Shifa hospital, which is out of medical supplies and only has a few doctors working, Qudra said.
Air raid alarms were sounded in Israel on Thursday, marking the first time in almost four days that projectiles were apparently launched from the Gaza Strip towards the country, reports the Times of Israel.
The publication said sirens were activated in the evacuated border community of Netiv Ha’asara, with no reports of injuries or damage. The previous alerts near Gaza had sounded on Sunday afternoon.

‘Ukraine fatigue’: why I’m fighting to stop the world forgetting us,2024-01-25,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/ukraine-fatigue-why-im-fighting-to-stop-the-world-forgetting-us,"Everyone likes to support an underdog, especially if it’s winning. But it’s one thing to win a battle, it’s quite another to win the war. And Ukraine cannot win without international support
‘If you were 30% braver, what would you do to be a better ancestor?” the enthusiastic host asked a roomful of delegates in New York, gathered for a conference on democracy. “Take 60 seconds to think and share your answers in your small groups.”
My small group consisted of seasoned activists from different parts of the world. They were eager to discuss their opinions on courage and legacy. “I’d spend more time with my kids,” said one. “I would speak to people I disagree with more often,” said another. I kept quiet hoping no one would notice.
“You’re being quiet,” said one of them when everyone else had spoken. My group turned to me.
“Oh, I don’t know. It’s a difficult question.” I tried to get myself out of the trap. “I need more time to think about it.”
The thing is, I didn’t need time to think about it. As soon as the facilitator finished her question, my answer was right there, staring me in the face. Now that my small group was staring at me just as insistently, I couldn’t face sharing my thoughts with them. It seemed like I needed to be 30% braver just to utter the answer.
“If I were braver, to be a better ancestor, I’d join the army. The Ukrainian armed forces.”
At that moment, it was the only answer that rang true.
My response was met with the sort of uncomfortable silence I seem to bring to most social conversations. A friend has found a good term for that: a Ukrainian killjoy. It applies to those of us who keep talking about the war when people want to talk about their kids, the future and all those wonderful things that give us hope. Sometimes, we don’t even need to offer a digest of Russia’s recent bombardments, we end conversations just by entering the room.
When people think of Ukraine these days, they think of war, destruction, death, weapons, the need to produce and provide more weapons. Such thoughts bring little inspiration. And so, when asked to talk about Ukraine on international platforms, I am frequently encouraged to speak of peace, reconstruction and reconciliation. A relentless fight with no end in sight is a conversation killer. It’s also a reality in which most Ukrainians have been living since the start of the full-scale war.
Throughout history, Ukraine has been regarded as merely a buffer zone between Europe proper and the threat from the east. A stateless nation, it was denied a voice on international platforms for centuries. Despite successfully restoring its sovereignty in 1991, distrust persisted among states inclined to reserve decision-making seats exclusively for those deemed “great powers”, a designation that is frequently acquired through the imperialist oppression of other nations.
Ukraine experts have tried to shift the narrative to show the country as the gates of Europe, the crossroads of cultures, the bridge facilitating conversation among unlikely interlocutors in a multitude of tongues. For the outside world, however, Ukraine has remained a buffer zone lacking a clear identity – a territory that can be fought over, sacrificed or simply overlooked.
In 2022, after Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine offered the world a new narrative about itself: it was no longer perceived as a nation of leather-jacketed riffraff from the edge of Europe, ruled by dodgy oligarchs with large wallets and poor taste. It was a new incarnation of brave David unafraid of monstrous Goliath. The narrative caught on – because who doesn’t like a good remake of an old story?
For as long as they could, throughout 2022, Ukrainians kept this image up. After the liberation of the Kyiv region and the sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, the Ukrainian armed forces successfully freed the Kharkiv region and then proceeded to liberate Kherson. Each time, they uncovered mass graves, torture chambers, death and devastation. They were greeted by people whose gratitude for liberation was as great as the grief that had been brought by the occupiers.
The Ukrainian army was conducting successful campaigns, and countless observers the world over conveniently forgot that, back in February 2022, they had given this same army no more than a week. Fortune favours the brave, and so do the western partners. Success at the front persuaded even reluctant nations such as Germany to deliver assistance to Ukraine. Everyone likes to support an underdog, especially if it’s winning. But it’s one thing to win a battle (or several), it’s quite another to win the war.
Ukraine was never given enough support to win. The assistance it received was vital to survive, crucial to keep going, necessary not to lose. It wasn’t sufficient to win. It turned out that one thing that was truly in short supply was courage. Not that of the people of Ukraine – they had no choice but to be brave. It was the leaders of what is known as the free world who needed to be braver to put an end to this war. A real end. Not a temporary ceasefire, which territorial concessions might bring, not a stalemate in a war of attrition. The sort of end that could only come with Ukraine’s victory, which would include the restoration of territorial integrity violated by Russia in 2014 when it occupied Crimea, the dispensation of justice for the numerous crimes committed by the Russian troops and their leadership, and the provision of the type of security guarantees that would make a new wave of Russian aggression impossible.
For much of 2023, the eyes of the world were still on Ukraine, but this attention was that of a streaming TV addict, flicking through the fresh releases, looking for a new series to binge on. The release of the 2023 season of Russia’s war, branded as “Ukraine’s counteroffensive”, was delayed. And then something more gripping came along.
In early October, I was in Ukraine at the Lviv Book Forum, a literary festival. It was co-organised with the Hay festival, and thus attracted a good number of international journalists. On the morning of 7 October I met several of them rushing through the hotel lobby, bags packed, taxis waiting to take them back to the Polish border. They were off to the Middle East.
I started to get requests for comment from papers around the world, asking me to share how it felt to compete for attention with the Israel-Gaza war. I did not wish to partake in a competition of human suffering orchestrated by the media and exacerbated by our ever-shortening attention span. For people caught in the violence, be it in Palestine, Israel or Ukraine, this was no TV series. It was their lives on display: blood, sweat and tears. But I had to admit that the Ukraine fatigue we’d been afraid of since the start of the all-out war had descended in earnest. Outside the country, there was less and less investment in Ukraine’s victory.
“You need to change your tune, you know. People don’t take this victory rhetoric seriously any more,” said a man at a Christmas party, as 2023 drew to an end. I tried to convince myself he meant well.
“How should I fight this Ukraine fatigue here in London while my compatriots fight the Russian missiles at home?” I asked.
“I don’t know, but the whole victory thing isn’t working, because we’ve given you everything and you still haven’t won.”
I gasped for air and told him that we’ve also given everything and then some. I told him that earlier that night, just before heading out to the party, I had phoned my mother. She told me that a distant cousin who had been fighting at the front had been killed. She had spoken to our relatives who had been to his funeral.
“They only buried his legs, you know,” mum said on the phone. “Couldn’t find any other parts after the blast. His comrades recognised his legs because he had distinct tattoos.”
It’s good that I also have a tattoo, I thought. Who knows? Just in case. I didn’t say that to my mum. Instead, I said: “That’s awful. At least we could bury the whole of Volodya.”
Volodya, my brother, was killed in action in 2017. That was before the world discovered Ukraine. It was when leaders of the free world still shook Putin’s hand, bought Russian oil and enabled the aggressor to prepare for the inevitable escalation. My brother was killed in Luhansk region, near Popasna, when Popasna was still standing. Now, if you look at the aerial images of that city, you can see only ruins. Remnants of cities are like remnants of people, hard to recognise.
“I guess we were lucky. We didn’t need to look for tattoos to recognise Volodya’s body,” I said to my mum. She agreed. Ukrainian luck.
Not long ago, a friend of mine told me something she’d heard from a British acquaintance: “You don’t even realise how lucky you are to live in London!” My friend is from southern Ukraine, from a city that gets shelled almost daily. After months under Russian bombardment, she decided to leave a job she loved, her ageing parents, the life she’d been building in a city she adored, and seek refuge in the UK.
“Did they mean that you’re lucky to have escaped the war zone alive?” I ask her to clarify, although I suspect that that is not what they meant.
“No! They meant that I’m lucky because my host family lives in a posh bit of London, and I can enjoy all the opportunities that this city has to offer.”
Ah yes, those plentiful opportunities refugees enjoy. Like many displaced Ukrainians – not to mention refugees from other parts of the world – she struggles to make ends meet.
To cheer her up, I told her that, a couple of days earlier, a man sitting next to me at a conference dinner in a northern European capital had said to me: “Your life must be so exciting! Whizzing around the world, giving talks! Hundreds of people listening to you, wanting to know about Ukraine!”
She asked me if I told the guy to get lost. I didn’t. I told him that I’d rather have my brother alive and my homeland at peace than all this excitement. I’d rather people learned about my country in universities and bookshops. Although, in truth, that is not easy. There is still a gaping hole in university curriculums when it comes to the study of Ukraine. In Britain, there is a handful of places where Ukrainian history, politics and culture are taught, only two universities that have Ukrainian programmes and only one that offers a degree in Ukrainian Studies.
When it comes to bookshops, some now stock works on Ukraine, but the bulk of them are focused on the war rather than the country as a whole, and most are written by observers who are not ordinarily based in Ukraine. The voices from inside the country are not being promoted. And to add insult to injury, there are also bookshops that insist on shelving Ukrainian books in the “Russian literature” section. On my recent trip to Paris, I saw my book sitting uncomfortably among the Russian tomes, and insisted it be moved to a more appropriate place. The manager replied that he didn’t have enough Ukrainian books to create a Ukraine shelf. When I explained that the only connection my book had to Russia was that its protagonist had been killed by that country’s army, the manager responded that they didn’t think of the Russia shelf as relating to the country, but more as representing a region. And what region might that be: the Russian empire? The manager did not dignify me with an answer. He snapped the book out of the Russian shelf and shoved it on a temporary “new editions” table.
Perhaps rather than feeling enraged by the experience, however, I should have felt lucky: if it wasn’t for the war, my book might not have made it to the bookshops at all. There are countless blessings I remember each day. Here in London, I don’t have to hide in bomb shelters from Russian drones and missiles. I don’t have to spend the winter with no electricity like my fellow countrywomen and men do as Russia tries to freeze Ukraine into submission. Having said that, I start my day by checking the news and texting my loved ones in Ukraine to see if they made it through the night. Every day, I hear of another death of someone two handshakes away. On a bad day, it’s someone I knew or worked with, someone whose poetry I had been reading the day before.
My calendar is marked with morbid anniversaries: in 2024, Ukrainians commemorate two years since the full-scale invasion and 10 years since the start of the war. When I marked birthdays last year, I started by saying: “He would have turned 49; she would have been 38.” My grief is immense, as is that of all my compatriots: about 80% of Ukrainians know someone who was either killed or injured in this war. In this context, my fellow Europeans highlighting my good fortune is no more than a tiresome nuisance. I realise my luck. They are yet to acknowledge theirs.
‘Why don’t you join the Ukrainian army? You speak so passionately about your people’s fight and your brother’s service. Wouldn’t you want to join the ranks yourself?” The first time a journalist asked me this question was in front of a few hundred people at a literary festival. I felt a hot wave of blood rushing through my body and had to compose myself before I could answer. We had just been discussing my book about my brother’s death on the frontline. Did he really think that that was an appropriate question to ask? Didn’t he think that visiting one war grave is enough for one family? I searched for answers, but they were all flawed.
I don’t join up because I am not trained for army service; I have no useful skills to offer. But nor do many recruits who volunteered or were mobilised for service. I don’t join up because my contribution to the war effort is to write and speak to people all over the world to raise awareness about this war and galvanise support for Ukraine. But so could many Ukrainian writers, artists, poets and people of different professions who Russia’s invasion turned into soldiers. My gender is no reason to avoid service either. Thousands of women are fighting the external enemy and the internal obstacles put in front of them by the remnants of paternalistic culture. Why don’t I join up, indeed?
The answer I gave was true: I’m not in the Ukrainian armed forces simply because I am privileged not to have to join up. I live in London. I live in a state whose sky is protected by air defence and international alliances. Whose voice on the global stage is not doubted. The citizens of my adopted country, unlike those of my country of birth, are lucky not to have to be brave. Like them, I have the luxury of choice and I choose to be safe. For now.
This will be a year of choices. Billions of people in dozens of countries will go to the polls and exercise the right to make their voices heard. Of course, not every election serves as a genuine expression of people’s will, and there are also those nations where many either take their right to vote for granted because they never had to fight for it, or feel so disenfranchised that they don’t think their vote matters. In 2024, wherever we are in the world, we can’t afford to have our choices made for us. We are obliged to exercise our agency, however limited it might seem.
We have the power to elect political representatives who can enact changes that will outlast their time in office. We need to support politicians who view Russia’s war not as an inconvenience to their economies, but understand that tolerance of a warmongering state is what led us to this situation in the first place. We need to hold accountable those leaders who allowed Russia to enjoy impunity after 2014, who benefited from continued business with the aggressor country and thus contributed to the escalation in 2022.
Crucially, we must wake up from the slumber of inaction: this war is existential not only for Ukrainians; it is existential for those of us who want to live in a world governed not by brutal force, but by the rule of law. If we don’t win the fight for democracy in Ukraine, we’ll end up fighting for it closer to home. Let us then do all in our power to help Ukrainians win the fight not only for their freedom, but also for ours.
“For our freedom and yours” is a famous slogan in east-central Europe. It originates in 19th-century Poland, a state that had been partitioned by Russia, Prussia and Austria. The initial banner featured the inscription of this motto in Polish and Russian, highlighting the Polish anti-imperial insurrectionists’ support for the anti-Tsarist Decembrists’ revolt.
The Polish nation, which gave us the slogan, survived even when it was deprived of statehood. The striving for freedom lived on in exile, in the underground, and in the minds and hearts of people who willed their country back into existence after 123 years of statelessness. Poland was restored on the ruins of the imperial powers that had tried to destroy it. Like in the Polish case, the people of Ukraine managed to keep the flame of freedom burning even through the darkest times of Russian and Soviet imperialism. They wrote poetry in Ukrainian in prison cells and published it in underground press. They passed on a clear sense of identity to their youths, like a secret spell that was bound to work its magic sooner or later. Ukrainian statehood is hard-won.
The current existential fight requires the mobilisation of the whole of Ukrainian society, but victory also requires international solidarity. Ukrainians no longer have the privilege to choose whether to be 30% braver. That choice was taken away by Russia. They must be brave in order to survive. The rest of us still have that choice. We had better make it soon.

How South Africa’s genocide case against Israel played out in The Hague,2024-01-26,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/how-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel-played-out-in-the-hague,"Feelings have run high inside and outside court, where two countries with painful histories were pitted against each other
Shortly after 10am local time on 11 January a hush descended over the ornate courtroom at the Peace Palace in The Hague as the judges of the international court of justice entered to hear South Africa’s case alleging genocide by Israel in Gaza.
Outside the court, protesters noisily made their feelings known and more than 3,000km away the bombardment of the Palestinian enclave continued, as the US president of the court, Joan Donoghue, began the formalities, opening the hearing into the war in Gaza.
Once the formalities were dispensed with it was then left to Vusimuzi Madonsela, South Africa’s ambassador to the Netherlands, to open the case, which pitted two countries with painful histories against each other.
The delegations from each side included “some of the lucky ones who managed to get out of Gaza”, and relatives of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas.
The crux of South Africa’s case was that the proof was in the devastation wreaked upon Gaza by Israel in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 in which militants killed about 1,200 Israelis, mainly civilians – plus the now parlous state of the Palestinian enclave, and the words of Israel’s leaders.
The South African lawyer Adila Hassim told the court: “Genocides are never declared in advance but this court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts.”
She cited the death toll in Gaza, then about 23,000 (although it had increased by the time Hassim read it out in court), mostly women and children, as well as the 7,000 people trapped under rubble, presumed dead, the thousands more injured, and 85% of the population being displaced. Then there was the destroyed or damaged infrastructure and ruination of an estimated 355,000 Palestinian homes, the court heard.
The humanitarian crisis bringing starvation and dehydration was well documented by international humanitarian organisations, and was compounded by Israel’s refusal to allow aid into Gaza, the judges heard.
Unlike a definitive ruling on genocide (defined as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”), which would take years to resolve, the application for provisional measures made by South Africa in the hope the ICJ would order a ceasefire, requires only that some of the alleged acts fall within the genocide convention.
Israel, whose response came the following day, claimed that South Africa had failed to do this. Its legal team claimed it was acting in self-defence, only doing what it had to in order to protect its citizens after the 7 October attacks, and that a ceasefire would leave them at the mercy of Hamas, which was dedicated to Israel’s annihilation.
Tal Becker, the Israeli foreign ministry’s legal adviser, called the ceasefire request “unconscionable” saying: “If there were acts of genocide, they have been perpetrated against Israel.”
Becker said that civilian suffering was “sadly” inevitable in warfare but not proof of genocide. Israel blamed Hamas for civilian deaths, both directly and indirectly. It alleged Hamas’s misfiring rockets, booby traps and mines killed Palestinian civilians and its use of human shields and civilian buildings put them in the firing line. Hamas’s tunnel network was blamed for the collapse of buildings.
Israel denied bombing hospitals and said it had gone to “extraordinary efforts” to provide humanitarian assistance, playing footage to the court of aid vehicles crossing into Gaza, and said it gave advance warnings before bombing areas.
South Africa’s legal team highlighted alleged examples of “genocidal intent”, including the reference by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to the Old Testament story in which the Israeli people of King Saul were commanded to destroy all men, women, children and animals of the Amalekite people.
Other statements from current ministers quoted in court included calling Gazans “human animals”, holding them all responsible for the actions of Hamas, and calls for another Nakba (the 1948 displacement of Palestinians from the newly founded state of Israel), or even for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on the enclave.
Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, another South African lawyer, said Israeli soldiers “proved they understood the prime minister’s message” when they were recorded dancing and singing about there being “no uninvolved” and wiping out “the seed of Amalek”.
In response, Prof Malcolm Shaw, representing Israel, said that Netanyahu’s words about Amalek were “partially and misleadingly quoted” and that the prime minister had said, in the same comment, “the IDF does everything to avoid harming the uninvolved”. He said other comments highlighted by South Africa were “clearly rhetorical”, made in the aftermath of the traumatic 7 October attacks, and in no way reflected “official and binding policy”.
In more prosaic submissions Shaw spent considerable time arguing that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction because of procedural mistakes made by South Africa.
At other times the claims were much more incendiary, echoing Israel’s reaction to the launch of the case, when it accused South Africa of a “blood libel” and of cooperating with Hamas.
While the language in court was more tempered, Becker said: “The delegitimisation of Israel since its very establishment in 1948 in the applicant’s submissions, sounded barely distinguishable from Hamas’s own rejectionist rhetoric.” This came after Madonsela referred to “Israel’s colonisation” of Palestine.
Israel also accused South Africa of “making almost no mention” of the suffering of Israelis and treating the hostages held since the 7 October attacks as an “afterthought”, which Madonsela robustly denied on the steps of the Peace Palace.
Feelings were running high outside the court, where supporters of both sides, allocated separate areas by police, waved Palestinian and Israeli flags. Some pro-Palestinian protesters carried baby dolls stained with red, representing blood, while Israeli supporters had empty chairs for the hostages.
On the first day of proceedings the Israeli contingent broadcast images of the hostages on an LED screen, while on the second day Palestinian supporters showed images of Gaza and a documentary about the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement targeting Israel. As they watched proceedings on the screen they shouted “liar, liar” as Becker spoke.
After the hearing, Germany, which, like the US and UK, backs and arms Israel, said it would make a third-party intervention on behalf of its ally, saying that in view of its history – as perpetrator of the Holocaust against Jews – it “sees itself as particularly committed to the genocide convention”. It called the case against Israel “completely unfounded”.
For his part, Netanyahu pledged “total victory” and said “no one will stop us, not The Hague”, amplifying existing doubts about whether any judgment by the ICJ, which lacks enforcement powers, could bring an end to the bloodshed.
In a highly anticipated ruling on Friday, Donoghue granted the application for provisional measures that ordered Israel to ensure its forces did not commit acts of genocide in Gaza but fell short of requiring a ceasefire.
It meant South Africa and the Palestinians could hail a landmark victory but Netanyahu, while railing against the “outrageous charge of genocide”, could welcome the fact a ceasefire “was rightly rejected”. While hopes were expressed that Israel would comply with the order, it remained uncertain that it would do so.

The ICJ ruling could implicate the US in war crimes. Will Biden finally rein in Israel? | Mohamad Bazzi,2024-01-27,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/27/ijc-verdict-israel-gaza-war-biden-pressure,"Biden’s unqualified support for Israel has exposed the US to potential complicity in genocide and global condemnation
The international court of justice on Friday ordered Israel to prevent acts of genocide by its troops in Gaza, and to allow more aid into the besieged territory. The court, which is the UN’s highest judicial body, stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. But it was a victory for the Palestinians, and for the global south in general, in that Israel is being held accountable for its military actions for the first time, and by one of the world’s most important courts.
By allowing the case brought by South Africa to go forward and calling on Israel to comply with the genocide convention – and to report back to the court within a month – the ruling raises the stakes on Israel’s western backers to pressure Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to rein in its devastating invasion and bombardment of Gaza. The ruling is embarrassing to Joe Biden and his top aides, especially the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who described South Africa’s case as “meritless” a few weeks ago.
While it could take years for the court to rule on whether Israel has committed genocide, the interim measures are intended to prevent conditions in Gaza from getting worse while the case makes its way through the tribunal’s process. The US, Britain and other western powers that have backed Israel unconditionally since it launched its assault on Gaza, after Hamas’s 7 October attacks, will presumably want to avoid being implicated in supporting a genocide – and that is incentive for these world powers to finally push for a ceasefire.
The Biden administration is particularly vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy if it decides to ignore the court’s findings, which are binding on its member states. But the court does not have an enforcement mechanism, aside from referring matters to the UN security council, where Washington has already used its veto power multiple times to shield Israel from demands for a ceasefire. Over the past few years, the US and Britain have urged adversaries, especially Russia and Myanmar, to abide by the international court’s rulings.
In November, the US president issued a statement supporting the candidacy of a US law professor, Sarah Cleveland, to join the international court, saying it “remains one of humanity’s most critical institutions to advance peace around the world”. With such a strong endorsement, the US would look duplicitous if it continues to insist that South Africa’s case is baseless, or that the court’s nearly unanimous ruling on Friday somehow should not apply to Israel.
With their unwavering support of Israel, Biden and Blinken also failed to live up to a highly touted promise, made a month after their administration took office in 2021, to put human rights at the center of US foreign policy. The administration said it is “committed to a world in which human rights are protected, their defenders are celebrated, and those who commit human rights abuses are held accountable”.
That pledge faltered even before the Gaza war, when Biden continued the decades-long US policy of providing military aid and diplomatic support to repressive regimes like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, while ignoring their human rights violations and suppression of dissent.
Like previous US presidents, including George W Bush and Barack Obama, who waged or supported foreign wars while dispensing lofty rhetoric about respect for human rights and democracy, Biden’s façade fell apart thanks to his support of Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza. Israel’s war has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians – a majority of them women and children.
According to Oxfam, the daily death toll, averaging 250 per day, has surpassed any other major conflict in the 21st century. The invasion has also unleashed mass hunger and displaced nearly 85% of Gaza’s population, about 1.9 million people. Despite the death toll and humanitarian crisis, the US and other western powers have yet to meaningfully pressure Israel to end its bombardment and accept a ceasefire.
In fact, the Biden administration fell into wishful thinking as it faced the prospect of the Gaza conflict spreading into a wider regional war that would draw in Iran and its allies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and various Shia militias in Iraq and Syria.
Since the Gaza war started, Hezbollah and Israeli forces have engaged in almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border, while the Houthi militia has attacked shipping vessels in the Red Sea – prompting the US and UK to attack dozens of Houthi targets in Yemen over the past two weeks. But even at the risk of an expanding conflict that his administration insists it wants to avoid, Biden has refused to take the most straightforward path to de-escalation across the region: forcing Netanyahu to accept a truce in Gaza.
Biden has significant leverage over the Israeli government. After the 7 October attacks, the US administration requested more than $14bn in funding from Congress for weapons and other military aid to Israel. But instead of using that leverage to end the war, Biden’s administration has gone out of its way to shield US weapons sales and shipments to Israel from public scrutiny and congressional approval.
In November, Biden removed restrictions on Israel’s ability to access a weapons stockpile that the Pentagon has kept in Israel since the 1980s. Then in December, the state department twice invoked emergency provisions that allowed it to send tens of thousands of artillery shells and other munitions to Israel without review by Congress.
Biden’s effort to protect Israel from criticism over heavy civilian casualties and the ways it has conducted its war in Gaza exposed the US not only to international condemnation and charges of hypocrisy, but to potential complicity in war crimes. In December, CNN reported that a US intelligence assessment found that almost half of the bombs that Israel had dropped on Gaza since 7 October were “dumb bombs”, or unguided munitions, which have much higher potential of killing civilians, especially in a densely populated area like Gaza. (Israel has “smart bombs”, but they’re more expensive and harder to secure, so the Israeli military seemed to be holding them back and using the cheaper munitions.)
In arguing their case at the international court, South Africa’s lawyers pointed to Israel’s use of “dumb bombs” and 2,000-pound bunker-buster munitions, which cause huge damage in dense areas, as examples of Israel’s large-scale killing and maiming of civilians. Among the thousands of bombs it rushed to Israel since October, the US has sent at least 100 bunker busters – and Israel has already dropped hundreds of these bombs on Gaza.
Over the past few days – perhaps anticipating the international court’s decision and potential public relations damage – the Biden administration leaked plans to send its CIA director, William Burns, to Europe to meet with Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials. Burns is hoping to revive indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel, for the release of all remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza and a potential ceasefire. There are still many obstacles, especially since Israel has reportedly proposed a 60-day pause in fighting, while Hamas is insisting on a permanent ceasefire and the release of nearly all Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the remaining hostages.
Even though the international court did not grant South Africa’s request for an immediate ceasefire, its ruling could force the hand of the Biden administration and Israel’s other western supporters to finally end the bloodshed in Gaza.

Antony Blinken described the proposal on the table for a new hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas as “strong and compelling”.
The US secretary of state noted “the less said the better” in terms of negotiations on a new hostage deal, but that the work that is being done is “important and hopeful”.
He said Hamas “will have to make its own decisions”, and that it is his “strong assessment” that Israel would “very much like to see this process of hostages coming out”. He added:
I can say that very important, productive work has been done, and there is some real hope going forward.

British foreign secretary David Cameron will travel to Oman on Tuesday where he is expected to call for stability over ongoing Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and de-escalating of tensions in the Middle East, the foreign office has said according to Reuters. The news agency writes:
Cameron, on his fourth visit to the Middle East, will travel to Oman to meet his counterpart Badr Albusaidi to discuss how to diminish tensions across the region.
The Houthi attacks on international shipping lines in the Red Sea will be a major focus of his discussions, the foreign office said in a statement.
Cameron will reiterate Britain’s commitment to getting aid into Yemen, and outline the actions Britain is taking to deter the Houthis from targeting ships in the Red Sea.
In an earlier diplomatic tour, Cameron met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and politicians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the western-backed Palestinian Authority is based, and visited Qatar to discuss the situation in Gaza.
In his meetings in Israel, Cameron said he stressed the need for a pause in fighting to secure the release of hostages seized by Hamas militants during a cross-border attack on 7 October.
As we reported earlier, 215 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the territory’s ministry of health, despite an interim ICJ ruling last week calling on Israel to do all within its power to limit civilian casualties.
Among the dead were six family members of a 6-year-old girl called Hind, who was the only survivor after Israeli forces shot at the car she was in with her family, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS). The dead included four children, the agency said.
In a Twitter post, the PRCS said Hind was trapped in the car and “remained for hours pleading for our teams to reach her and evacuate her from the area surrounded by Israeli tanks.” In a series of posts it continued:
For more than three hours, the PRCS team maintained communication with the 6-year-old girl Hind, soothing her amidst her continuous pleas for evacuation from the vehicle.
Coordination was established through the Palestinian Coordination and Liaison Office with Israeli authorities to dispatch A PRCS ambulance to the location.
Around 6:00 PM, our teams reached the area where Hind was trapped inside the vehicle, which had been shot near the Fares petrol station in Gaza. Since then, we lost contact with the team, and as of now, we are uncertain if our teams successfully reached the girl.
Hind, was with her extended family (her mother’s uncle) when the vehicle was shot. She remained alone inside the vehicle after everyone in it, including the mother, father, and four children tragically lost their lives.
It was not possible to independently verify the account.

The Israeli military says it has carried out airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.
“The targets included Hezbollah’s infrastructure and an observation post located in the southern Lebanese areas of Markaba, Taybeh, and Maroun al-Ras,” the army said in a statement.
The IDF army also confirmed that several projectiles had been launched from Lebanon and said forces “responded by targeting the launch sites and other locations in Lebanon”.
Israel’s army chief Herzi Halevi said earlier this month that the likelihood of war on the northern border has become “much higher”, Agence France-Presse reports.
“I don’t know when the war in the north is, I can tell you that the likelihood of it happening in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past,” Halevi said.
Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Monday that Israeli troops will “very soon go into action” near the country’s northern border with Lebanon. Gallant told troops near the border with the besieged Gaza Strip that others were being deployed to Israel’s north. “They will very soon go into action … so the forces in the north are reinforced,” Gallant said.

Let’s get more on what Qatar’s prime minister sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al Thani has been saying.
He says he hopes US retaliation for an drone attack that killed three US troops in Jordan won’t undercut progress toward a new Israel-Hamas hostage release deal
I hope that nothing would undermine the efforts that we are doing or jeopardise the process
Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al Thani was speaking in front of a Washington thinktank audience and gave the response when asked if US retaliation for the attack by Iran-backed militants could scuttle an emerging deal, Reuters reports.
The Qatari prime minister said US retaliation “will definitely have an impact … one way or another it will definitely have an impact on regional security and we hope things get contained.”
The drone attack was the first deadly strike against US forces since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October, and marked a major escalation in tensions that have engulfed the Middle East. CIA Director William Burns met sheikh Mohammed, as well as the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service and the head of Egyptian intelligence on Sunday in Paris for talks described as constructive by Israel, Qatar and the US, albeit with significant gaps remaining.
Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US will respond “decisively” to aggression and hold those responsible for the drone attack on a US military base in Jordan that killed three US troops and wounded dozens more to account. The three US service personnel who were killed in the drone strike have been named by the Pentagon as Sgt William Jerome Rivers, 46, Specialist Kennedy Sanders, 24, and Specialist Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, vowed that the US will take “all necessary actions” to defend its troops, while the Pentagon said it did not believe that Iran is seeking a war with the US, and that Washington doesn’t want a war either.
The enemy drone that was used in the attack on a US base in Jordan may have been confused with an American drone returning to the US installation, according to a report. In describing the drone attack, the two US officials, who were not authorised to comment and insisted on anonymity, said preliminary accounts suggest the enemy drone that struck the installation known as Tower 22 may have been mistaken for an American drone that was in the air at the same time. An Iranian-made drone was used in the deadly attack on Sunday, according to one US official.
The framework for a deal that could lead to a ceasefire and the release of hostages held in Gaza is being put to the Hamas leadership, Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said on Monday. Speaking after talks in Paris between officials from the US, Qatar, Egypt and Israel, he said: “We are in a better place than we were a few weeks ago.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, also voiced hope. The US believes talks are “moving in a good direction” but there is no imminent deal, the White House said.
Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine reiterated that Israel must halt its offensive and withdraw from Gaza before any prisoner exchange takes place. Israel remains opposed to a permanent ceasefire and wants to retain a right to recommence hostilities against Hamas – something the Hamas leadership wants ruled out. A senior Hamas official, Taher al-Nunu, said the Palestinian militant group wanted a “complete and comprehensive ceasefire” in Gaza.
The UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has warned it would not be able to continue operations in Gaza and across the region beyond the end of February if funding did not resume. Israel has claimed several UNRWA staff took part in the 7 October attacks or in the aftermath, including a school counsellor who allegedly kidnapped an Israeli woman. A string of western countries including the US and the UK have suspended funding to the agency, which provides aid to more than 5.6 million Palestinian refugees across the Middle East. The charity ActionAid described the withdrawal of funding for UNRWA as a “death sentence” for the population of Gaza.
At least 26,637 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza and a further 65,387 injured, according to the latest figures by Gaza’s health ministry on Monday. Two hundred and fifteen Palestinians were killed in the last 24 hours, the ministry reported.
The surgical ward at al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza has completely halted operations due to oxygen supplies running out, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on Monday. Heavy fighting has continued around hospitals in Khan Younis over the past few days, the UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA said in its latest update on the conflict, noting that only 14 of 36 hospitals in Gaza are now partially functional. Khan Younis’ Nasser hospital, until recently the largest still accepting patients in southern Gaza, is now only “minimally functioning”, OCHA said.
Israel has struck an Iran-linked site south of the Syrian capital, Damascus, killing several people on Monday. Iranian and Syrian official media said the attacks came from the Golan Heights and were attributed to Israel. They have not been regarded as a direct response to the attack on the Tower 22 base on Jordan’s border with Iraq and Syria. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit a farm housing members of Lebanon’s Iran-backed militant Hezbollah group and other Iran-backed factions. It said seven people were killed, including four Syrians, one of whom was the bodyguard of a member of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guards.
Israeli troops will “very soon go into action” near the country’s northern border with Lebanon, the country’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said. The Israeli minister, addressing troops near the Gaza border on Monday, also warned that the war against Hamas “will take months”, and claimed that quarter of Hamas fighters have been killed and at least another quarter have been wounded.
Five Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in four different incidents in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in the past 24 hours, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that 378 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank since 7 October.
Israeli politicians and ministers have attended a conference calling for Israeli resettlement of the Gaza Strip and “voluntary migration” of the Palestinian population elsewhere. The prominent role of government figures in the far-right conference on Sunday appears to violate the international court of justice ruling last week that Israel must “take all measures within its power” to avoid acts of genocide in its war in Gaza, including the “prevention and punishment of genocidal rhetoric”. The White House described the comments as “irresponsible, reckless and incendiary”.
The US and the UK announced sanctions against individuals who they said targeted Iranian dissidents and activists for assassination at the direction of the Iranian regime. The UK Foreign Office announced sanctions against seven individuals and one organisation who it said were involved in threats to kill journalists on British soil, and others it said were part of international criminal gangs linked to Iran.
US government employees are planning a “day of fasting for Gaza” this week to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis in the territory and to denounce Joe Biden’s policy toward Israel.
More than 1,000 musical artists from the Eurovision host country, Sweden, have signed an open letter calling for Israel to be excluded from this year’s edition of the song contest over its “brutal warfare in Gaza”.
Published in Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, the open letter says that by allowing Israel to participate, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) “is exhibiting a remarkable double standard that undermines the organisation’s credibility”.
The letter, published late on Monday, reads:
The fact that countries that place themselves above humanitarian law are welcomed to participate in international cultural events trivialises violations of international law and makes the suffering of the victims invisible.
Signatories include internationally successful artists such as the singers Robyn and Fever Ray, the folk duo First Aid Kit, and former Swedish Eurovision contestants such as Eric Saade and Malena Ernman, the mezzo-soprano opera singer who is also the mother of the climate activist Greta Thunberg.
The letter comes after a similar petition signed by about 1,400 artists from Finland and Iceland who also called for Israel to be excluded from the song contest, which will be held in Malmö from 7 to 11 May.
Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, will meet with families of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza at the White House on Tuesday, a US official said.
Several families of the hostages are in Washington DC this week, while others may dial in to the meeting, the administration told CNN.
The meeting comes as the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, voiced hope for a new deal that could lead to the release of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza.
The framework for such a deal is being put to the Hamas leadership, Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said earlier today after talks in Paris between officials from the US, Qatar, Egypt and Israel.
Joe Biden has vowed to hold all those responsible for the drone attack on a US military base in Jordan to account “at a time and in a manner of our choosing”.
The US president shared a picture of a meeting earlier today with his national security team, including the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, on the attack that killed three American service personnel and wounded dozens of people.

New Zealand will not commit to its $1m NZD (£482,210) annual payment to the UNRWA, following accusations over its staff’s involvement in Hamas’s 7 October  attacks, until it is satisfied with the outcome of the UN’s investigation.
Speaking to media on Tuesday morning, the prime minister, Christopher Luxon, said New Zealand would pause its contribution – due in June – until its foreign minister, Winston Peters, is happy to give it the green light.
I mean the allegations are incredibly serious, it’s important they are properly understood and investigated, we won’t be making any further contributions until the foreign minister says it’s good to do so.
Luxon said New Zealand remains committed to supporting the humanitarian response in Gaza, and will continue to call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access.
What I’d just remind everybody is that our funding is about a million dollars a year, we’ve already offered $10m  in humanitarian assistance and we’ve split that money between the International Red Cross and also the World Food Programme.
Helen Clark – a former New Zealand prime minister and former UN Development Programme administrator – has urged western countries to reinstate the funding to avoid “a harsh collective punishment of the Gazan people”.
A US official has said that a Iranian-made drone was used in the deadly attack on Sunday against on a US military base in Jordan, according to a report.
The official told CBS that the drone used in the attack wasa “type of Shahed drone”, a one-way attack drone that Iran has been providing to Russia.
Iran has denied it was behind the drone strike, but Islamic Resistance in Iraq have claimed responsibility as part of efforts, galvanised by the Israel-Hamas war, to try to drive US troops out of Iraq and Syria.
France has condemned a conference held in Jerusalem on Sunday promoting the Israeli resettlement of the Gaza Strip and “voluntary migration” of the Palestinian population elsewhere.
The event, called the “Victory of Israel Conference: Settlement Brings Security”, hosted speeches by members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government including the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.
In their remarks on Sunday, both Ben-Gvir and Smotrich called for the re-establishment of Jewish settlements in Gaza and the north of the West Bank, known to some Israelis as Samaria.
The conference was attended by 11 cabinet ministers and 15 members of the Knesset, some of them members of the prime minister’s Likud party.
A spokesperson for the French foreign ministry said:
We expect from the Israeli authorities a clear denunciation of these position.
Antony Blinken was asked about the Biden administration’s response to the international court of justice (ICJ) ruling last week ordering Israel to “take all measures within its power” to prevent its forces from carrying out genocide against Palestinians.
The US continues to “believe clearly that allegations of genocide are without merit”, the secretary of state told reporters.
He said Washington has consistently made clear to Israel about the imperative of taking every possible step to protect civilian life in Gaza, to get humanitarian assistance to those who need it, and to address the “dehumanising” rhetoric from some individuals. Blinken added:
The court in this decision agreed with that. The court’s ruling is also very consistent with our view that Israel has the right to take action to ensure that the terrorist attacks of October 7 never happen again, in accordance with international law.
The US will continue to monitor the UN court’s proceedings as it moved forward with the case, he added.
Antony Blinken described the proposal on the table for a new hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas as “strong and compelling”.
The US secretary of state noted “the less said the better” in terms of negotiations on a new hostage deal, but that the work that is being done is “important and hopeful”.
He said Hamas “will have to make its own decisions”, and that it is his “strong assessment” that Israel would “very much like to see this process of hostages coming out”. He added:
I can say that very important, productive work has been done, and there is some real hope going forward.
The US will look hard at what steps the UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) takes in response to “deeply troubling” allegations that some of its employees took part in the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, Antony Blinken said.
The secretary of state said he had a “good conversation” with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, who had informed him of these allegations.
Blinken said the US will be “looking very hard” at the steps taken to make sure that the allegations are fully and thoroughly investigated, that there is clear accountability, and that necessary measures are put in place to prevent it from happening. He said:
It is imperative that UNRWA immediately, as it said it would, investigate, that it hold people accountable as necessary, and that it review its procedures.
He noted that while the US has not investigated the allegations, that the claims are “highly credible”.
Blinken said UNRWA has played an “absolutely indispensable” role in getting desperately needed assistance to Palestinians in Gaza, and that no one else can play that role. “It’s more than imperative that that role continues,” he added.
US secretary of state Antony Blinken noted that the situation in the Middle East is “incredibly volatile”, adding:
I would argue that we’ve not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we’re facing now across the region at least 1973, and arguably even before that.
The US will defend its personnel and interests, and has taken significant action to deter groups and degrade their capabilities in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, he said.
President Biden has been “very clear that we want to prevent broader escalation” in the region but has also warned that the US will respond “strongly” to anyone who will try to use the crisis to create further instability or attack American personnel, he said.
Blinken said:
As the president said yesterday, we will respond. That response could be multi-levelled, come in stages, and be sustained over time.
The secretary of state emphasised that the US “does not seek conflict” with Iran but will respond “very vigorously” to the drone attack in Jordan.
Antony Blinken said the US remains focused on its core objectives in the Middle East, ie “To build a truly durable peace and security”.
The US secretary of state noted that it is critical to find a formula for a “durable end to the cycle of violence” in the region, in which Israel can “move forward in peace and security” and a Palestinian Authority “that is reformed and a clear pathway to a Palestinian state”.
The way to durable security is through a region “that is more integrated, where the relations among its countries are normalised, and where the question of the rights of Palestinians are finally answered”, he said.

We’ll be closing the blog now, thank you for following. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he will not accept any ceasefire deal that requires the departure of Israeli troops from Gaza or the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners. Netanyahu poured cold water on any deal that required Israeli soldiers to leave Gaza permanently without a clear military victory, saying the war in Gaza was not “another round” with Hamas and he would not end it without achieving Israel’s goals.
The Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said he was willing to travel to Cairo to discuss proposals for a potential new deal. Haniyeh said the group’s aim remained to end Israel’s military offensive in Gaza and secure a full pullout of Israeli forces from the territory. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad secretary general, Ziad al-Nakhala, ruled out the group engaging in any ceasefire that does not involve the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip.
Egypt, Qatar and the US are hoping to see if the two sides can be persuaded to accept a ceasefire lasting at least a month, which would offer the chance for almost all the hostages to be released. The proposal, described as a framework, was hammered out during talks in Paris. Leaks suggest the first phase of the proposed ceasefire would include the release of about 35 hostages including civilian women, older men and hostages who are ill or injured, in return for a six-week pause of the fighting. The second stage would be focused on male and female soldiers, and the third stage would see the release of the bodies of dead hostages.
Joe Biden has said he has decided how to respond to a drone attack on a US service base on Sunday that killed three US service personnel and injured dozens in Jordan. The US president did not elaborate on his decision but said he wasn’t looking for a wider war in the Middle East. The US could opt for a tiered response involving “multiple actions”, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said.
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said Israel intends to retain military control of Gaza after the war and run it in the same way it runs the occupied West Bank. Addressing members of the Knesset on Tuesday, Gallant said the work inside the Gaza Strip, where Israel claims to be clearing out Hamas terror infrastructure, was “finite” and was making progress despite challenges.
Israeli forces dressed in doctors’ scrubs and women’s clothes killed three Palestinian militants in an undercover operation in a hospital in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin. The units entered Ibn Sina hospital on the outskirts of the city’s refugee camp early on Tuesday, CCTV footage of the aftermath of the operation showed. The hospital’s medical director said the three killed were “executed in cold blood”.
The Israel Defense Forces denied reports that its forces stormed al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, or that it ordered people inside to evacuate at gunpoint. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) on Tuesday said Israeli forces had demanded displaced people and its teams to evacuate the building “under the threat of arms”. A later update said Israeli tanks were stationed in the front yard of the hospital as Israeli forces were firing live ammunition and smoke grenades at displaced individuals and its staff. The PRCS said a woman was killed and nine others injured by shrapnel from Israeli tank fire near al-Amal hospital and its headquarters.
The Israeli military said it had channelled seawater into Gaza’s tunnels in an effort to destroy the sprawling underground network used by Hamas militants. An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) statement said it was “part of a range of tools deployed by the IDF to neutralise the threat of Hamas’s subterranean network of tunnels.” Israeli officials have said Hamas’s underground system has been key to its operations on the battlefield.
A total of 26,751 Palestinians have now been killed and 65,636 wounded by Israeli military action in Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures from the Gaza health ministry on Tuesday. The figures include 114 Palestinians killed and 249 injured in the past 24 hours. Israel claims it has killed about 9,000 enemy combatants while losing 221 of its own forces in the ground campaign inside the territory.
Israel has handed over to Palestinian authorities the bodies of dozens of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza in recent weeks, health officials in the Palestinian territory have said. The bodies, which had been held in Israel, were handed over on Tuesday through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing and would be buried in mass graves in the city of Rafah in the south of the Gaza Strip, the officials said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged donors not to suspend funding to the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA after Israel accused some of its workers of taking part in Hamas’s 7 October attack. “Cutting off funding will only hurt the people of Gaza who desperately need support,” the WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said at a briefing in Geneva on Tuesday. International aid agencies have said they are “deeply concerned and outraged” at the “reckless” decision by major donors to cut funding to a UN Palestinian aid agency, which provides aid to more than 5.6 million Palestinian refugees across the Middle East.
Protesters gathered at the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza for the seventh consecutive day aiming to block trucks carrying humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. The group, including family members of some of those being held hostage, said “no aid should pass until the last of the hostages returns”.
Britain will consider recognising a Palestinian state as part of concerted efforts to bring about an “irreversible” peace settlement, the foreign secretary, David Cameron, has said. Cameron will this week make his fourth visit to the Middle East since being appointed foreign secretary in November as he presses for a de-escalation of tensions. The UK government has not changed its policy on the best timing to recognise Palestine as an independent state but wishes to give Palestinians a sense of a political horizon by highlighting the possibility is part of UK thinking, the Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said after Cameron’s comments.
The UK said it was “alarmed” by a conference held in Jerusalem on Sunday calling for Israeli resettlement of the Gaza Strip and “voluntary migration” of the Palestinian population elsewhere, which was attended by several Israeli cabinet ministers. “The UK’s position is clear: Gaza is occupied Palestinian territory and will be part of the future Palestinian state,” the UK Foreign Office said on Tuesday.
Yemen’s Houthis are ready for a “long-term confrontation” with the US and UK, a commander has said. “The Americans, the British and those who coordinated with them must realise the power of the sovereign Yemeni decision and that there is no debate or dispute over it,” Mohamed al-Atifi said.
Dozens of protesters gathered outside the offices of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in Beirut on Tuesday after more than 10 western countries said they would suspend funding after Israel accused some of its workers of taking part in Hamas’ 7 October attack.
“We are afraid for the future of UNRWA,” Abu Mohammed, 65, a Palestinian refugee, told AFP as he urged countries to “reverse their decision”.
All our children study in UNRWA schools and most of our medical care is covered by the agency … The suspension of aid would be catastrophic from a social and humanitarian perspective.
UNRWA, formed in 1949 after the creation of Israel, supports more than 5.6 million Palestinians in the occupied territories, including Jerusalem, and refugees and their descendants in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
Lebanon hosts an estimated 250,000 Palestinian refugees, most of whom live in poverty.
“Even though I have a job, UNRWA helps me pay my rent and buy food,” said Dima Dahouk, 40, the sole breadwinner for her four children. “The situation is terrible,” she added.
The UN’s coordinator for Gaza aid has said no organisation can “replace or substitute” the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), after Israeli allegations that some employees were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks.
Sigrid Kaag said:
There is no way that any organization can replace or substitute [the] tremendous capacity, the fabric of UNRWA – [its] ability and their knowledge of the population in Gaza.
As we reported earlier, the World Health Organization has urged donors not to suspend funding to UNRWA, arguing that doing so “will only hurt the people of Gaza who desperately need support”.
International aid agencies have said they are “deeply concerned and outraged” at the “reckless” decision by major donors to cut funding to the aid agency.
Sweden on Tuesday became the latest country to announce it will pause funding for UNRWA, joining the US, UK, Germany and others.
The UK has said it was “alarmed” by a conference held in Jerusalem on Sunday calling for Israeli resettlement of the Gaza Strip and “voluntary migration” of the Palestinian population elsewhere, which was attended by several Israeli cabinet ministers.
A statement from the UK Foreign Office reads:
The UK’s position is clear: Gaza is occupied Palestinian territory and will be part of the future Palestinian state.
Settlements are illegal. No Palestinian should be threatened with forcible displacement or relocation.
Sunday’s event, called the “Victory of Israel Conference: Settlement Brings Security”, hosted speeches by well-known extremists in Netanyahu’s cabinet including the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.
In their remarks, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich called for the re-establishment of Jewish settlements in Gaza and the north of the West Bank, known to some Israelis as Samaria.
The conference was attended by approximately 1,000 people, including 11 cabinet ministers and 15 members of the Knesset, some of them members of the prime minister’s Likud party.
Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, met visiting Qatari prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, in Washington earlier today to discuss ongoing efforts to secure a new hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said.
Sullivan will also be meeting later today at the White House with several family members of hostages still being held in Gaza, Kirby told reporters.
The US could have a tiered response to the drone strike that killed three American service personnel and wounded dozens others, the White House has said.
The White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters that the US response could involve multiple actions rather than a single action. Kirby said:
It’s fair for you to expect that we will respond in an appropriate fashion and it is very possible that what you’ll see is a tiered approach here, not just a single action, but essentially multiple actions.
His comments came after Joe Biden said he had made up his mind on how to respond to the drone attack in Jordan.
The Israeli military said it has channelled seawater into Gaza’s tunnels in a bid to destroy the sprawling underground network used by Hamas militants.
An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) statement said it had “implemented new capabilities to neutralise underground terrorist infrastructure in the Gaza Strip by channelling large volumes of water into the tunnels”. It added:
It is part of a range of tools deployed by the IDF to neutralise the threat of Hamas’s subterranean network of tunnels.
A Wall Street Journal report in December said the Israeli army had begun pumping seawater from the Mediterranean into Hamas’s underground tunnels in Gaza.
There were 1,300 tunnels over 500km in Gaza at the start of the war in October, according to a study from the US military academy West Point.
Israeli officials have said Hamas’s underground system has been key to its operations on the battlefield. Israel believes that many of the hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attacks have been or continue to be held in the vast network of tunnels.
Experts have warned that flooding the tunnel network with seawater risks “ruining the basic conditions for life in Gaza”, one of the elements of the crime of genocide.
Israeli tanks are stationed in the front yard of al-Amal hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society has said.
In an update posted to social media, the organisation said Israeli forces are firing live ammunition and smoke grenades and displaced individuals and its staff. It said:
Fires have broken out in tents within the confines of the PRCS Headquarters.
The post added that it was deeply worried about the safety of its teams, the wounded and thousands of displaced people in the building.
Israeli tanks are currently stationed in AL-Amal hospital front yard, firing live ammunition and smoke grenades at the displaced individuals and PRCS staff. We deeply worry for the safety of our teams, the wounded, the sick, and thousands of displaced people in the building. 🔥…
The framework for a deal that could lead to a ceasefire and the release of hostages held in Gaza was discussed by Israel’s war cabinet on Monday evening.
The proposal for a deal was hammered out between Egypt, Qatar, the US and Israel on Sunday in talks in Paris. The location of the talks meant that Hamas negotiators could not be present.
Described as a framework, the proposal has not yet been put to a vote in the Israeli war cabinet, a senior Israeli official told NBC on Tuesday.
The last deal was approved first by the Israeli war cabinet, then by the larger security cabinet, and finally by the full government. The official told the outlet that any future deal would likely go through the same process.
They noted that a major sticking point remains the duration of a pause in fighting. Israel has said it would only be temporary, Hamas has demanded a permanent ceasefire. The Israeli official said:
If there’s going to be a deal, there will have to be a meeting of minds. We won’t agree to an end to the hostilities. It’s clear from our perspective it has to be a time out in the fighting.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he will not accept any ceasefire deal that requires the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners or the departure of Israeli troops from Gaza.
Meanwhile, Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s secretary general Ziad al-Nakhala has ruled out the group engaging in any ceasefire that does not involve the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip.
Canada has announced a new C$40m (£23.5m) funding to provide food, water and other humanitarian assistance after pausing funding for the UN’s relief agency in the region.
Canada has suspended “additional funding” for UNRWA following allegations by Israel that some of its staff were involved in the Hamas attacks on 7 October.
The bulk of the new funding will go to the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO), Unicef, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs.
Iran has summoned the British ambassador, state media reported, a day after the UK and US announced sanctions on a network purportedly involved in targeting Iranian dissidents and opposition activists for assassination.
Simon Shercliff, the British ambassador in Tehran, was summoned to the Iranian foreign affairs ministry and “informed of our country’s strong protest” following the “continuation of the British regime’s accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran”, Iranian state news agency reported.
It comes after Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said on Monday he “absolutely condemned” the drone strike on a US military base in Jordan, which the US president, Joe Biden, said had been carried out by Iran-backed militants.
On the same day, the UK and US imposed sanctions on a network of people accused of being directed by Iran’s ministry of intelligence and security, who they said had carried out assassinations and kidnappings aiming to silence Tehran’s perceived critics.
Britain imposed sanctions on Iranian officials it said were involved in threats to kill journalists on British soil, and others it said were part of international criminal gangs linked to Iran.

State department identifies Israeli citizens targeted by US sanctions as Netanyahu rejects them as ‘unnecessary’ – as it happened,2024-02-01,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/feb/01/us-congress-child-tax-credit-biden-trump-us-politics-live,"This live blog is now closed. For more on the US involvement in the Middle East crisis, you can read:
The US state department has released the names of four Israeli nationals subjected to sanctions under Biden’s new executive order.
David Chai Chasdai
Einan Tanjil
Shalom Zicherman
Yinon Levi
According to the state department, Chasdai “initiated and led a riot, which involved setting vehicles and buildings on fire, assaulting Palestinian civilians, and causing damage to property in Huwara, which resulted in the death of a Palestinian civilian”.
It accuses Tanjil of involvement in the assault of “Palestinian farmers and Israeli activists by attacking them with stones and clubs, resulting in injuries that required medical treatment”.
Zicherman was seen on video assaulting “Israeli activists and their vehicles in the West Bank, blocking them on the street, and attempted to break the windows of passing vehicles with activists inside,” it said. He “cornered at least two of the activists and injured both”.
Levi “led a group of settlers who engaged in actions creating an atmosphere of fear in the West Bank. He regularly led groups of settlers from the Meitarim Farm outpost that assaulted Palestinian and Bedouin civilians, threatened them with additional violence if they did not leave their homes, burned their fields, and destroyed their property. Levi and other settlers at Meitarim Farm have repeatedly attacked multiple communities within the West Bank.”
Good afternoon. It’s been another lively day in Washington. Thanks for reading.
Here’s what we covered today:
Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, announced that the long-awaited text of a border deal to unlock aid to Ukraine and Israel could be released as early as tomorrow and said to expect a vote next week. Despite months of painstaking, bipartisan negotiations between senators and the White House, the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, has already declared it “dead on arrival” amid opposition from Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner who hopes to use immigration as a cudgel against Joe Biden.
Meanwhile, Biden announced that the US will place sanctions on Israeli settlers in the West Bank, via presidential executive order, citing “intolerable levels” of violence. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the action as “unnecessary.” The state department on Thursday released the names of four Israeli citizens targeted in a first round of sanctions under the new authority. For latest updates on the Middle East, you can follow our live coverage here.
Defense secretary Lloyd Austin, was contrite in a Pentagon press briefing this morning, his first since being rushed to the hospital with complications from prostate cancer surgery that he kept secret from the president and the public for several days. “I want to be crystal clear: we did not handle this right and I did not handle this right,” Austin told reporters.
Biden praised the Ukrainians people’s “incredible resolve and resilience against Putin’s aggression” and demanded afresh of Congress: “We must continue to help them.” The White House’s request to send nearly $110bn in additional security assistance and aid to Ukraine is on hold on Capitol Hill amid House Republican resistance.
The US House of Representatives last night passed a nearly $79bn tax package that would expand the child tax credit for millions and revive a trio of tax breaks for businesses.
Criticizing the policies included in the bipartisan border deal as “Republican light,” Democratic congressman Greg Casar lamented Joe Biden‘s recent statement indicating that he would move to “shut down the border” if the deal becomes law.
“I’m a supporter of the president, but I think that he made a big mistake with that statement. The president’s statement reflects not just bad policy but bad politics,” Casar said.
“‘Shutting down the border’ means that we’re further empowering cartels and criminal organizations to move people across the border. We need to be creating legal pathways for migration.”
Republican lawmakers have demanded that Biden sign off on severe border measures in exchange for approving additional aid for Ukraine, and Casar advised the president against accepting those terms.
“I do not think we should be playing into that kind of a hostage-taking situation. It’s bad policy,” Casar said. “And I don’t think that it will be good politics for the president either because these Republican policies are not going to create a more orderly situation at the border.”
Conservative opposition to the border bill has received much of the attention. But progressives are also alarmed by the emerging proposal, as the Guardian’s Joan Greve reports.
Congressman Greg Casar, a progressive Democrat of Texas, expressed grave concerns today about the border deal recently brokered by the Biden administration and a bipartisan group of senators.
“It really worries me to hear these negotiations with the US Senate, where it feels that Republican, anti-immigrant policies could make their way into law even under a Democratic president,” Casar said on a press call.
“I just don’t think that that is the way to go. We have to respond to this anti-immigrant propaganda with a proactive vision that recognizes that immigration is a good thing.”
The Senate negotiators have not yet released bill text of the border deal, and it remains highly unclear whether the proposal can pass through Congress. Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, has already attacked the proposal as insufficient and has indicated that the legislation would be “dead on arrival” in the lower chamber.
The group of senators working on the border deal have defended it against what they claim are rumors and misinformation about the bill’s contents. Conservatives are under pressure from Donald Trump to reject the deal, despite arguing that border enforcement is their top priority.
Senator Kyrsten Sinema, an Independent of Arizona who has helped lead the talks, outlined some of the provisions for reporters on Capitol Hill yesterday.
According to Axios, she said the plan would include strict new measures to tighten and speed up asylum claims as well as changes the way enforcement agents use detention, deportation and parole.
Switching back for a moment to matters of domestic policy – albeit it an issue with major global implications for US immigration policy, aid to Ukraine and support for Israel and Taiwan: Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, just announced that the text of a long-awaited border security bill could be released as early as tomorrow (Friday), with a vote expected next week.
Schumer from Senate floor on border security-foreign aid bill:""The Senate will be in session & will hold a vote on Monday, Feb. 5th.There is no longer a no vote day....We plan to post the full text of the national security supplemental as early as tomorrow, no later than Sunday."" pic.twitter.com/KpEKmuYrCw
For months, Senate negotiators have worked behind the scenes to broker a border deal that would unlock military aid to Ukraine and Israel. But it faces long odds in the Republican-controlled House, where the speaker, Mike Johnson, has already rejected the measure outright, despite not knowing what exactly is in the bill.
My colleague Peter Beaumont notes in his full report on the sanctions that they follow a US visa ban for any Israeli settlers implicated in attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank announced last month.
The new order will give the treasury department the authority to impose financial sanctions on settlers engaged in violence, but is not meant to target US citizens. A substantial number of the settlers in the West Bank hold US citizenship and they would be prohibited under US law from transacting with the sanctioned individuals.
The Guardian’s Chris McGreal has a deeper dive into how American citizens have been leading the rise in settler-related violence in the West Bank, which you can read here:
Biden has landed in the Detroit area, ahead of an event with auto workers. But expect senior administration officials to return to the state this month to meet with community leaders amid deep anger at the president’s handling of the war in Gaza, Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.
New: Sr. Biden administration officials will travel to Michigan this month ""to hear directly from community leaders on a range of issues that are important to them and their families, including the conflict of Israel and Gaza,"" @PressSec tells reporters en route to MI.
Past outreach attempts by the administration have … not gone well. Participants have been open about their frustration with Biden and what they view as his failure to rein in Israel’s devastating military campaign in Gaza.
Arab American voters are a relatively small but growing constituency that has historically favored Democrats. In battleground states such as Michigan and Georgia, home to large Arab and Muslim American communities, even the tiniest erosion of support could hurt Biden’s prospects for re-election. Representative Rashida Tlaib, the lone Palestinian American in Congress, who represents a Detroit-area district, has said so explicitly. In a video calling on the Biden administration to back a ceasefire, she appears before text that reads: “We will remember in 2024.”
In a statement, the office of Benjamin Netanyahu said the vast majority of West Bank settlers as “law-abiding citizens” and described Biden’s executive order sanctioning settler extremists as “exceptional”.
Prime Minister's Office Statement on US President Biden's Executive Order:The overwhelming majority of residents in Judea and Samaria are law-abiding citizens, many of whom are currently fighting – as conscripts and reservists – to defend Israel.
“Israel acts against all Israelis who break the law, everywhere; therefore, exceptional measures are unnecessary,” the statement continued.
The US state department has released the names of four Israeli nationals subjected to sanctions under Biden’s new executive order.

According to the state department, Chasdai “initiated and led a riot, which involved setting vehicles and buildings on fire, assaulting Palestinian civilians, and causing damage to property in Huwara, which resulted in the death of a Palestinian civilian”.
It accuses Tanjil of involvement in the assault of “Palestinian farmers and Israeli activists by attacking them with stones and clubs, resulting in injuries that required medical treatment”.
Zicherman was seen on video assaulting “Israeli activists and their vehicles in the West Bank, blocking them on the street, and attempted to break the windows of passing vehicles with activists inside,” it said. He “cornered at least two of the activists and injured both”.
Levi “led a group of settlers who engaged in actions creating an atmosphere of fear in the West Bank. He regularly led groups of settlers from the Meitarim Farm outpost that assaulted Palestinian and Bedouin civilians, threatened them with additional violence if they did not leave their homes, burned their fields, and destroyed their property. Levi and other settlers at Meitarim Farm have repeatedly attacked multiple communities within the West Bank.”
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre just wrapped up the media briefing on Air Force One, as the flight was about to descend towards the Detroit area, where Joe Biden is heading to a campaign event to meet auto workers.
Jean-Pierre was asked whether the executive order setting up sanctions against certain Israeli settlers in the West Bank was announced today to, essentially, appease Muslim Americans incensed by America’s tenacious support and funding for Israel even as its military decimates Gaza in response to the attack by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7.
The Detroit area has a huge Arab American population and protests are expected during Biden’s visit today.
Jean-Pierre denied that the timing was intentional, adding that “these types of sanctions take a long time” to plan and impose.
The US government informed the Israeli government before it publicly announced earlier today that Joe Biden was issuing an executive order in relation to the occupied West Bank, the White House just confirmed.
The US will place sanctions on Israeli settlers in the West Bank, with the US president citing “intolerable levels” of violence against Palestinians there.
John Kirby, the national security spokesman, based in the White House, was asked in the press briefing now underway whether Biden had informed Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu before he issued the executive order.
“We informed the Israeli government before it was announced,” Kirby said.
Asked again if that communication had been at the level of president to prime minister, Kirby repeated his answer.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has called on the Biden administration to “immediately sanction” what Cair termed far-right Israeli officials who enable violence by illegal Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank.
Biden issued an executive order today imposing sanctions on Israeli settlers who have been attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
The Biden administration should use this executive order to immediately sanction Israeli government officials who are enabling settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Just as importantly, President Biden must end American support for the Israeli government’s genocidal war on the people of Gaza. It makes no sense for the Biden administration to oppose killing Palestinian civilians in the West Bank while enabling the killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” Cair national deputy director Edward Ahmed Mitchell said.
Hello, it’s been a lively few hours in Washington, on Capitol Hill and at the White House. We await a briefing from press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and national security spokesman John Kirby, so stand by for that. Looks like that will go ahead at 1.30pm ET as the two spox and reporters accompany Joe Biden to Michigan, aboard Air Force One.
Here’s how the day is going:
Joe Biden announced that the US will place sanctions on Israeli settlers in the West Bank, via presidential executive order, citing “intolerable levels” of violence.
Americans’ views of the economy are improving, but their views of Biden are not. That’s according to a new AP-Norc poll that found a notable increase in the percentage of US adults who called the US economy “good”, but that’s not translating into support for the president.
Defense secretary Lloyd Austin, was contrite in a Pentagon press briefing this morning, his first since being rushed to the hospital with complications from prostate cancer surgery that he kept secret from the president and the public for several days. “I want to be crystal clear: we did not handle this right and I did not handle this right,” Austin told reporters.
Joe Biden praised the Ukrainians people’s “incredible resolve and resilience against Putin’s aggression” and demanded afresh of Congress: “We must continue to help them.” The White House’s request to send nearly $110bn in additional security assistance and aid to Ukraine is on hold on Capitol Hill amid House Republican resistance.
The US House of Representatives last night passed a nearly $79bn tax package that would expand the child tax credit for millions and revive a trio of tax breaks for businesses. Yes, that House – the Republican-controlled one that booted its Speaker and has repeatedly brought the US government to the brink of a shutdown!
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz suggested the move to sanction Israeli settlers was without precedent, calling it “arguably the most punitive measure ever taken from the US government against Israeli citizens”.
Four Israelis are expected to be sanctioned under the new authority, according to several news reports, with more expected to be punished in the future. Doing so blocks these individuals from engaging with the American financial system and from accessing their assets and property in the US as well as bars them from traveling to the US.
In a statement following the announcement of sanctions against Israeli settlers, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said the “record” spike in violence by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank “poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States”.
He said the executive order allows the US to impose financial sanctions against those it deems to have directed or particpated in acts of violence against civilians as well as those who have sought to displace them from their homes, destroyed property or engaged in “terrorist activity” in the West Bank.
“Today’s actions seek to promote peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike,” Sullivan said.
In December, the state department imposed a travel ban on some settlers.
In an executive order released moments ago, Biden announced that the US will place sanctions on Israeli settlers in the West Bank, citing “intolerable levels” of violence.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed by security forces and settlers across the occupied West Bank since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, according to the United Nations. The violence is separate from Israel’s military assault on Gaza, where the death toll is approaching 27,000 Palestinians.
In the notice to Congress, Biden said actions by Israeli settler extremists “constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States” and declared a national emergency to address it.
I, Joseph R Biden Jr, President of the United States of America, find that the situation in the West Bank – in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction – has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region,” reads the order.
“These actions undermine the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution and ensuring Israelis and Palestinians can attain equal measures of security, prosperity, and freedom. They also undermine the security of Israel and have the potential to lead to broader regional destabilization across the Middle East, threatening United States personnel and interests.”
Americans’ views of the economy are improving, but their views of Biden are not. That’s according to a new AP-Norc poll that found a notable increase in the percentage of US adults who called the US economy “good”.
Last year, just 24% of Americans rated the national economy as good, compared with 35% who do so now. It’s also an improvement from late last year when just 30% said so. The rosier outlook tracks with positive economic indicators: inflation has begun to recede and growth is strong.
While nearly two-thirds of Americans still call the economy poor, it’s an improvement from a year ago, when 76% described it that way, the survey found.
Still, that is not translating into support for the president, whose approval ratings are languishing at 38%, where it has stood mostly unchanged for the past two years. Just 35% of Americans approve of Biden’s handling of the economy. The evidence of a stronger economy has yet to spill over into greater support for Biden: the new poll puts his approval rating at 38%, which is roughly where that number has stood for most of the past two years. Biden’s approval rating on handling the economy is similar, at 35%.
Voters’ perceptions of the economy often shape elections, which is why Biden and his team are working to emphasize any sign of economic strength. But if Americans aren’t feeling it personally, the message is unlikely to resonant.
New reporting from the Associated Press reveals that Biden is expected to issue an executive order targeting Israeli settlers in the West Bank, where violence against Palestinians has surged in the occupied territory.
The report, based on four officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the White House was expected to announce the order later today. It comes as Biden departs for Michigan, a battleground state and home to a sizable Arab American population that is furious with the president over his handling of Israel’s war in Gaza.
Biden has faced growing criticism from Democrats amid rising Palestinian death toll and the destruction in Gaza. The move reflects the administration’s growing frustration with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, as the US ramps up pressure on its ally to show more restraint in its military operations in Gaza.
The AP reports: Israel Defense Forces stepped up raids across the West Bank after the war began. Hamas militants are present in the West Bank, but largely operate underground because of Israel’s tight grip on the territory. Palestinians complain that the Israeli crackdown in the West Bank have further blurred the line between security forces and radical, violent settlers.
The executive order is expected to set the ground for imposing sanctions on individuals who have engaged in violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan met on Wednesday at the White House with Ron Dermer, the Israeli minister of strategic affair. It was not clear whether the executive order was discussed.

Joe Biden issues executive order against Israeli settlers in West Bank,2024-02-01,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/01/joe-biden-expected-issue-order-israeli-settlers-west-bank-palestinians,"Financial sanctions and visa bans imposed on four individuals as US frustration with Israel grows
Joe Biden has issued an executive order targeting Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been attacking Palestinians, amid fast-growing frustration in Washington at Israel’s trajectory in the midst of its war in Gaza.
The order initially imposes financial sanctions and visa bans against four individuals, and US officials said they were evaluating whether to punish others involved in attacks that have intensified during the Israel-Hamas war.
According to at least one report before the executive order, options included the potential to sanction officials.
Palestinian authorities say some Palestinians have been killed, and rights groups say settlers have torched cars and attacked several small Bedouin communities, forcing evacuations.
In the order, Biden said that extremist settler violence in the West Bank had “reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region”.
He said: “These actions undermine the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution and ensuring Israelis and Palestinians can attain equal measures of security, prosperity, and freedom.
“They also undermine the security of Israel and have the potential to lead to broader regional destabilisation across the Middle East, threatening United States personnel and interests.”
Biden has been facing growing criticism for his administration’s strong support of Israel as casualties mount in the conflict, which began when Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, attacked Israel on 7 October.
The order is a rare step against the US’s closest ally in the Middle East as Biden has pressed Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to show greater restraint in its military operations aimed at rooting out Hamas.
Biden and other senior US officials have warned repeatedly that Israel must act to stop violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, which Palestinian authorities and activists say has intensified since the Gaza war started.
The Biden administration had also considered moves targeting two far-right Israeli ministers, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, according to a report on the Axios website.
Last month a US visa ban was announced for any Israeli settlers implicated in attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
The new order will give the Treasury department the authority to impose financial sanctions on settlers engaged in violence, but is not meant to target US citizens. A substantial number of the settlers in the West Bank hold US citizenship and they would be prohibited under US law from transacting with the sanctioned individuals.
Israel is facing growing international discontent over its repeated refusal to contemplate the establishment of a viable Palestinian state, amid growing warnings that countries including the US and the UK may be considering unilateral recognition of statehood.
After comments by the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, last week that the UK might consider recognition on the day after the war in Gaza ends, US officials have indicated that the state department has been ordered to examine options for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with security guarantees for Israel.
The state department’s spokesperson, Matthew Miller, declined to give details on its internal work on the issue but told a news briefing that the effort had been an objective of Biden’s administration.
The US and the UK, among other states, have long held up the goal of a Palestinian state as part of a negotiated peace process but recent moves in the midst of the Gaza war have highlighted the increasing sense of international frustration with Netanyahu, who has long worked to prevent a Palestinian state.
The Israeli prime minister has in recent weeks spoken of an extended period of military security control by Israel in Gaza while rejecting a role for any revitalised Palestinian Authority.
Washington and London appear to have indicated a change in emphasis in the sequencing of a recognition of a Palestinian state, which in the past was seen as the final step.
Miller told a state department briefing that the US was “actively pursuing the establishment as an independent Palestinian state, with real security guarantees for Israel, because we do believe that is the best way to bring about lasting peace and security for Israel, for Palestinians and for the region”.
He added: “There are any number of ways that you could go about accomplishing that. There are a number of sequencing of events that you can carry out to accomplish that objective. And we look at a wide range of options and we discuss those with partners in the region as well as other partners inside the United States government.”
Lord Cameron said the issue of recognising a Palestinian state would be part of a diplomatic process in which the Palestinian people would have to be shown “irreversible progress”.
Axios reported on Wednesday that the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had asked the state department to conduct a review and present policy options on possible US and international recognition of a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza.
The executive order comes as Biden was due to visit Michigan on Thursday to rally support from union members in a key presidential battleground state. The Democratic president has faced sharp criticism from Arab and Muslim leaders over his handling of the war with Hamas, and the shadow of the conflict has some Democrats worrying that it could have a major effect on the outcome of the November election.

UK manufacturers hit by Red Sea disruption and rising shipping costs ,2024-02-01,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/01/uk-manufacturers-hit-by-red-sea-disruption-and-rising-shipping-costs,"Supply chain difficulties have led to job losses and cuts in purchasing and stocks, S&P Global poll shows
Britain’s factories have been hit by disruption caused by Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea that led to shipping delays and contributed to rising costs, as the boss of Adidas warned about “exploding” global freight rates.
UK manufacturers have experienced growing supply chain difficulties, as the Red Sea crisis led to the rerouting of deliveries of raw materials, components and other goods away from the Suez Canal, a survey has shown.
The UK manufacturing sector remained in decline at the start of 2024, when output and new orders fell further, leading to more job losses and cuts in purchasing and stocks, according to the monthly survey from S&P Global.
Its purchasing managers’ index was at 47.0 in January, up from 46.2 in December but below an earlier flash estimate of 47.3. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction; any reading above points to expansion.
The Yemen-based Houthi rebels, who are aligned with Iran, have said they attacked ships in response to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. Israel is retaliating against an attack on 7 October by Hamas, which controls Gaza. The US and UK governments have launched airstrikes against the Houthi rebels.
Some manufacturers in the survey said 12 to 18 days could be added to some expected deliveries, disrupting their production schedules and raising inflationary pressures at a time when companies were struggling with weak demand at home and overseas.
Bjørn Gulden, the chief executive of Adidas, Europe’s largest sportswear manufacturer Adidas, said shipping disruptions would affect profit margins. He said “exploding” freight rates were driving up costs and shipping delays were causing some delivery problems.
Gulden said: “The spot rates are exploding again, so if you don’t have a long-term contract or you ship more than your contract there is an increased cost because of that.
“There is a delay currently of about three weeks which of course causes some delivery issues, especially to the European market.”
The world’s top shipping companies, including Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, have diverted ships from the Suez Canal and rerouted them around the southern tip of Africa, adding thousands of miles to journeys and delaying the arrival in Europe of manufacturing components and goods such as clothes and shoes made in Asia.
Rob Dobson, the director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “Cost and stock management initiatives are being complicated by the Red Sea crisis. Diverting purchased inputs, especially those sourced from the Asia-Pacific region, around the Cape of Good Hope is raising prices and extending supplier lead times.”

The Suez canal normally handles about 12% of global trade, and about half of freight shipped through the canal is made up of containerised goods. Oil shipments also travel through this route, from the Persian Gulf to Europe and North America, and the continued Houthi rebel attacks on container ships have driven crude oil prices higher.
In the US, the Institute for Supply Management’s latest manufacturing survey, also released on Thursday, showed supplier delivery times rebounded to their highest level in more than a year, while the prices paid index hit a nine-month high.
However, the overall manufacturing index bounced back to 49.1 in January from 47.1 in December, suggesting the downturn in the sector wasreceding.

Middle East crisis: UN agency calls Rafah a ‘pressure cooker of despair’ as Israel says offensive will move into city – as it happened,2024-02-02,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/02/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-israel-gaza-move-rafah-qatar-hamas-ceasefire-proposal,"Defence minister Yoav Gallant’s announcement comes despite presence of more than 1 million civilians in city
The UN humanitarian office on Friday voiced concern about the hostilities in Khan Younis that have forced more people to flee to Rafah in the south of Gaza, describing the border town as a “pressure cooker of despair”, reports Reuters.
“I want to emphasise our deep concern about the escalation of hostilities in Khan Younis, which has resulted in an increase in the number of internally displaced people seeking refuge in Rafah in recent days,” said Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs.
“Thousands of Palestinians have continued to flee to the south, which is already hosting over half the population of about 2.3 million people … Rafah is a pressure cooker of despair, and we fear for what comes next.”
Israeli forces will continue their Gaza military campaign to Rafah, the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant has said, despite the huge numbers of Palestinian civilians there.
It is 5.18pm in Gaza and Tel Aviv and 6.18pm in Sana’a. Here are the latest developments from today:
Rafah is a “pressure cooker of despair”, said the UN humanitarian office, as Palestinians flee south today. It said hostilities in Khan Younis had forced more people to flee to Rafah in the south of Gaza. “Thousands of Palestinians have continued to flee to the south, which is already hosting over half the population of about 2.3 million people … Rafah is a pressure cooker of despair, and we fear for what comes next,” said Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN agency.
Israeli forces will continue their Gaza military campaign to Rafah, the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant has said, despite the huge numbers of Palestinian civilians there.
Israel and Hamas appear to be inching closer towards a deal for a ceasefire and a release of some of the hostages still being held by the militant group in Gaza. Qatar, which has been mediating between Israel and Hamas, indicated that the militant group had given its initial support for a deal after weeks of delicate and secretive negotiations. However, while an aide to Hamas’s political leader said the group had received details of the proposed deal, it had yet to deliver a reply.
Fighting in Gaza raged on Friday with scores of people reportedly killed overnight. The Hamas press office reported Israeli air and artillery bombardment around Khan Younis – southern Gaza’s main city and the focus of recent fighting. AFP said that Israeli aircraft had again dropped leaflets calling on civilians to leave the area around al-Shifa hospital’s compound.
Nearly four months of fighting has left Gaza “uninhabitable”, the UN said, while the Israeli siege had resulted in dire shortages of food, water, fuel and medicines.
UNRWA said vital supplies of fuel and bread flour for Gaza risked running dry, while schools, clinics and rubbish collections in the West Bank and three countries across the Middle East could cease operating by the end of the month if funding cuts for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees were not restored.
A Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) employee was killed due to Israeli gunfire towards the organisation’s building in Khan Younis. Hidaya Hamad, who was the director of the youth and volunteers department in Gaza for the PRCS, was at the organisation’s headquarters when she was killed.
More than 1 million children in Gaza are in need of mental health support, says Unicef. Jonathan Crickx, spokesperson for the UN children’s agency Unicef in the Palestinian territories told a media briefing in Geneva, via video link from Jerusalem on Friday: “Children don’t have anything to do with this conflict. Yet they are suffering like no child should ever suffer.”
At least 17,000 children in the Gaza Strip have been left unaccompanied or separated, according to estimates from the UN. Crickx called for a ceasefire so that Unicef could conduct a proper count of children who are unaccompanied or separated, trace relatives, and deliver mental health support.
The UK could officially recognise a Palestinian state after a ceasefire in Gaza without waiting for the outcome of what could be years of talks between Israel and the Palestinians on a two-state solution, the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, has said. Speaking during a visit on Thursday to Lebanon intended to tamp down regional tensions, the foreign secretary said no recognition could come while Hamas remained in Gaza, but that it could take place while Israeli negotiations with Palestinian leaders were continuing.
Catherine Russell, Unicef’s executive director, has said that “the situation for children in Gaza grows bleaker every day”. In a post on X, Russell said: “The world cannot abandon them.”
The latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 112 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes and 148 were injured in the past 24 hours.
Belgium’s ministry of foreign affairs has summoned the Israeli ambassador to Belgium and strongly condemned the bombing of the Belgian development agency Enable. Idit Rosenzweig-Abu, the Israeli ambassador to Belgium, said: “Israel has been notified by the Belgian MFA on this incident yesterday at 22.00 [23.00 Israeli time]. We are currently investigating the circumstances around the alleged incident and will update the authorities once we receive more information.”
President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran said in a televised speech: “We will not start any war, but if anyone wants to bully us they will receive a strong response.”
Israeli security forces continued to limit the number of people able to worship at the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem for Friday prayers. It is the 17th consecutive week that restrictions on worship have been imposed.
An Iranian Revolutionary Guards adviser in Damascus has allegedly been killed in an Israeli missile attack that targeted a southern district of the Syrian capital, according to semi-official Iranian news sites, reported Al Jazeera. The news organisation said Iranian news sites had identified the adviser as Saeid Alidadi without sharing his rank.
The towns of Tayr Harfa and the outskirts of Wadi Hassan and Majdel Zoun in Lebanon were targeted by Israeli aerial and artillery strikes, reported Al Jazeera citing Lebanon’s NNA news agency. It added that Israeli warplanes also targeted the outskirts of the southern towns of Marwahin, Zibqin, and Jabal Balat.
The Syrian military says it downed a number of Israeli missiles launched from the Golan Heights that it said were targeting south Damascus on Friday, state news agency Sana reported citing a military source.
Attacks against US forces will continue, said Iraq’s armed group al-Nujaba. The Iran-backed Iraqi armed group said on Friday it will continue launching attacks on US forces until they withdraw from Iraq and the Gaza war ends. “Any [US] strike will result in an appropriate response,” al-Nujaba’s leader, Akram al-Kaabi, said in a statement.
A US federal court has dismissed a case accusing President Joe Biden and other senior US officials of being complicit in Israel’s alleged genocide in Gaza, reports Al Jazeera. Despite the dismissal, the court’s decision urged Biden and his colleagues to examine “the results of their unflagging support” for Israel, including its human rights implications, says the Qatar-funded media organisation.
Turkish police arrested seven people on Friday on suspicion of selling information to the Israeli intelligence service the Mossad, reports Associated Press, citing the state-run Anadolu news agency.
Joe and Jill Biden will join families at Dover air force base in Delaware on Friday to honour three US service members killed in a drone attack in Jordan. The deaths were the first US fatalities blamed on Iran-backed militia groups in the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war began.

Large crowds of Houthi supporters took to the streets in Sana’a, Yemen on Friday to protest against US-led strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen and to show support to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
Saudi Arabia would be willing to accept a political commitment from Israel to create a Palestinian state, rather than anything more binding, in a bid to get a defence pact with Washington approved before the US presidential election, three sources have told Reuters.
Half of US adults believe Israel’s war in Gaza has “gone too far”, a finding driven mainly by growing disapproval among Republicans and political independents, according to a poll by the Associated Press (AP) and the Norc centre for public affairs research.
Sweden’s intelligence service said on Friday that the investigation into a foiled attack on the Israeli embassy in Stockholm this week was being treated as a potential terrorist crime.
A far-right Israeli minister has been disinvited from a German-Israeli conference due to be opened by the German justice minister, Marco Buschmann, Germany’s Taz newspaper has reported.
Israel has accused the Australian government of forgetting “Hamas’s culpability” for the war in Gaza, in a sign of growing tensions as ministers consider reinstating funding to UNRWA.
Turkish authorities have formally arrested 25 suspects in connection with the shooting of a man during a service at a church in Istanbul last weekend, justice minister Yılmaz Tunç said on Friday.
Several members of the Palestinian-American community have refused to meet the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in Washington, the Huffington Post has reported.
The latest pro-Palestine march of hundreds of thousands of protesters through central London will end with a rally near Downing Street after a climbdown from the Metropolitan police. After a meeting on Thursday afternoon, organisers of the march said they had been given permission for the end stage of Saturday’s demonstration to take place on Whitehall.
Thousands of Houthi supporters took to the streets in Sana’a, Yemen’s capital city, on Friday to protest against US-led strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen and to show support to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Here are a couple of images from the news wires:
The towns of Tayr Harfa and the outskirts of Wadi Hassan and Majdel Zoun in Lebanon have been targeted by Israeli aerial and artillery strikes, reports Al Jazeera citing Lebanon’s NNA news agency.
It adds that Israeli warplanes also targeted the outskirts of the southern towns of Marwahin, Zibqin, and Jabal Balat.
Al Jazeera also cited a Times of Israel report that said sirens had sounded in four towns close to the Lebanon border: Kiryat Shmona, Tel Hai, Kfar Yuval and Ma’ayan Baruch. It added that the sirens were warnings of two waves of incoming rocket fire.
The news organisations said the communities have been largely evacuated of civilians since 8 October, when Lebanon’s Hezbollah group and the Israeli military began trading fire.
Jonathan Crickx, spokesperson for the UN children’s agency Unicef in the Palestinian territories also said the mental health of children in Gaza was being severely affected by the war. Crickx was speaking at a media briefing in Geneva, via video link from Jerusalem on Friday, reports AFP, during which he also spoke about the number of children in Gaza separated from their parents.
“They present symptoms like extremely high levels of persistent anxiety, loss of appetite, they can’t sleep, they have emotional outbursts or panic every time they hear the bombings,” he said.
Before the conflict erupted, Unicef estimated that more than 500,000 children in the Gaza Strip needed mental health and psycho-social support. Now it believes that “almost all children are in need” of such help – more than one million children, said Crickx.
“Children don’t have anything to do with this conflict. Yet they are suffering like no child should ever suffer,” said Crickx. “No child should ever be exposed to the level of violence seen on 7 October – or to the level of violence that we have witnessed since then.”
He called for a ceasefire so that Unicef could conduct a proper count of children who are unaccompanied or separated, trace relatives, and deliver mental health support.
At least 17,000 children in the Gaza Strip have been left unaccompanied or separated, according to estimates from the UN.
“Each one has a heartbreaking story of loss and grief,” said Jonathan Crickx, spokesperson for the UN children’s agency Unicef in the Palestinian territories. Each one “is a child who is coming to terms with a horrible new reality”.
“This figure corresponds to 1% of the overall displaced population – 1.7 million people,” he told a media briefing in Geneva, via video link from Jerusalem on Friday, reports AFP.
Crickx said that tracing who the children were was proving “extremely difficult”, as sometimes they were brought to a hospital and “they simply can’t even say their names” due to shock or being injured. He said that during conflicts, it was common for extended families to take care of children who lost their parents.
However, in Gaza, “due to the sheer lack of food, water or shelter, extended families are themselves distressed and face challenges to immediately take care of another child as they themselves are struggling to cater for their own children and family”, said Crickx.
Broadly, Unicef terms separated children as those who are without their parents, while unaccompanied children are those who are separated and also without other relatives.
A female Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) employee has been killed due to Israeli gunfire towards the organisation’s building in Khan Younis, says the humanitarian organisation.
According to Al Jazeera, the Palestinian news agency Wafa had earlier reported that three civilians were killed and three others injured on Friday, including a PRCS employee. The death of the PRCS employee, Hidaya Hamad, has now been confirmed by the organisation.

In a post on X, the PRCS said Hamad, who was the director of the youth and volunteers department in Gaza, had been at the organisation’s headquarters in Khan Younis when she was killed.
Al Jazeera said that the PRCS had reported that Israeli snipers continued to fire at the building, which shelters thousands of displaced individuals. PRCS said its teams are unable to transfer the wounded to the nearby al-Amal hospital due to the ongoing gunfire.

US president Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will join families at Dover air force base in Delaware on Friday to honour three US service members killed in a drone attack in Jordan, reports AP.
The deaths were the first US fatalities blamed on Iran-backed militia groups in the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war began. Biden vowed on Thursday to never forget their sacrifice to the nation and said they “risked it all”.
Defence secretary Lloyd Austin and CQ Brown, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, will join the Bidens for the transfer in Dover, where such events take place when US service members are killed in action. They will also meet with the families privately ahead of the dignified transfer.
The service members killed Sunday were all from Georgia – Sgt William Jerome Rivers of Carrollton, Sgt Kennedy Sanders of Waycross and Sgt Breonna Moffett of Savannah. Sanders and Moffett were posthumously promoted to sergeant rank.
Israel and Hamas appear to be inching closer towards a deal for a ceasefire and a release of some of the hostages still being held by the militant group in Gaza, while the UN children’s agency has warned that 17,000 children have been left without families or been separated from them by the conflict.

However, while an aide to Hamas’s political leader said the group had received details of the proposed deal, it had yet to deliver a reply.
A Qatari official later clarified to Reuters that there was “no deal yet” and that although “Hamas has received the proposal positively”, Qatar was “waiting for their response”.
Taher al-Nono, an adviser to the Qatar-based Hamas politburo chief, Ismail Haniyeh, said: “We cannot say the current stage of negotiation is zero and at the same time we cannot say that we have reached an agreement.”
Haniyeh was expected to travel to Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials on the issue of a ceasefire.

Vital supplies of fuel and bread flour for Gaza risk running dry, while schools, clinics and even rubbish collections in the West Bank and three countries across the Middle East could cease operating by the end of the month if funding cuts for UNRWA are not restored, the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees has warned.
In Gaza, where the UN has warned of an imminent famine affecting 2 million people, UNRWA delivers flour to make bread, and fuel for desalination plants, and runs networks of warehouses and lorries for aid. UNWRA-run schools have transformed into shelters housing tens of thousands of people.
UNRWA also runs hundreds of schools in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. If the agency completely stops operating, these schools would close, leaving an estimated 500,000 children without education.
Other aid agencies in Gaza that are dependent on UNRWA for coordinating aid supplies would struggle to cope if it stopped functioning.
“They all rely in one way or another on UNRWA,” said Juliette Touma, head of communications for UNRWA. “For example, Unicef brings in children’s vaccines, but the people who administer them, who put the jab in kids’ arms, are UNRWA nurses.”
Twelve donor states suspended funding after accusations that 12 of its staff took part in the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel. The agency currently estimates that the donor suspensions have cost it at least $440m.

This diagram shows the extent of damage inflicted on the Gaza Strip by Israeli military forces between 7 October and 29 January.
Images from today show that the bombardment of the Gaza Strip continues.
Reuters has spoken to displaced Palestinians in Rafah about their struggles to communicate with loved ones due to the unreliable communications in the Gaza Strip since Israel began its military campaign.
Gaza’s phone network, run by local provider Paltel, has reported more than ten total collapses in service provision since 7 October which it has attributed to Israel’s offensive. Even when its network has been partly working, it has said, it has struggled to maintain service in many areas because of the fighting.
Ahmed Abu Daka had walked a long way from his tent in Rafah to a rise where an Egyptian network connection was reachable.
“The internet is really weak. Sometimes you wait hours to send only one message,” he said.
“I wait for a long time, sometimes an hour, waiting for a message from family and relatives trapped in Nasser hospital, to be reassured about them. We wait for hours to be reassured about them, check on them and know about the danger surrounding them,” he said.
Mariam Odeh said she had been separated from parts of her family who stayed in Khan Younis.
“We want to communicate with our relatives, reassure them and tell them we are still alive. What shall I say? I cry for this situation we’re facing,” she said.
“Every day we come to the Egyptian border to call our relatives because when they call there is no service, even in Rafah. When they call us they can’t connect,” she said.
“We call them to reassure them about us, that we are alive. That we are not martyred like the others.”
Israeli security forces have continued to limit the number of people able to worship at the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem for Friday prayers.
Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that Israeli forces “searched many worshippers, restricting their access to the Old City and preventing them from reaching al-Aqsa mosque … military checkpoints were erected … [and] a significant number of worshippers had to perform Friday prayers near the Asbat Gate, one of the main gates of the holy site, and in the Ras al-Amoud neighbourhood, having been denied access.”
It is the 17th consecutive week that restrictions on worship have been imposed.
The latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 112 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes and 148 were injured in the past 24 hours.
According to the statement, at least 27,131 Palestinians have been killed and 66,287 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October.
The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.
Belgium’s ministry of foreign affairs has summoned the Israeli ambassador to Belgium and strongly condemned the bombing of the Belgian development agency Enable.
Idit Rosenzweig-Abu, the Israeli ambassador to Belgium, told the Guardian:
Israel have been notified by the Belgian MFA on this incident yesterday at 22:00 (23:00 Israel time).

The latest pro-Palestine march of hundreds of thousands of protesters through central London will end with a rally near Downing Street after a climbdown from the Metropolitan police.
Following a meeting late on Thursday afternoon, organisers of the march said they had been given permission for the end stage of Saturday’s demonstration to take place on Whitehall.
Just hours earlier the Met had insisted that the “scale and frequency of marches” was causing serious disruption and that they did not support a request to extend the march into Whitehall.
The UK could officially recognise a Palestinian state after a ceasefire in Gaza without waiting for the outcome of what could be years of talks between Israel and the Palestinians on a two-state solution, the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, has said.

Sweden’s intelligence service said on Friday that the investigation into a foiled attack on the Israeli embassy in Stockholm this week was being treated as a potential “terrorist crime”, reports AFP.
Police were called to the embassy on Wednesday after a “dangerous object” was discovered on its grounds, which the national bomb squad destroyed after determining it was “live”. Police declined to comment on what the object was but media have reported it was a hand grenade.
“The preliminary investigation launched by the Swedish police authority on 31 January, following the discovery of a dangerous object at the Israeli embassy in Stockholm, has been taken over by the Swedish Security Service,” the service said in a statement.
“In connection with this, the criminal classification has been changed to a terrorist crime,” it added. The Israeli ambassador to Sweden, Ziv Nevo Kulman, said in a post to X that the embassy had been “subject to an attempted attack”. “We will not be intimidated by terror,” Kulman added.
Today we were subject to an attempted attack against the Embassy of Israel in Stockholm and its employees. We thank the Swedish authorities for their swift response. We will not be intimidated by terror.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 105 people were killed overnight, while the Hamas press office reported Israeli air and artillery bombardment around Khan Younis – southern Gaza’s main city and the focus of recent fighting.
AFP reports that leaflets calling on civilians to leave had again been dropped by Israeli aircraft over al-Shifa hospital’s compound.
Nearly four months of fighting had left Gaza “uninhabitable”, the UN said, while the Israeli siege had resulted in dire shortages of food, water, fuel and medicines.
Fighting in Gaza raged on Friday with scores reported killed overnight, after Qatar said Hamas had given its “initial” support to a hostage-prisoner exchange deal that would pause its war with Israel, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).
After a truce proposal agreed with Israeli negotiators was presented to Hamas on Thursday, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said there were hopes of “good news” about a fresh pause to the fighting “in the next couple of weeks”.
Ansari said a truce plan thrashed out with Israeli negotiators by Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators in Paris earlier this week had received a “positive” initial response from Hamas. “That proposal has been approved by the Israeli side and now we have an initial positive confirmation from the Hamas side,” he said.
But a source close to Hamas told AFP: “There is no agreement on the framework of the agreement yet – the factions have important observations – and the Qatari statement is rushed and not true.”
A Hamas source told AFP that the group had been presented with a three-stage plan which would start with an initial six-week halt to the fighting to allow more aid deliveries into Gaza.
“Women, children and sick men over 60” among the Israeli hostages would also be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, the source told AFP, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks.
There would also be “negotiations around the withdrawal of Israeli forces”, with possible additional phases involving more prisoner exchanges.

US House to vote next week on standalone $17.6bn bill for aid to Israel,2024-02-03,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/03/us-house-israel-aid-package-mike-johnson,"Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for the package without addressing aid to Ukraine or security for the US-Mexico border
The US House of Representatives plans to vote next week to advance $17.6bn in military aid to Israel without any accompanying spending cuts or assistance for Ukraine, according to Mike Johnson, the chamber’s speaker.
Johnson announced to his fellow House Republicans on Saturday that the vote would take place, while also criticizing a parallel move in the US Senate to pair funding for Israel in its military strikes in Gaza with aid for Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion. The Senate measure also aims to attach a raft of tough border and asylum measures favored by rightwingers to aid for Israel.
A compromise on these various aims had been sought by a bipartisan group in the Senate that hoped to find increasingly rare common ground between Republicans and Democrats. But Johnson, a hardline rightwing Republican from north-western Louisiana, has said the Senate package would not pass the House because it is not sufficiently tough on people trying to cross the US’s southern border with Mexico.
“Their leadership is aware that by failing to include the House in their negotiations, they have eliminated the ability for swift consideration of any legislation,” Johnson wrote of members of the US Senate in his letter to his House Republican colleagues. “Next week, we will take up and pass a clean, standalone Israel supplemental package.”
A higher priority for Johnson is the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, with a House vote expected next week. Some Republicans have expressed reluctance to find a compromise on immigration or Ukraine given how ongoing controversy on these issues could aid Donald Trump, who holds a single-minded grip over his party as he seeks another presidency in this year’s election.
It’s unclear whether the Senate would advance a bill that only provides military aid to Israel to further pursue its war against Hamas, an effort that has already reduced much of Gaza to rubble and caused a humanitarian crisis among the Palestinian population.
The Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, has said he would prefer to work on an overall package that aids Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression – as well as Israel and includes a set of new immigration curbs.
The Joe Biden White House has also signaled that it is not in favor of an Israel aid-only bill. In November, John Kirby, a spokesperson for Biden’s national security council, said that the president would veto a bill that only provides aid to Israel.
Congressman Brad Schneider, who has been a vocal supporter of Israel, also spoke out against the bill in a statement on Saturday.
“Israel is fighting an existential war against Hamas – a nihilistic, genocidal terrorist army – while also being attacked by Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] and Iranian proxies in Syria, Houthis in Yemen, and terror cells in the West Bank. There is no question the United States must support our ally Israel, and I will vote yes for the clean supplemental appropriation.

“But it is folly to think that what is happening now in the Middle East is unrelated to what is happening concurrently in Ukraine. If Putin wins in Europe, the aid we are providing Israel today is only a small fraction of what will be needed when Israel faces a strengthened Hezbollah, backed by an emboldened Iran and newly empowered Russia.”
He continued: “It is also folly to not provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinian civilians caught in the middle of the war in Gaza. Israel has opened Karem Shalom crossing and is allowing trucks to cross the border. We need to help aid get from the crossings to the people who need it, and ensure it is kept away from the thieving hands of Hamas. Sadly, the House GOP is again turning a blind eye.
“It is shameful that Speaker Johnson and the House GOP refuse to step up and ensure the United States continues to lead and support our allies in their time of need.”

‘Everything beautiful has been destroyed’: Palestinians mourn a city in tatters,2024-02-04,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/04/everything-beautiful-has-been-destroyed-palestinians-mourn-a-city-in-tatters,"More than 200 buildings of cultural and historical significance have been reduced to rubble in Gaza, including mosques, cemeteries and museums
Its walls collapsed and its minaret cut short, Gaza’s Omari mosque remains standing but vastly diminished. Around it, the historic old city is also in tatters. The 7th-century mosque, also known as the Great Mosque of Gaza, was Gaza’s most famous and its surroundings a focal point of the Palestinian enclave’s history and culture, but the damage done to its heritage over more than 100 days of Israeli bombardment spreads across the city.
For the few Palestinians who remain, and the far greater number displaced and hoping to return, the culture and history has been reduced to memories.
“The city is a ghost town, people walk around with pale faces and their spirits are tired after having gone through this war. If you walk to the old city of Gaza, you will only remember the memories and feel sickened and saddened by the amount of destruction of cultural and religious sites,” said Bader Alzaharna, who lives in Gaza City despite the intensity of Israel’s ground operation in the area.
“The old city of Gaza, which used to be full of cultural sites, is grey and overcast. Walking in Gaza feels like we are in a movie, in a fictional story, in a fantasy. The scene is apocalyptic.”
Unesco, the UN agency responsible for protecting culture, says it has verified damage to at least 22 sites, including mosques, churches, historical homes, universities, archives and the archeological site of Anthedon Harbour, Gaza’s first known seaport.
The agency said it had received reports of damage to other sites but had not been able to verify them through the means available, mainly satellite imagery, because of the conflict.
A recent report by the Palestinian culture ministry into Israeli damage to Palestinian heritage said Israel’s bombardment of Gaza had destroyed 207 buildings of cultural or historical significance, including 144 in the old city and 25 religious sites.
The damage has also included an ancient Roman cemetery and the Commonwealth war cemetery, where more than 3,000 British and commonwealth soldiers are buried after dying in battles during the first and second world wars.
Unesco has warned that more sites are at risk of damage, including one of the region’s oldest Christian monasteries, the Saint Hilarion complex, which it said had not been damaged yet but was in an area of intense fighting.
“Unesco is deeply concerned about damage of cultural and historical sites in Gaza. While humanitarian emergencies are a legitimate priority, the protection of cultural heritage in all its forms – as well as the protection of educational infrastructures and journalists – must also be ensured, in accordance with international law, which stipulates that cultural property is civilian infrastructure,” the agency said.
Wissam Nassar, a photographer who covered several wars in Gaza but also documented its culture, said the damage to the Omari mosque and its surroundings had hit him personally due to the time he spent there.
“This mosque holds a special place for every Palestinian in Gaza, as it was a gathering point during Ramadan and a place for worship and Quranic readings. As a photographer, it has a special significance for me, capturing many moments and memories inside this mosque,” said Nassar.
Nassar, who now lives in Canada, said he remembers visiting the old city, including the now-destroyed Turkish baths, both as a photographer and in his personal life. He said the damage to Christian sites, such as the Saint Porphyrius Orthodox church complex, near the Omari mosque, also damaged Gaza’s diversity.
“As a photographer I will carry sadness throughout my life because these historical buildings are difficult to restore, and their loss is irreplaceable. I will remember them in every moment, as we have thousands of memories within these places. However, the greater sorrow will be felt when I look at the pictures I took inside these archaeological sites.”
“Unfortunately, Israel destroyed everything beautiful in Gaza. Israel aimed to destroy not only people but also stones, infrastructure and historical buildings, wanting to eradicate human life and cultural heritage.”
South Africa’s case at the international court of justice in the Hague accusing Israel of genocide, which led to the court to order Israel to prevent its troops carrying out acts that could amount to genocide, included claims that Israel had targeted Palestinian culture.
It also accused Israel of destroying modern museums and cultural centres and threatening Gaza’s “cultural potential” through damage to schools, as well as the killing of journalists, teachers and intellectuals.
Isber Sabrine, head of the Heritage for Peace NGO, said the damage done to Gaza’s heritage would be lasting and reached far beyond physical buildings. That done to religious sites, he said, would affect the social life of both Muslims and Christians and would take a long time to rehabilitate.
“The destruction of heritage in Gaza is also the destruction of traditions, it’s also the destruction of their habits, of their culture,” said Sabrine.
“It’s a huge destruction of heritage to intentionally disconnect the people of Gaza from their land. It’s important to preserve and restore. When the war stops there will be a need to evaluate what is destroyed.”

"Until Israelis and Palestinians see more than a ‘faceless enemy’, there can be no peace | Samir El-Youssef",2024-02-05,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/05/israel-palestine-faceless-enemy-peace-violence,"Each side must realise it has dehumanised the other to the extent that extremes of violence have been justified
One question has been frequently asked since the beginning of the Hamas-Israel war: “What will happen when hostilities end in Gaza?” And the only positive answer thus far has been a call to resume peace negotiations endorsing a two-state solution. This solution, it’s been claimed, is the only way to prevent what happened on and since 7 October from ever happening again.
The hope of establishing a Palestine state alongside the existing state of Israel is not impossible to achieve as long as sincere efforts are made by all concerned parties. According to Gordon Brown, such hope was actually within inches of being reached during his premiership in 2008. But would that have been sufficient to bring about a lasting solution?
Thirty years ago, Palestinian and Israeli leaders began peace negotiations that resulted in the Oslo accords of 1993, and the ensuing peace process. But this was only the conclusion of a reluctant realisation that Palestinians and Israelis could no longer deny the right of the other side to exist. Palestinians could no longer consider the state of Israel as merely a “Zionist entity”, the destruction of which was their national duty. Nor could Israelis ignore the fact that Palestinians, represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), constitute a nation with undeniable aspirations for self-determination and statehood.
Thus mutual recognition was reached within the limits of this apparently realistic and pragmatic realisation. This allowed talks to take place between leaders, but neither society progressed beyond that fleeting moment of acceptance. There should have been practical plans for education and collaboration between both, the bringing together of institutions and organisations and lives to the point that even if things went wrong, no excessive or indiscriminate use of violence could be tolerated by either society.
I believe that what happened on 7 October and henceforth is the result of the failure of the peace process to change the long-held perceptions by Palestinian and Israeli societies. Namely, that those of the other side are no more trustworthy than the presence of a faceless enemy.
A few days after Hamas’s attack, a chilling comparison was made: the highest number of Jews had been killed in one day since the Holocaust, invoking what is, in the west, considered the gravest of crimes against humanity. I tried to use this statement to explain to friends in Gaza why British political leaders, from both government and opposition, declared unreserved support for whatever the Israeli government deemed a proper response. I soon realised, however, that if the significance of such a statement had been obvious for the people of Gaza, Hamas’s outrageous attack could have never been tolerated. Nor might it possibly have been committed in the first place.
Around the same time, the Egyptian-American comedian Bassem Youssef wondered sarcastically about the victims’ “rate of exchange” this time round; how many Palestinians must lose their lives for every single Israeli victim? Youssef, whose wife is a Palestinian from Gaza, aimed to show that he was wary of Israelis’ predictable use of disproportionate force as collective punishment. Israel had previously used such excessive force that now, in order to keep up with its past measures, it would perhaps have to use nuclear weapons against Gaza. And this is what an Israeli cabinet minister did actually suggest.
Why do Israeli military forces and Palestinian militants find it morally unquestionable to slaughter the other’s civilian population? Because both societies still see those on the opposite side as merely a faceless enemy, which means a dehumanised enemy, an enemy such that even destroying its civilian population could not pose a moral dilemma. Thus the Israeli defence minister called Palestinians in Gaza animals whose total annihilation should represent no moral difficulty. And Hamas fighters had no qualms about opening fire on a crowd of partygoers, killing no fewer than 250 of them. Nor did they hesitate to take children and elderly women as hostages.
The disastrous ongoing war is itself proof that Palestinians and Israelis cannot live in peace side by side without learning first that those on the opposite side are a society suffering harsh reality, or a traumatic past, or both. Such learning, however, requires more than crude political agreements for “two states” with secure borders.
Although this appears to be among the darkest moments in the long history of the conflict, hopes for peace often arise out of such tragedies. From some Palestinians and Israelis, the frustration is getting deeper, and the desire for revenge has all but abated. It is in the voice of the rational, honest and brave minority that hope for a peaceful future is to be discerned. Most of my friends in Gaza believe that in attacking Israel, Hamas has taken a disastrous risk, showing little regard for consequences, and the fate of Gazan civilians. And there are Israelis who haven’t shied from the truth that their government’s constant rejection of calls for a ceasefire is driven by no other motive than its own survival.
Politics, especially politics in Palestine-Israel, is far too important to be left to politicians alone, especially the kind of politicians who have been in charge on both sides for at least the past 20 years. The main concern, not to say the only concern, of political leaders is their own survival. Palestinian and Israeli societies, on the other hand, are the ones who are paying the heavy price of the devastating violence that has been carried out for more than three months now.
It is surely the responsibility of both societies to take the first courageous step and lift the veil of denial and face the shameful truth. Both sides must realise that they have dehumanised one another to the extent that it “permitted” them to unleash extreme uses of violence. Both societies, with their civil institutions and organisations, groups and individuals, must no longer exempt themselves from the responsibility of what has been happening. Nor should they accept remaining alienated from what directly concerns their present and future life and survival. The alternative could be a perpetual state of war even if the “two-state solution” became a reality.

Middle East crisis: Drone strike in Syria reported to have killed six members of US-backed Kurdish-led group – as it happened,2024-02-05,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/05/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-latest-israel-strikes-gaza-unrwa-funding-palestine-hamas-hostage-deal-blinken-saudi-arabia-visit,"Six members of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have reportedly been killed at a base which also houses US forces
In the first significant attack in Syria or Iraq since the US launched strikes over the weekend against Iran-backed militias that have been targeting its forces in the region, six allied Kurdish fighters were killed late Sunday by a drone attack on a base also housing US troops in eastern Syria.
Associated Press reports the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said Monday the attack hit a training ground at al-Omar base in Syria’s eastern province of Deir el-Zour, where the forces’ commando units are trained. No casualties were reported among US troops.
The SDF initially accused “Syrian regime-backed mercenaries” of carrying out Sunday’s attack but in a second statement blamed “Iran-backed militias” after investigating the attack. An umbrella group of Iran-backed Iraqi militias, dubbed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, released a video claiming responsibility and showing them launching a drone from an unspecified location. Iraq and Syria share 600km (370m) of border.
Britain-based opposition war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed at least seven SDF fighters were killed in the attack on Sunday, and at least 18 others wounded, some in critical condition.
The SDF said it has the right to respond to the attack.
The US strikes on Saturday came after three of its service personnel were killed in a drone strike on a US base in Jordan on 27 January. Two US defense officials told CNN at the weekend that during those strikes “all but one of the 85 targets were ‘destroyed or functionally damaged’”.

US secretary of state Antony Blinken arrived in Saudi Arabia on his fifth visit to the region since October in the coming hours. He will visit Israel as well as Egypt and Qatar. Speaking Monday after meeting in Washington with Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Blinken said there was “real hope” for success of a “good, strong [ceasefire] proposal”. Jake Sullivan, president Joe Biden’s national security adviser, said Blinken would press Israel to allow more food, water, medicine and shelter in to Gaza, which has been left in rubble by nearly four months of bombardment.
In its latest operational update the Israeli military claims it has killed “dozens of terrorists” in the central and northern Gaza Strip in the last 24 hours. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that Israeli bombardment continues in Khan Younis, with large areas east of the city of Deir al-Balah also being targeted. At least 20 Palestinians were killed over the weekend in Israeli strikes on Rafah, the city previously designated a safe zone by the Israeli military and to where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had fled, according to the UN agency humanitarian agency OCHA.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society has reported on social media that Israeli forces have detained the general manager and the administrative director of the Al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis.
A 14-year-old Palestinian child was shot dead by Israeli security forces near occupied East Jerusalem after what they claimed was an attempted stabbing attack.
Spain will send the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA an additional €3.5m (£3m / $3.8m) in aid, foreign minister José Manuel Albares told lawmakers on Monday. The agency has warned of a significant funding shortfall after several large donors suspended funding after Israel accused 12 UNRWA employees of participating in the 7 October Hamas attack inside southern Israel.
Russia summoned Israel’s ambassador in Moscow over comments Simona Halperin made in an interview. She had criticised Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov for playing down the importance of the Holocaust and said Russia was being too friendly with Hamas.

At least 27,478 Palestinians have been killed and 66,835 have been wounded by Israeli military action in Gaza since 7 October, Reuters reports the health ministry in Gaza said on Monday.
The ministry, which is run by Hamas, does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in the death toll.
Earlier we reported that at least six US-backed Kurdish fighters had been killed in a drone strike on a US base in eastern Syria. Patrick Wintour has more details …
At least six US-backed Kurdish fighters have been killed in a drone strike on a US base in eastern Syria claimed by Iranian-backed militia that on Friday was the target of US airstrikes.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI), among the subjects of a US-led attack last week in reprisal for its killing of three US soldiers in a drone strike on a US base in Jordan, said it was responsible. The group is a loose alliance of pro-Iran fighters opposed to US presence in Syria and Iraq.
Al-Omar is the largest base in Syria of a US-led coalition including the SDF that was set up in 2014 to beat back IS after the Sunni jihadists captured swathes of Iraq and neighbouring Syria.
Operating under the banner of Operation Inherent Resolve, about 2,500 US troops are still deployed in Iraq and about 900 in Syria, where Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, still does not control large tracts of the country since the civil war that began in 2011.
The Syrian Defence Forces are the de facto army of the Kurdish administration that control an area of Syria’s north-east they call Rojava.

US secretary of state Antony Blinken has arrived in Saudi Arabia, Reuters reports. In Riyadh, Blinken is expected to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as his Saudi counterpart, foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.
It is Blinken’s fifth visit to the region since the 7 October attack by Hamas inside southern Israel. Blinken is also set to visit Egypt, Qatar and Israel later this week in an attempt to secure a pause in fighting that will allow hostages to be released. Hamas is believed to still have about 136 people in captivity in Gaza, not all of whom are believed to still be alive.
In recent days the US has carried out strikes inside Syria, Iraq and Yemen on targets it says are Iran-backed militants.
In July 2022, US president Joe Biden visited Saudi Arabia, and said afterwards he told the crown prince that he held him personally responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The Biden administration later ruled that the crown prince enjoyed head-of-state immunity from any decision by an American court on the murder of the journalist, who had been living in exile in the US before his death.
Israeli police have published footage showing what they say was an attempted stabbing attack earlier today near Israeli-occupied al-Eizariya in the West Bank. Police shot dead the 14-year-old during the incident. Palestinian news agency Wafa identified the child as Wadee Oweisat from Jabal al-Mukkaber, near occupied East Jerusalem.
Ofri Bibs, the aunt of the two youngest Israeli hostages held in Gaza, said at a committee session in the Knesset today that “it is important to me to remind that behind the posters and the pictures that we bring with us and that appear all over the country, which we a little bit got used to seeing, there are people.”
“I think that, if there’s someone who hasn’t understood it yet, we don’t have another way to bring them except a deal,” she insisted.

Spain will send the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA an additional €3.5m (£3m / $3.8m) in aid, Reuters reports foreign minister José Manuel Albares told lawmakers on Monday.
The agency has warned of a significant funding shortfall after several large donors suspended funding after Israel accused 12 UNRWA employees of participating in the 7 October Hamas attack inside southern Israel.
Madrid contributed €18.5m (£15.8m / $19.9m) directly to UNRWA in 2023, including €10m (£8.5 / $10.75m) approved in December in the wake of the worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory since Israel commenced its military assault there.
Citing security sources and the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society, news agency Wafa reports that Israel has detained another 22 Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Describing the raids as a “large-scale military incursion” across the territory, Wafa reports nearly 6,540 Palestinians have been detained since 7 October.
Al Jazeera has a report from Mohammed R Mhawish who has remained in Gaza City with his family throughout the Israeli assault on the territory. He writes:
My family – father, mother, sister, wife, and two-year-old son – and I are seeking relative refuge in the parking garage of a destroyed apartment building. On rainy nights, I take off my coat and wrap it around my baby, making it both a blanket and protection for him against the cold, with hope and prayer that it will be enough for his small body.
Beyond shelter is the struggle for food. I cannot recall the last proper meal my son had. Wheat is nowhere to be found so we have been using animal feed-grade barley and corn to grind into flour for bread.
If you secure food, you still have to cook it and, with no cooking gas, people are combing the ruins to find anything they can burn for a cooking fire, exposing themselves to bombing at any time. And so, when every hour of the day is spent either looking for food or a means to make it, we cannot always worry about staying safe.
In Russia, Tass reports that “the Israeli ambassador will be summoned to the Russian foreign ministry in connection with unacceptable public statements.”
Reuters notes that in an interview in Russia’s Kommersant, published on Sunday, Simona Halperin criticised Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov for playing down the importance of the Holocaust and said Russia was being too friendly with Hamas.
In October, two-and-a-half weeks after the 7 October attack, Moscow received a delegation from Hamas. Hamas subsequently released two Russian-Israeli dual nationals it had seized from southern Israel as hostages, under a separate hostage release agreement negotiated between Hamas and Russia.
The ministry described Halperin’s comments as “an extremely unsuccessful start” to her diplomatic posting, which began last December.
In its latest operational update the Israeli military claims it has killed “dozens of terrorists” in the central and northern Gaza Strip in the last 24 hours.
It says that in the west of Khan Younis its troops “continue to kill terror operatives in battles”. It claims to have “conducted targeted raids on terrorist targets and located weapons including AK-47 rifles, sniper rifles, grenades, and ammunition”.
Al Jazeera reports that the Al-Quds Brigades belonging to Islamic Jihad in Gaza claims to have engaged Israeli troops “on the frontlines of the city of Khan Younis” using “anti-personnel bombs”.
It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify casualty figures being issued during the conflict.

Middle East crisis: Netanyahu rejects Hamas ceasefire proposal and vows to fight until ‘total victory’,2024-02-07,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/07/middle-east-crisis-live-diplomatic-push-to-secure-gaza-ceasefire-as-hamas-responds-to-plan,"This live blog is now closed. For more on Netanyahu’s comments, you can read our latest report:
Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected Hamas demands for a ceasefire in Gaza and vowed to press ahead with Israel’s military offensive in Gaza until achieving “total victory”.
The Israeli prime minister, in a news conference shortly after meeting US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Israel was within reach of achieving total victory “in a matter of months”.
Netanyahu pledged to destroy Hamas, and ruled out any arrangement that leaves the Palestinian militant group in full or partial control of Gaza.
Israel is the “only power” capable of guaranteeing security in the long term, he said, adding:
The day after is the day after Hamas. All of Hamas.
Hamas put forward its own far-reaching proposal for a permanent end to the fighting late on Tuesday via Qatari and Egyptian mediators, detailing a three-phase plan to unfold over four and a half months.
The plan, in response to a proposal drawn up by the US, Israel, Qatar and Egypt, stipulates that all hostages would be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, including senior militants, and an end to the war.
Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has rejected Hamas demands for a ceasefire in Gaza and vowed to press ahead with Israel’s military offensive in Gaza until achieving “total victory”. Israel was within reach of achieving total victory “in a matter of months”, Netanyahu said at a news conference shortly after meeting US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. “The day after is the day after Hamas. All of Hamas.”
Hamas laid out a detailed three-phase plan to unfold over four and a half months late on Tuesday via Qatari and Egyptian mediators, responding to a proposal drawn up by the US, Israel, Qatar and Egypt. The plan stipulates that all hostages would be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, including senior militants, and an end to the war.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said “a lot of work” remained to be done to bridge the gap between Israel and Hamas on terms for a new ceasefire and hostage-release deal. Blinken met with Netanyahu and Israeli president Isaac Herzog on Wednesday, during which he reiterated US support for “the establishment of a Palestinian state as the best way to ensure lasting peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike and greater integration for the region”, according to a US State department readout.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said he is “especially alarmed” by reports that the Israeli military intends to focus next on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. His comments came amid concerns of an “imminent” Israel ground invasion of Rafah as Israeli gunboats reportedly fired on the main coastal road to the west of the city on Wednesday morning. “Such an action would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences,” Guterres warned.
At least 27,708 Palestinians have been killed and 67,147 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures by the Gaza health ministry on Wednesday. The figures includes 123 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes and 169 injured in the past 24 hours.
Saudi Arabia has said there will be “no diplomatic relations with Israel unless an independent Palestinian state is recognised”. A Saudi foreign ministry statement on Wednesday reiterated “its call to the permanent members of the UN security council that have not yet recognised the Palestinian state, to expedite the recognition of the Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital”.
Israeli protesters have prevented trucks carrying humanitarian aid from entering Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing on Wednesday, according an Israeli defence body. The group behind the protests has demanded freedom for the Israeli hostages in Gaza before further aid is allowed into the besieged Palestinian territory.
Israel’s military has said it discovered and destroyed a tunnel used by senior Hamas leaders and to hold hostages in southern Gaza’s main city of Khan Younis. Israeli special forces unearthed what they said was a “strategic underground tunnel” stretching more than one kilometre (just over half a mile) in a “targeted raid”. The city has been the focus of intense bombardment in recent weeks.
Human Rights Watch has urged EU donors to restore funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) amid warnings that it could cease operations across the Middle East by the end of the month. The rights group said it was “unconscionable” to consider shutting down the UN agency amid a “desperate” humanitarian situation in Gaza.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israel the “biggest antisemitic massacre of our century” as he led a ceremony paying tribute to the French victims. The ceremony, the first major international memorial event outside Israel since the Hamas attacks four months ago, remembered the 42 French citizens killed in the attacks and the three others still missing, believed to be held hostage.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians crammed into the small southern Gaza border city of Rafah are being forced to contemplate being displaced once more as an Israeli offensive looms.
Those who fled to the border city, almost half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, face a terrifying choice: stay in overcrowded Rafah – once home to 280,000 people – and wait for the attack, or risk moving north through an area of continued fighting.
Large areas are occupied by tented encampments, which have encroached even on some of Rafah’s cemeteries. Aid officials have described the city as a “pressure cooker of despair”, warning that a full-scale Israeli offensive on an area so overcrowded could cause large-scale loss of civilian life, and could be a war crime.
While Rafah has been hit by Israeli strikes throughout the war, the bombing and Israeli troops have been edging ever closer to the city, whose southern boundary is delineated by the mainly closed border with Egypt.
Fears of an imminent Israeli assault have been increased by strikes closer to Rafah, including by Israeli gunboats that shelled the western road into the city on Wednesday.
Describing the mood this week, Raed al-Nims, the media director of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza, said: “Everyone is afraid of the expanding of the ground operation in Rafah.”
The growing sense of desperation has been underlined by the fact that some of the few who have tried to leave the city for areas such as Nuseirat, central Gaza, in recent days have lost contact with family members.
Most families who spoke to the Guardian this week indicated they would wait for an Israeli military evacuation order in the hope it would designate a safe exit route in the event of a full-scale assault.

A Hamas delegation, headed by senior Hamas official Khalil Al-Hayya, will travel to Cairo on Thursday to pursue ceasefire talks with Egypt and Qatar, a Hamas official has said.
A senior Hamas official has responded to Benjamin Netanyahu’s news conference, saying the Israeli prime minister has showed that he intends to pursue conflict in the Middle East.
Netanyahu’s comments were “a form of political bravado, indicating his intention to pursue the conflict in the region”, Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters.
Hamas was “prepared to deal with all the options”, he added.
Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected Hamas demands for a ceasefire in Gaza and vowed to press ahead with Israel’s military offensive in Gaza until achieving “total victory”.
The Israeli prime minister, in a news conference shortly after meeting US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Israel was within reach of achieving total victory “in a matter of months”.
Netanyahu pledged to destroy Hamas, and ruled out any arrangement that leaves the Palestinian militant group in full or partial control of Gaza.
Israel is the “only power” capable of guaranteeing security in the long term, he said, adding:
The day after is the day after Hamas. All of Hamas.
Hamas put forward its own far-reaching proposal for a permanent end to the fighting late on Tuesday via Qatari and Egyptian mediators, detailing a three-phase plan to unfold over four and a half months.
The plan, in response to a proposal drawn up by the US, Israel, Qatar and Egypt, stipulates that all hostages would be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, including senior militants, and an end to the war.
Netanyahu says Israel must bring “absolute victory”, which means eliminating Hamas, a complete dismantling of all their battalions, and destroying the entire underground tunnel network.
He says he has “grappled with a number of prominent peace agreements”, and that he believes there will be a deal.
But we will not manage to reach those agreements and those peace treaties and normalisation without beating Hamas.
Netanyahu also calls for the replacement of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
He says Israel believes that up to 60% of humanitarian aid going into Gaza is being taken by Hamas, and that he has instructed officials to find a solution that would prevent that from happening.
Asked about demands put forward by Hamas to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages, Netanyahu says Israel has not “committed to anything”.
We haven’t committed to … really enormous numbers that they’re talking about … of terrorists that we are to release. There are supposed to be some kind of process of negotiations with the mediators, but from what I’ve seen after the response of Hamas, I don’t know what is happening.
Netanyahu says he told the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, that Israel will ensure that the Gaza Strip will be demilitarised forever after Hamas is eliminated.
Not part of Hamas, not half of Hamas, but the entire Hamas.
Israel Defense Forces will act “wherever and at any time that is necessary” in Gaza, the Israeli prime minister says.
Benjamin Netanyahu begins his news conference by saying that Israel is on its way to a “decisive” victory, adding that it is “in our hands … in a matter of months”.
The Israeli prime minister says the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are working systematically and will achieve all the objectives of the war: to release all the hostages and eliminate Hamas. He says the IDF’s achievements have been “unprecedented”.
“We do not come back until we win,” he says, adding:
I would like to emphasise once again – there is no other solution other than complete and decisive victory.
Israel’s prime minster, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to hold a news conference in Jerusalem in the next few minutes.
It comes after Netanyahu held talks with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, after Hamas put towards its proposal for a new ceasefire and hostage-release deal.
Israeli protesters have prevented trucks carrying humanitarian aid from entering Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing, according to Cogat, an Israeli defence body in charge of Palestinian civilian affairs.
No trucks were able to enter through the crossing on Wednesday, Cogat said, although the Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza was working as normal.

Human rights groups denounce failed Senate deal on border policies and foreign aid – as it happened,2024-02-07,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/feb/07/congress-ukraine-israel-aid-trump-haley-campaign-politics-updates,"This live blog is now closed. For the latest on the Senate bill, read our most recent report:
The failed bipartisan compromise bill that paired US “border security” provisions with billions in military aid for Ukraine and Israel had been sharply criticized by advocacy groups that support immigrant rights and human rights.
“Immigrants are essential members of our communities who move the country forward. Throwing immigrants under the bus in exchange for short-term, unrelated foreign aid is an enormous political and moral miscalculation,” Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center and the NILC Immigrant Justice Fund, said in a statement in response to the bill’s failure. Matos criticized Democrats for making a bipartisan deal with Republicans on border policy, arguing “It has long been clear that Republicans in Congress were never serious about resolving the issues in our immigration system and are only interested in weaponizing fear to score political points.”
Amnesty International had also denounced the now-failed bipartisan compromise, saying it included “the most extreme anti-immigrant proposals this country has seen in 100 years” and that the policies were “draconian and antithetical to human rights” and “will only lead to more suffering, more cruelty, and more death.”

Amnesty also criticized US senate support for “billions of dollars in unconditional military and security funding” to Israel “at a moment when there’s concern about atrocities, including war crimes.”
We’re wrapping up our live politics coverage for tonight. A recap of today’s key events is below. Tomorrow, the supreme court will hear oral arguments on whether Donald Trump is eligible to run for office, a case that represents the culmination of years of work by left-leaning watchdog groups who argue that Trump’s conduct on 6 January amounts to insurrection against the US government, and should bar him from holding office.
From today:
Senate Republicans rejected a bipartisan compromise bill that combined changes in US immigration policy and additional security measures at the US-Mexico border with nearly $100bn in foreign aid, including to Ukraine and Israel.
The Biden-backed bipartisan compromise had been denounced by immigrant rights and human rights groups like Amnesty International, who called the proposals cruel, inhumane, and likely to lead to more suffering and death.
Congressional Republicans faced criticism, including from their own members, for internal dysfunction after the failure of the bipartisan border compromise bill followed the flopped House GOP attempt to impeach Democratic homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. 
Democrats are now using the GOP votes against a border deal to campaign against Republicans, arguing that party members caved to Trump, who had publicly urged them not to pass the deal. “You do not let a fire burn so that Donald Trump can campaign on the ashes,” Democratic senator Patty Murray said.
The Senate planned to move ahead with votes to advance a simpler bill that would simply provide foreign military aid to Ukraine and Israel, a measure that Biden said he would support. But as Republicans negotiated over whether they could add back in some border policy measures to the foreign aid bill, and the clocked ticked later into evening, forward movement stalled.
But independent Sen. Bernie Sanders had already said earlier he would oppose legislation to provide military aid to Israel: “Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas’s terrorism, but it does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people,” Sanders said, saying “over 27,000 Palestinians have been killed and 67,000 wounded – two-thirds of whom are women and children” since the war began.
Still waiting….
It is now nearly 5:30pm in Washington.
The Senate is still working on its 2:30p vote.

Frustration as GOP rejects a bipartisan border compromise, only to demand another 
If you’re just catching up on today’s senate Republican vote to reject a bipartisan border deal, followed by GOP demands that amendments with border provisions be allowed for a standalone foreign military aid bill, here are some perspectives:
So, to recap: Republicans demanded border provisionsToday they killed a bill that included themAnd now they’re demanding border again https://t.co/vKDWPMkDqO
Sen. Kelly: “How crazy is that? We had a bipartisan deal, they should have voted for the thing the first time.”
And from a bit earlier:
GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski said it was unclear who could trust the GOP to negotiate after they scuttled the bipartisan border bill.She told me: “I’ve gone through the multile stages of grief. Today I’m just pissed off.”
“I have a difficult time understanding again how anyone else in the future is going to want to be on that negotiating team — on anything —- if we are going to be against it,” Murkowksi added.
This is Lois Beckett, picking up our live politics coverage from Los Angeles.
We are still waiting on a vote to see whether the senate will proceed with debate over a proposed $95b military assistance bill for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.
Some details on the current conversations among Republican senators from Punchbowl News and HuffPost:
Sen. Tillis says there are some demands for an amendment vote on the Afghan Adjustment Act, which fell off the supplemental when the border piece was scrapped. He says most amendment demands are “generally with the intent of trying to pass it” in the end https://t.co/NPPK5Wk4rm
“I don’t think we need them,” Young says. “I don’t think they’ll pass and in the end, we’d have the same people voting yes and no.” https://t.co/ctBw50f9fg
The focus will shift to the US supreme court tomorrow, where justices will consider a case challenging Donald Trump’s ability to appear on presidential ballots, after advocacy groups argued his involvement in the January 6 insurrection should disqualify him. Here’s the Guardian’s Rachel Leingang with more on those efforts:
A US supreme court case that could remove Donald Trump from the 2024 presidential ballot is the culmination of several years of work by left-leaning watchdog groups to reinvigorate the 14th amendment and its power.
A Colorado case that found Trump couldn’t run for re-election there was filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), though other groups and individuals have filed lawsuits and petitions in many states trying to remove Trump under the 14th amendment’s third clause. The clause says that people who were in office and participated in an insurrection against the US can’t hold office again.
Some of the challenges have gone through the courts, while others have appealed directly to elections officials in charge of placing candidates on the ballot. Colorado was the first ruling to decide against Trump, so it is headed to the supreme court at the former president’s behest. Because of how consequential and rare the issue is, it was expected that the high court would eventually be the arbiter of how the clause applied in the modern era.
The Senate is now voting on whether to begin debate on the $95b military assistance bill for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.
That vote needs only a simple majority to succeed, but the story doesn’t end there. Fox News reports that Democrats want the measure to pass quickly, but, as with most legislation in the Senate, will need at least nine Republican votes to do that. The GOP is demanding that majority leader Chuck Schumer allow amendments be made to the bill – including some measures dealing with immigration, even after the party just a few minutes ago voted down a bill to make major changes to how the US deals with migrants and asylum seekers:
4) But Democrats don’t want Republicans to dither too long – considering the experience earlier on the border package.
5) Ironically, Democrats tell Fox that Republicans are actually insisting on BORDER AMENDMENTS for the foreign aid package – even though most Republicans JUST VOTED TO KILL THE BORDER BILL.
As we wait to find out if Republicans will vote to provide military aid to Ukraine and Israel without hardline border policies, Punchbowl News reports that a key GOP lawmaker is warning that approving the bill could hurt the party’s chances in the November elections.
That’s the argument made in a party strategy meeting by senator Steve Daines of Montana, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is tasked with winning the party seats in Congress’s upper chamber:
INSIDE THE ROOM—Sen. Daines, the NRSC chair, told Republican senators that passing the foreign aid portion without a border component would kneecap GOP candidates in key races who have been calling for no foreign aid w/o border, per two attendees.Also: Romney & Cruz got heated
Republicans are tipped to retake control of the Senate in November. For Democrats to maintain their one-seat majority, Joe Biden would have to win re-election, and the party would have to win two of the three seats they are defending representing Ohio, West Virginia and Montana – all red states. That’s assuming their lawmakers in safer seats are re-elected, and the Democrats fail to defeat Republican senators representing Texas, Florida, or any other red state.
The bipartisan bill combining an overhaul of US immigration policy and security measures at the US-Mexico border with nearly $100bn in foreign aid on Wednesday has failed to garner enough votes to move forward in the US Senate, although voting continued.
More details as they happen. There are already 49 No votes. Sixty Yes votes in the 100-strong chamber are needed to pass bills.
The White House is focused on getting a Ukraine aid package through the US Congress, the White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday, adding there was no “plan B”, Reuters reports.
We believe we still can and will deliver aid for Ukraine,” Sullivan told reporters during a joint press conference with the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg.
Stoltenberg said it was vital Congress agreed on continued support for Ukraine in the near future.
Stoltenberg said there was no imminent threat to any Nato ally, but added:
We must sustain our support and that is a responsibility for all allies.”
The US Senate is currently voting on the bipartisan border and foreign aid bill that a group of lawmakers has been working on for months and unveiled on Sunday. But the bill appears doomed, despite Republicans having insisted on immigration reform to tighten security at the US-Mexico border. Legislation needs 60 votes to pass the 100-member Senate, where Democrats hold a wafter-thin majority, so GOP support is needed to pass bills.
Arizona independent US senator Kyrsten Sinema just told the chamber that the Republican abandonment of efforts to pass immigration reform legislation was “shameful”.
Sinema (who switched from the Democratic party to become an independent not long after the midterm elections in 2022, when Republicans won control of the House), said that many Republican senators may just want to ignore a bill involving tightening border security, but Arizona could not afford that as it is dealing with the increase in migration every day.
Republican senator James Lankford of Oklahoma spoke on the floor of the Senate moments ago to say that Americans were telling Congress to “do something” about the increase in migration at the US-Mexico border.
“We have to decide if we are going to do that or not, if we are going to do nothing, or do something,” he said.
He said the bill that looks doomed is “a bill put together by a bipartisan effort – welcome to the US Senate”.
Lankford worked across the aisle with Democrats Patty Murray and Chris Murphy and independent senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to prepare the complex bill that implements immigration reforms, toughens the US-Mexico border, and funds more aid for Ukraine, Israel and allies in the Indo-Pacific region such as Taiwan. At almost 400 pages, he said it took months of complicated work.
But he said he had Republican colleagues who believed lies they read on social media rather than the text of the bill itself. One unnamed fellow GOPer told him: “If you are trying to move a bill that solves the border crisis during the election, I will do everything to destroy you,” Lankford said. And they have done so, he said, by signaling they would not support a bill Republicans had said was sorely needed.
Washington state’s Democratic senator Patty Murray is on the floor of the US Senate now, lambasting Republicans who are obstructing the border and war aid spending legislation, and thanking her Republican fellow senator, James Lankford, of Oklahoma, who just spoke passionately.
Murray talked of Ukraine’s defense against Russian president Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s offensive against Hamas, and the need for more US funds for those allies, and said: “Today is a critical vote. Today is a critical day to decide.” She asked if senators would keep their word when they negotiate with each other.
Both she and Lankford are lamenting the fact that legislation in front of the Senate to implement border reforms and boost funds for Ukraine and Israel is on the brink.
“And lets not forget there is the [US-Mexico] border,” she said. “The site of so many Republican photo ops.”
“That’s the moment we are in, by voting it down, Republicans will be telling our allies our word cannot be trusted, telling dictators like Putin that our threats are not serious,” she said.
“And telling the American people they do not want to solve the crisis at the border, they want to campaign on it – you do not let a fire burn so that Donald Trump can campaign on the ashes,” Murray said.
Hours after the House descended into farce yesterday evening when Republicans failed to impeach the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, and blocked legislation to send military aid to Israel, the Senate is taking a crack at approving a complex bill to tighten immigration policy while assisting both Israel and Ukraine. If that legislation does not pass, and there’s plenty of reason to believe it will not, since Republicans say they no longer like the border security changes, the Senate’s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said they’ll vote on a bill that solely contains funds for Kyiv, and for the counterattack against Hamas. Will that attract the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate, and, if it does, will it make through the House, where Ukraine foes are plenty? We’ll find out soon enough.
Here’s what else is going on today:
Joe Biden says he will support the Israel-Ukraine aid bill, even if it does not include immigration policy changes.
The Mayorkas impeachment will die in the Senate, predicted Oklahoma’s Republican senator James Lankford, who negotiated the ill-fated immigration policy bill.
Nikki Haley had a terrible night in Nevada, where she came in second in the primaries to “none of these candidates”. This morning, she blamed the Republican party’s problems on Donald Trump, who appears on course to win its presidential nomination.
The big question looming over the Senate is: will either version of the Israel-Ukraine aid bill, one of which contains immigration policy changes, the other which does not, receive enough votes to pass?
To succeed, either legislation will need to receive 60 votes, meaning at least some Republicans will have to sign on.
Punchbowl News reports that John Thune, the number-two Republican in the Senate, was mum about how his lawmakers were feeling:
Thune noncommittal on whether there will be 60 votes to advance the foreign aid package without border. “Stay tuned,” he says
Independent senator Bernie Sanders says he will oppose the legislation to provide military aid to Israel, citing the widespread destruction and civilian casualties caused by its invasion of Gaza.
“Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas’s terrorism, but it does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people. Since this war began over 27,000 Palestinians have been killed and 67,000 wounded – two-thirds of whom are women and children. Over 1.7 million people have been driven from their homes and have no idea as to where they will be in the future. Almost 70% of the housing units in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged,” the Vermont lawmaker said.
“This bill provides $10bn dollars more in US military aid for the Netanyahu government to continue its horrific war against the Palestinian people. That is unconscionable. That is why I will be voting NO.”
Joe Biden will sign legislation to send new military aid to Ukraine and Israel, even if it does not contain policy changes intended to stop migrants from crossing the southern border, the White House announced.
Here’s what spokesman Andrew Bates had to say:
We support this bill which would protect America’s national security interests by stopping Putin’s onslaught in Ukraine before he turns to other countries, helping Israel defend itself against Hamas terrorists and delivering live-saving humanitarian aid to innocent Palestinian civilians. Even if some congressional Republicans’ commitment to border security hinges on politics, President Biden’s does not. We must still have reforms and more resources to secure the border. These priorities all have strong bipartisan support across the country.
Whether the Senate manages to pass any legislation today is a different matter.
The Senate will this afternoon take two votes on approving aid to Israel and Ukraine, one on a bill that will include hardline immigration policies, and one without, the chamber’s Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced.
“I have scheduled a vote on the supplemental that includes strong bipartisan border reforms that Republicans have demanded for months,” Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor. He went on:
Now, if Republicans blocked this national security package with border legislation that they demanded later today, I will give them the opportunity to move forward with the package without border reforms. This package will otherwise be largely the same. It will have strong funding for Ukraine, funding for Israel, help for innocent civilians in Gaza and funding to the Indo Pacific. The legislation on the floor today is one of the most important security packages the Senate has considered in a very long time. So the onus is on Senate Republicans to finally take yes for an answer.
Last year, Republicans blocked Senate passage of a bill to provide aid to Israel and Ukraine, demanding that the Democrats agree to pass a law to stem the flow of migrants across the US border with Mexico. But after Joe Biden and his allies announced their support this week for hardline policies intended to do that, the GOP said they were no longer interested – reportedly because Donald Trump pressured them to do so.
It’s unclear how Senate Republicans will vote today. In his speech, Schumer warned the party that they would be doing Trump’s bidding and harming national security if they block both pieces of legislation.
“It would be an embarrassment for our country, an absolute nightmare for the Republican party if they reject national security funding twice in one day. Today is the day for Republicans to do the right thing when it comes to our national security,” Schumer said.
“Why are the Republicans doing all this? Why have they backed off on border when they know it’s the right thing to do? Two words, Donald Trump.”

Blinken says ‘a lot of work’ remains on Gaza ceasefire and hostage talks,2024-02-07,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/07/hamas-responds-to-israel-plan-with-three-stage-proposal-to-end-gaza-war,"Remarks by US secretary of state come after Hamas responds to Israel plan with three-stage proposal to end conflict
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said “a lot of work” remains to be done to bridge the gap between Israel and Hamas on terms for a new ceasefire and hostage-release deal, after the militant group put forward its own far-reaching proposal for a permanent end to the fighting.
Reports in Egyptian media on Wednesday said negotiations were ongoing in Cairo, after Hamas’s demands for a lengthy ceasefire and conditions for a prisoner exchange.
Hamas laid out a detailed three-phase plan to unfold over four and a half months, responding to a proposal drawn up by the US, Israel, Qatar and Egypt. The plan stipulates that all hostages would be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, including senior militants, and an end to the war.
It is a position that Israel is almost certain to reject but which mediators are viewing positively, as it appears the group is willing to engage in further negotiations.
Hamas put forward its three-stage plan late on Tuesday via Qatari and Egyptian mediators. Under the proposal, Palestinian militants would exchange Israeli hostages they captured on 7 October for 1,500 Palestinian prisoners, secure the reconstruction of Gaza, ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and exchange bodies and remains, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.
The plan envisions three stages of a truce, of 45 days each. It comes in response to a proposal put forward by Israel two weeks ago for a six-week cessation of hostilities and the phased release of the estimated 130 Israelis still held hostage in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
In the Hamas plan, all female Israeli hostages, males under 19 and elderly and sick people would be released during the first 45-day phase, in exchange for Palestinian women and children from Israeli jails.
The remaining male hostages would be released during the second phase, and bodies exchanged in the third. By the end of the third phase, Hamas would expect the sides to have reached agreement on an end to the war.
The truce would also increase the flow of food and other aid to Gaza’s 2.3 million desperate civilians, who are experiencing severe shortages of food, water and medicine.
Israel has not yet publicly commented on the details of the Hamas proposal but several unnamed officials told local media that the demand to bring the war to a close was a “non-starter”. A senior Israeli official told the country’s Channel 12 News: “The meaning of Hamas’s answer is a refusal to deal.”
Blinken, who is on his fifth visit to the region since the war broke out, is trying to advance the ceasefire talks while pushing for a larger postwar settlement in which Saudi Arabia would normalise relations with Israel in return for a “clear, credible, time-bound path to the establishment of a Palestinian state”.
But the increasingly unpopular Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is opposed to Palestinian statehood, and his hawkish governing coalition could collapse if he is seen to be making too many concessions.
“There’s a lot of work to be done but we are very much focused on doing that work,” Blinken told Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog.
The US president, Joe Biden, also commented on Hamas’s counter-proposal. “There’s been a response from Hamas but it seems to be a little over the top … There are continuing negotiations right now,” he said.
Netanyahu has said repeatedly that the war will not end until there is total victory over Hamas. However, the unofficial Israeli position is likely to be more pragmatic.
The columnist Yoav Limor argued in the daily newspaper Israel Hayom: “Hamas’s response is an opening position – a very high opening position, admittedly, but not one that entirely precludes the possibility of reaching a deal.
“Obviously, Israel will not agree to the sweeping conditions that Hamas has posed … That said, Israel is prepared to discuss the details, such as the duration of the ceasefire, the quantity of aid allowed into Gaza and, of course, the number and identity of the prisoners who are to be released in exchange for the hostages. Presumably, that is what will happen now.”
A significant sticking point in talks so far is how many and which Palestinians will be released. In the week-long November truce, 110 Israelis were freed in return for 240 Palestinians, who were mostly women and children held for minor offences or in administrative detention. The new list is believed to include hardened militants serving life sentences.
Both sides are keen to blame the other for a failure to reach a second ceasefire deal. Hamas has set conditions that Israel is highly unlikely to accept, while Netanyahu faces the potential collapse of his far-right coalition government if Israel agrees to any sort of truce.
Blinken arrived in Israel overnight as part of his whistle-stop diplomatic tour of the region aimed at containing escalating violence across the Middle East triggered by the war in Gaza.
Israel began its military offensive in the strip after Hamas killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages in the devastating attack on Israel on 7 October.
At least 27,585 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli campaign, with thousands more feared buried under rubble, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.
About 85% of the 2.3 million-strong population have been displaced from their homes and more than half of the besieged Palestinian territory’s infrastructure has been destroyed, the UN says.

Gaza: Israel moves closer to Rafah offensive despite ‘bloodbath’ warning ,2024-02-09,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/biden-criticises-israel-gaza-military-campaign-over-the-top,"Biden and UN say assault on city where 1.3m civilians are sheltering would be disastrous
Israel has moved closer to a full-scale ground offensive against the southern Gaza city of Rafah, as Benjamin Netayahu ordered military leaders to present a plan to evacuate civilians from the area.
Despite warnings from a senior aid official that an assault on Rafah – where about 1.3 million displaced Palestinians are sheltering – would lead to a “bloodbath”, and the UN urging against forced mass displacement, Israel appeared determined to push ahead.
“It is impossible to achieve the war goal of eliminating Hamas and leaving four Hamas battalions in Rafah,” the Israeli prime minister said in a statement, rejecting a warning from the Biden administration that it could not support an offensive against Rafah. “On the other hand, it is clear that a massive operation in Rafah requires the evacuation of the civilian population from the combat zones.”
With more than half of Gaza already under evacuation orders, widespread destruction throughout the coastal strip, and continuing fighting, it was unclear where such a large number of people could safely be moved.
“No war can be allowed in a gigantic refugee camp,” said Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, warning of a “bloodbath” if Israeli operations expanded there. A United Nations spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said civilians in Rafah needed to be protected, but the UN did not want to see any forced mass displacement.
Situated on the southern border with Egypt, Rafah’s prewar population of several hundred thousand has increased massively as about half of the territory’s 2.3 million people have sought shelter in the city and surrounding areas.
The disclosure by Netanyahu’s office that it had requested detailed evacuation plans, along with a military plan for fighting in the city, came a day after Joe Biden described Israel’s military response in Gaza as “over the top” and said he was seeking a “sustained pause” in fighting.
“I’m of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in the Gaza Strip has been over the top,” the US president told reporters late on Thursday, even as his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, left the region without reaching an agreement.
Biden said he had been pushing for a deal to normalise relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, increase humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians and pause the fighting temporarily to allow the release of hostages taken by Hamas.
“I’m pushing very hard now to deal with this hostage ceasefire,” Biden said. “There are a lot of innocent people who are starving, a lot of innocent people who are in trouble and dying, and it’s got to stop.”
The previous day the US specifically warned against attacking Rafah. The US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said on Thursday that any assault on Rafah without due consideration of civilians would be a disaster and “we would not support it”.
The comments were echoed at the state department, with the spokesperson Vedant Patel saying that going ahead with such an offensive “with no planning and little thought in an area where there is sheltering of a million people would be a disaster”.
Biden’s comments mark a sharp change in language for the president, who has been supportive of Israel, including in the immediate aftermath of Hamas’s 7 October attack on southern Israel.
Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said Israeli military action on Rafah would be a “total disaster”.
Speaking before Netanyahu’s evacuation announcement, Lazzarini, said the situation there was “extraordinarily worrisome” and that airstrikes had hit near the agency’s base in Rafah on Thursday.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense, more and more confusing … any large-scale military operation among this population can only lead to an additional layer of endless tragedy that’s unfolding, and that we witness on a daily basis,” he said. “There’s a sense of growing anxiety and growing panic in Rafah. People have absolutely no idea where to go after Rafah … I don’t know how long we will be able to operate in such a high-risk environment.”
The office of the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, said Netanyahu’s plan for military escalation aimed to drive Palestinians from their land. In a statement it called on the UN security council to take heed, “because taking this step threatens security and peace in the region and the world. It crosses all red lines”.
The White House has become increasingly frustrated with statements from Israeli ministers, including Netanyahu. It denied reports earlier this week that Biden had privately called the Israeli prime minister “a bad fucking guy”.
Sources of friction include Israel’s resistance to winding up a war that has caused so many civilian casualties and Netanyahu’s rejection of US calls for progress towards a Palestinian state when the war is over.
Biden’s administration issued a national security memorandum on Thursday that calls on the state department to procure written assurances from countries receiving US weapons that they will abide by international law, including the provision of humanitarian assistance.
Biden, who has been under increasing domestic pressure over the crisis in the Middle East, was criticised for remarks during the early stages of Israel’s military campaign in which he described the death of innocent Palestinians as “the price of waging a war”.
Israel began its offensive after Hamas militants from Gaza killed 1,200 people and took 253 hostages on 7 October. Gaza’s health ministry says almost 28,000 Palestinians have been confirmed dead, with thousands more feared buried under rubble.
Despite bullish Israeli assessments of the progress it has made against Hamas, most recently by Netanyahu this week, US intelligence officials who briefed members of Congress suggested Israel was not close to eliminating the group.
Israeli forces bombed areas of Rafah on Thursday as diplomats sought to salvage ceasefire talks after Netanyahu rejected a Hamas proposal.
The strikes killed at least 13 people, including two women and five children, according to the Kuwaiti hospital, which received the bodies. At the scene of one of the strikes, residents used torches on their mobile phones as they dug through the rubble with pickaxes and their bare hands.
“I wish we could collect their whole bodies instead of just pieces,” said Mohammed Abu Habib, a neighbour who witnessed the strike.
Outside the hospital, relatives wept as they said farewell to their loved ones. Warda Abu Warda said she felt helpless. “Where do we go after Rafah? Do we go to the sea?” she asked.
Explaining his response to the crisis, Biden appeared to mix up the details of his diplomatic efforts, calling the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, the leader of Mexico.
“Initially, the president of Mexico, Sisi, did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in,” Biden said. “I talked to him. I convinced him to open the gate. I talked to Bibi [Netanyahu] to open the gate on the Israeli side.”

Middle East crisis: UN agency says Israel blocking food aid to Gaza as starvation fears grow – as it happened,2024-02-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/10/middle-east-crisis-israel-gaza-war-hamas-rafah-latest-news,"This live blog is now closed, you can read more of our Israel-Gaza war coverage here
A food shipment for 1.1 million Palestinians is stuck at an Israeli port due to recent restrictions from Israeli authorities, says the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) as an estimated 25% of families in Gaza face catastrophic hunger.
The Associated Press (AP) report that UNRWA’s director, Philippe Lazzarini, said on Friday that a convoy of food donated by Turkey had been sitting for weeks in the Israeli port city of Ashdod. The agency said that the Israeli contractor they work with received a call from Israeli customs authorities “ordering them not to process any UNRWA goods”.

The restrictions deepened a crisis between Israel and UNRWA, whose operations have been threatened following Israeli accusations that some of its workers participated in the 7 October Hamas attack that triggered Israel’s war in Gaza. Those accusations have led major donor nations, including the US, Canada, Australia and the UK, to suspend funding to the UN organisation.
In an update to its X account, UNRWA said “1,049 containers of rice, flour, chickpeas, sugar and cooking oil are stuck as families in Gaza face hunger and starvation”. That is enough to feed 1.1 million people for one month, say AP.
The World Food Program warned on Friday that Gaza could be plunged into famine as early as May.
It has just gone 6pm in Rafah, Tel Aviv and Beirut, and 7pm in Damascus. The Middle East crisis blog will be closing shortly but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Middle East coverage here.
Here is a recap of the latest developments:
A food shipment for 1.1 million Palestinians is stuck at an Israeli port due to recent restrictions from Israeli authorities, says the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) as an estimated 25% of families in Gaza face catastrophic hunger. UNRWA’s director Philippe Lazzarini, said on Friday that a convoy of food donated by Turkey had been sitting for weeks in the Israeli port city of Ashdod. The agency said that the Israeli contractor they work with received a call from Israeli customs authorities “ordering them not to process any UNRWA goods”.
The World Food Program warned on Friday that Gaza could be plunged into famine as early as May.
Israel’s plans for a military offensive on Rafah in the Gaza Strip are “alarming”, the EU’s foreign policy chief has said. Josep Borell said that “reports of an Israeli military offensive on Rafah are alarming”.
Children are going without food for days and some people are resorting to grinding animal feed into flour to survive, reports the BBC who spoke to people living in north Gaza. People also described digging down into the soil to access water pipes, for drinking and washing. International charity ActionAid has said that food is becoming so scarce in Gaza that people are resorting to eating grass. “Every single person in Gaza is now hungry,” the charity said, while the UN’s Office for Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said on Friday that almost one in 10 of Gazan children under five are now acutely malnourished.
Airstrikes on the Gaza Strip’s southernmost town of Rafah have killed at least 28 people. Each strike killed multiple members of three families, including 10 children, the youngest just three months old, said Associated Press (AP).
An Egyptian official told the Guardian that under no circumstances would fleeing Palestinians be allowed to cross the border into the Sinai peninsula, and any attempt to relocate them to Egyptian soil would collapse the peace deal between Egypt and Israel. The population of Rafah has swelled to more than 1.5 million people – roughly three-quarters of Gaza’s population – as people flee fighting elsewhere in Gaza.
Israel appears to be in breach of the orders issued a fortnight ago by the international court of justice requiring it to take immediate steps to protect Palestinians’ rights and cease all activities that could constitute genocide, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied territories, Francesca Albanese, has said.
Hamas on Saturday warned that there could be “tens of thousands” of dead and injured if the Israeli military attacked Rafah, in the far south of the Gaza Strip. In a statement Hamas said that any military action would have catastrophic repercussion. AFP said witnesses reported new strikes on Rafah early Saturday, raising fears among Palestinians of a looming ground invasion.
“People in hospitals should always feel safe” said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic as he journalists in Geneva on Friday that more than 350 attacks have taken place against healthcare in Gaza since hostilities erupted. A total of 645 people have died since 7 October and another 818 were injured as a result of these incidents said Jasarevic, with his comments coming amid allegations that a nurse was shot and critically injured while inside an operating theatre at a hospital in Khan Younis.
A senior Hamas official survived an assassination attempt in Lebanon by an alleged Israeli strike, a Palestinian security source told AFP. Another source told Reuters that the person targeted was close to Saleh al-Arouri, the Hamas deputy chief killed last month in a suspected Israeli strike on a suburb of Beirut. Sources said a Hezbollah member and two civilians were killed by the strike in the coastal town of Jadra, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the Lebanese border.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry on Saturday said that at least 117 people were killed in overnight bombardment, including more than 20 in strikes in Rafah. It also said 152 were injured in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said that three children were killed in a strike in Rafah. The PCRS also said that Israeli forces raided al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s biggest city, on Friday after a weeks-long siege during which the PRCS reported “intense artillery shelling and heavy gunfire”.
The PRCS accused Israeli forces of the ‘deliberate targeting’ of a PRCS ambulance that resulted in the death of two of its medics, Yusuf Al-Zeino and Ahmed Al-Madhoun.
The Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said neither Iran nor Lebanon had sought to expand hostilities in the region. “Iran and Lebanon confirm that war is not the solution, and that we absolutely never sought to expand it,” he told a press conference alongside his Lebanese counterpart in Beirut on Saturday. Amir-Abdollahian has held meetings in Lebanon with Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati, regional groups, including Hezbollah and various Palestinian groups.
“Israel’s declared ground offensive on Rafah would be catastrophic and must not proceed,” Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. “There is no place that is safe in Gaza and no way for people to leave.”
Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister said “the people of Gaza cannot disappear into thin air”, as she warned that an Israeli offensive on Rafah would be “a humanitarian catastrophe”.
Israel’s army has deployed artificial intelligence-enabled military technology in combat for the first time in Gaza, raising fears about the use of autonomous weapons in modern warfare.
Hezbollah said on Saturday it had seized an Israeli Skylark drone over Lebanese airspace “in good condition”. The Skylark is a small, unmanned aerial vehicle typically used for surveillance and produced by Israel-based weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems.
Yemen’s Houthi militia held a funeral on Saturday for at least 17 militants killed during joint US-UK airstrikes targeting the Iran-backed militants.
At least 364 attacks on healthcare have happened in the occupied West Bank since 7 October, resulting in 10 fatalities and 62 injuries, said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic on Friday. He noted that 44 health facilities had been affected, including 15 mobile clinics and 24 ambulances.
The Saudi foreign ministry cautioned against the “extremely dangerous repercussions” of Israel “storming and targeting” the city of Rafah. It said “this continued violation of international law and international humanitarian law” confirmed the necessity of convening the UN security council urgently “to prevent Israel from causing an imminent humanitarian catastrophe”.
Israeli occupation forces continued their siege of the Nasser medical complex in Khan Younis for the 20th day and reached its northern gate, reports Al Jazeera. “The occupation forces have been besieging us for 20 days and we are suffering from a shortage of food and drink,” Nahidh Abu Tamiyya, the head of the surgical department told an Al Jazeera correspondent.
Two Palestinians have been killed by an Israeli sniper – one in front of the Nasser medical complex reception gate, and the other in the emergency department, according to Wafa news agency. It said that medical teams cannot move between the complex’s buildings due to the snipers, and that the lives of 300 health personnel, 450 patients and wounded, and 10,000 displaced people inside the Nasser medical complex are threatened.
A six-year-old Palestinian girl who went missing after the family’s car came under fire in Gaza has been found dead, the Hamas-run health ministry and her relatives said, accusing Israel of killing her. The last time Hind Rajab had been seen was about two weeks ago when she was surrounded by dead relatives after becoming trapped in the vehicle as they tried to flee Gaza City as Israeli forces advanced. The PPRCS had frequently posted updates on its X account pleading for updates and information on Rajab.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) Philippe Lazzarinisaid he followed “reverse due process” in sacking nine staff members accused by Israel of being involved in Hamas’s 7 October attacks. Lazzarini said he did not probe Israel’s claims against the employees before dismissing them and launching an investigation.
Three people were killed in on Israeli airstrikes that targeted a building in an upmarket area near Damascus on early Saturday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the SOHR said three people were killed in the airstrikes but could not immediately confirm whether the dead were fighters. He added that many other people were injured in the strikes on a neighbourhood hosting “villas for top military and officials.”
Iran’s football federation said on Saturday it had asked world football’s governing body, Fifa, to suspend Israel’s football federation over the country’s war in Gaza.
Yemen’s Houthi militia held a funeral on Saturday for at least 17 militants killed during joint US-UK airstrikes targeting the Iran-backed militants, reports Reuters citing the Houthi-run Saba news agency.
The Houthis have launched waves of exploding drones and missiles at commercial ships since 19 November in what they say is a response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza, prompting the UK and the US to start retaliatory strikes last month.
“These crimes will not discourage the Yemeni people from continuing their support and backing of their brothers in the Gaza Strip,” Saba said in its coverage of the funerals.
Besides the airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, the US and the UK have returned the militia to a list of terrorist groups as turmoil from the Israel-Hamas war spreads through the region.
The Houthi campaign has disrupted international shipping, causing some companies to suspend transits through the Red Sea and instead take the much longer, costlier journey around Africa.
The Iranian foreign minister said on Saturday neither Iran nor Lebanon had sought to expand hostilities in the region, four months after the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel set off a series of flare-ups across the Middle East.
“Iran and Lebanon confirm that war is not the solution, and that we absolutely never sought to expand it,” Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told a press conference alongside his Lebanese counterpart in Beirut, reports Reuters.
News agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) have shared further details on the Israeli strike in Lebanon.
A Palestinian security source told AFP that a senior Hamas official had survived an Israeli assassination attempt in Lebanon, with rescuers reporting two civilians killed in the strike south of Beirut. A security source told Reuters that a member of the powerful, Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah had also been killed.
Another source told Reuters that the senior Hamas official targeted was close to Saleh al-Arouri, the Hamas deputy chief killed last month in a suspected Israeli strike on a suburb of Beirut.
Israeli forces and Lebanese movement Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, have traded near-daily fire since war broke out on 7 October between Israel and the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip. But the Israel-Lebanon violence has been largely contained to the border area, and Saturday’s strike was the second-farthest deadly attack from the frontier in four months of hostilities.
Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Israeli forces struck a car in the coastal town of Jadra, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the border.
The Palestinian source, requesting anonymity for security concerns, said the strike “was a failed attempt to assassinate a senior official in the [Hamas] movement”.
An official with the Lebanese Risala Scout association, which operates rescue teams and is affiliated with the Hezbollah-allied Amal movement, told AFP that two civilians had been killed. The official identified them as a vegetable vendor and a Syrian man on a motorbike who both happened to be nearby.
An AFP photographer at the scene saw a damaged car and a charred motorcycle nearby, with bloodstains all over the site of the strike near the beach in Jadra.
There was no immediate comment from Israel.
Also my colleague, the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent Bethan McKernan has written a news story on the dozens killed in Rafah airstrikes as a full-scale Israeli ground offensive looms. You can read the full piece here:
Airstrikes on the Gaza Strip’s southernmost town of Rafah have killed at least 28 people as more than a million civilians sheltering in the area brace for the possibility of a full-scale Israeli ground offensive on the territory’s last place of relative safety.
As Israeli forces have expanded ground operations steadily southwards in their war against Hamas over the past four months, Rafah – situated on the border with Egypt, and home before the war to about 280,000 people – has become the last refuge for more than half of the strip’s population of 2.3 million.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Friday that he had instructed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and defence ministry to draw up plans for troops to enter Rafah and evacuate civilians, leading to widespread panic in the overcrowded makeshift tent camps that now cover the area.
With two-thirds of Gaza already under evacuation orders, widespread destruction throughout the coastal strip and continuing fighting, it is unclear to where such a large number of people could safely be moved. An Egyptian official told the Guardian that under no circumstances would fleeing Palestinians be allowed to cross the border into the Sinai peninsula, and any attempt to relocate them to Egyptian soil would collapse the peace deal between Egypt and Israel.
My colleague, Emine Sinmaz in Jerusalem has shared the following report on the case of six-year-old Hind Rajab who was found dead on Saturday, 12 days after her cry for help:
“I’m so scared, please come,” were some of the last words six-year-old Hind Rajab said in a telephone call to rescuers after her family’s car came under fire in Gaza City.Trapped in the vehicle and surrounded by her dead relatives, for three hours she pleaded with the Red Crescent to save her.But the aid agency lost contact with the ambulance dispatched to her aid on 29 January and its crew and Hind remained missing.
Now Hind’s family has said that she was found dead inside the car in the Tel al-Hawa area of Gaza City on Saturday morning.
“Hind and everyone else in the car is martyred,” her grandfather, Baha Hamada, told Agence France-Presse. “[Family members] were able to reach the area because Israeli forces withdrew early at dawn today.”The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) added that it had located its bombed-out ambulance just metres away, and that its two paramedics, Yusuf Al-Zeino and Ahmed Al-Madhoun, had also been killed.
A food shipment for 1.1 million Palestinians is stuck at an Israeli port due to recent restrictions from Israeli authorities, says the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) as an estimated 25% of families in Gaza face catastrophic hunger.
The Associated Press (AP) report that UNRWA’s director, Philippe Lazzarini, said on Friday that a convoy of food donated by Turkey had been sitting for weeks in the Israeli port city of Ashdod. The agency said that the Israeli contractor they work with received a call from Israeli customs authorities “ordering them not to process any UNRWA goods”.

The restrictions deepened a crisis between Israel and UNRWA, whose operations have been threatened following Israeli accusations that some of its workers participated in the 7 October Hamas attack that triggered Israel’s war in Gaza. Those accusations have led major donor nations, including the US, Canada, Australia and the UK, to suspend funding to the UN organisation.

The World Food Program warned on Friday that Gaza could be plunged into famine as early as May.
Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister said the “need in Rafah is already unbelievable”, warning that an Israeli offensive on Rafah would be “a humanitarian catastrophe”.
In an update on her X account, Baerbock said: “The people of Gaza cannot disappear into thin air.”
Die Not in #Rafah ist schon jetzt unfassbar. 1,3 Mio. Menschen suchen dort auf engsten Raum Schutz vor den Kämpfen. Eine Offensive der israelischen Armee auf Rafah wäre eine humanitäre Katastrophe mit Ansage. Die Menschen in #Gaza können sich nicht in Luft auflösen. 1/2
She added: “Israel must defend itself against Hamas terror, but at the same time alleviate the suffering of the civilian population as much as possible. That’s why another ceasefire is needed so that the hostages can finally be released.”
Baerbock said she would discuss “the way” to a ceasefire “next week in Israel”.
Lebanon’s Iran-backed armed faction Hezbollah said on Saturday it had seized an Israeli Skylark drone over Lebanese air space “in good condition”.
The Skylark is a small, unmanned aerial vehicle typically used for surveillance and produced by Israel-based weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems, Reuters reported.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) have accused Israeli forces of the ‘deliberate targeting’ of a PRCS ambulance that resulted in the death of two of its medics.
In a post to its X account, the PRCS shared a video showing the remains of a PRCS ambulance, that the humanitarian organisation says was destroyed deliberately by Israeli occupation forces.
The PRCS said two of its colleagues, Yusuf Al-Zeino and Ahmed Al-Madhoun, were just meters away from six-year-old Hind Rajab. The last time Hind Rajab had been seen was about two weeks ago when she was surrounded by dead relatives after becoming trapped in the vehicle as they tried to flee Gaza City as Israeli forces advanced.
The PRCS had frequently posted updates on its X account pleading for updates and information on Rajab. The BBC had also highlighted her story.
“Hind tragically lost her life alone after pleading with our teams for hours in a terrified and desperate voice, ‘Come take me.’ Rest in peace, Hind, and to the heroes of humanitarian work, Yusuf and Ahmed,” said the PRCS.
In this video, horrifying scenes show the deliberate targeting by the Israeli occupation of the PRCS ambulance, resulting in the killing of our colleagues Yusuf Al-Zeino and Ahmed Al-Madhoun, who were just meters away from the child Hind.

The latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 117 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes and 152 were injured in the past 24 hours.
According to the statement, at least 28,064 Palestinians have been killed and 67,611 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October.
The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.

Dozens killed in Rafah airstrikes as full-scale Israeli ground offensive looms,2024-02-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/10/dozens-killed-in-rafah-airstrikes-as-full-scale-israeli-ground-offensive-looms,"More than a million civilians sheltering in Gaza’s last place of relative safety brace for all-out assault
Airstrikes on the Gaza Strip’s southernmost town of Rafah have killed at least 44 people as more than a million civilians sheltering in the area brace for the possibility of a full-scale Israeli ground offensive on the territory’s last place of relative safety.
As Israeli forces have expanded ground operations steadily southwards in their war against Hamas over the past four months, Rafah – situated on the border with Egypt, and home before the war to about 280,000 people – has become the last refuge for more than half of the strip’s population of 2.3 million.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Friday that he had instructed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and defence ministry to draw up plans for troops to enter Rafah and evacuate civilians, leading to widespread panic in the overcrowded makeshift tent camps that now cover the area.
With two-thirds of Gaza already under evacuation orders, widespread destruction throughout the coastal strip and continuing fighting, it is unclear to where such a large number of people could safely be moved.
The Egyptian foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, said on Saturday that an Israeli ground offensive on Rafah would have “disastrous consequences,” and that Israel’s aim was eventually to force the Palestinians from their land. 
An Egyptian official told the Guardian that under no circumstances would fleeing Palestinians be allowed to cross the border into the Sinai peninsula, and that any attempt to relocate them to Egyptian soil would collapse the peace deal between Egypt and Israel.
A doctor at a UN-run clinic in Rafah said: “I encountered an elderly woman who was looking for a wheelchair for her disabled husband. She said: ‘If I can’t get this chair for my husband, it will be our end. With the occupation in Gaza, how can I take him to Sinai? I cannot leave him alone in Gaza.’”
Israel has carried out airstrikes in Rafah almost daily, even after telling civilians in recent weeks to seek shelter there from fierce ground combat in Khan Younis, just to the north.
Three airstrikes on homes in the Rafah area killed 44 people overnight into Saturday, according to a health official and Associated Press journalists who saw the bodies arriving at hospitals. The strikes killed members of three families, including 12 children, the youngest three months old.
In Khan Younis, Israeli forces opened fire at Nasser hospital, the area’s largest, killing at least two people and wounding five, according to the medical charity Doctors Without Borders. Ahmed Maghrabi, a physician at the hospital, said in a Facebook post that Israeli tanks had reached the hospital gates on Saturday morning, trapping those inside and making the facility inaccessible to those in need of medical attention. 
Israel’s threats of a full-scale attack on Rafah – designed to put pressure on the Hamas leadership, which is believed to be hiding in tunnels in the area – have not yet been realised, and Netanyahu did not provide details or a timeline in his announcement.
He has, however, implied the operation is inevitable, and appears ready to push ahead despite mounting warnings from aid agencies and the international community that a Rafah offensive would be a “bloodbath”.
“It is impossible to achieve the goal of the war of eliminating Hamas by leaving four Hamas battalions in Rafah,” Netanyahu’s office said on Friday.
Outside Israel, criticism of his statement was swift. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said on Friday that a major Israeli offensive in Rafah “can only lead to an additional layer of endless tragedy”.
Hamas said in a statement on Saturday that any Israeli military action in Rafah would have catastrophic repercussions that “may lead to tens of thousands of martyrs and injured”.
The Palestinian militant group, which assumed control of Gaza in 2007, said it would hold “the American administration, international community and the Israeli occupation” responsible if that happened.
Israel’s plans for Rafah drew unusually fierce criticism from the US, the Jewish state’s most important ally, after days of increasing friction between Netanyahu and the Biden administration.
Joe Biden described Israel’s military response in Gaza as “over the top” and said he was seeking a “sustained pause” in fighting in remarks to reporters earlier this week.
“I’m of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in the Gaza Strip has been over the top,” the US president said after his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, left the region without any progress on a ceasefire deal.
Biden said he had been pushing for a deal to normalise relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, increase humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians and pause the fighting temporarily to allow the release of hostages taken by Hamas.
US officials have also made clear to their Israeli counterparts that Washington expects significant progress towards a two-state solution to the decades-old conflict at the end of the fighting. Netanyahu, however, is opposed to Palestinian statehood, and his hawkish governing coalition could collapse if he is seen to be making too many concessions.
“I’m pushing very hard now to deal with this hostage ceasefire,” Biden said. “There are a lot of innocent people who are starving, a lot of innocent people who are in trouble and dying, and it’s got to stop.”
Netanyahu this week flatly rejected the terms of a Hamas counter-proposal for a ceasefire and exchange of hostages and prisoners after the success of a week-long truce in late November. He has also rebuffed US pressure, saying there could be no solution to Israel’s security issues except “absolute victory”.
He said at televised press conference that “surrendering to Hamas’s delusional conditions”, which include a call for a 135-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of the remaining 130 or so hostages, “would lead to another massacre, and to a great tragedy on Israel that no one would be willing to accept”.
In a blow to the hopes of the families of the remaining hostages being held by Hamas, Netanyahu also said they would be released only by continued military pressure on the militant group. 
Israel’s war in Gaza, now in its fifth month, was sparked by Hamas’s unprecedented offensive of 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and another 250 abducted as bargaining chips.
The Israeli offensive has killed 28,000 people in Gaza, displaced more than 85% of the population and reduced over half of the strip’s infrastructure to rubble.
According to the UN, about 10% of children under five in Gaza are showing signs of acute malnutrition. Food deliveries that reach the strip are regularly mobbed by desperate and hungry people, residents say.
Violence triggered by the war in Gaza is escalating across the Middle East, as hostilities between Iran and Israel, as well as the US, move increasingly into the open through the actions of Iran-backed militias in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.
During a visit to Lebanon on Saturday, the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said a political solution was the only way to end the Gaza conflict, and that Tehran was in talks with Saudi officials on the issue.
He also warned Israel against taking any steps towards a full-scale war against the powerful Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, saying it would be Netanyahu’s “last day.” Hezbollah and Israel have traded near-daily fire across the disputed Israeli-Lebanese border since 7 October.
A senior Hamas official survived what Palestinian security forces called an Israeli assassination attempt in Beirut on Saturday in which two civilians were killed. Israel did not immediately comment on the allegation, and rarely acknowledges drone and airstrikes conducted beyond Palestinian territory.

"Middle East crisis live: ‘Enough’ hostages alive to warrant war, says Netanyahu – as it happened",2024-02-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/11/middle-east-crisis-live-international-warnings-mount-ahead-of-planned-rafah-offensive,"Israeli prime minister says country ‘will do our best to get all those who are alive back,’ ahead of expected ground invasion of Rafah
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has suggested that “enough” of the 130 or so remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza are alive to justify Israel’s ongoing war in the region.
Asked how many of the hostages are still alive, Netanyahu said “enough to warrant the kind of efforts that we’re doing”.
“We’re going to try to do our best to get all those who are alive back and, frankly, also the bodies of the dead,” he said in the interview with ABC’s This Week programme.
His comments come after Hamas’ armed-wing, the Al Qassam Brigades said Israeli strikes on the Gaza strip over the past 96 hours had killed two Israeli hostages and seriously injured eight others (see earlier post at 12.08).

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, suggested that “enough” of the 130 or so remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza are alive to justify Israel’s ongoing war in the region. Asked how many of the hostages are still alive, Netanyahu said “enough to warrant the kind of efforts that we’re doing”. “We’re going to try to do our best to get all those who are alive back and, frankly, also the bodies of the dead,” he said in an interview with ABC’s This Week programme. Seperately, Netanyahu told Fox News Sunday he had not spoken to Joe Biden since the US president made remarks earlier this week about Israel’s military response in Gaza being “over the top”. The comments come as Israel faces growing international warnings over its planned offensive in Rafah. The UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, said he was “deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah - over half of Gaza’s population are sheltering in the area”. Two White House officials said Biden and Netanyahu would speak together on Sunday.
The US military said it struck more devices and missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen that were prepared to launch against ships in the Red Sea.
Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip over the past 96 hours have killed two Israeli hostages and seriously injured eight others, Hamas’ armed-wing Al Qassam Brigades said over the group’s Telegram channel.
Any Israeli ground offensive in Rafah on the Gaza border will “blow up” the hostage exchange negotiations, Hamas-run Aqsa television channel quoted a senior Hamas leader as saying.
Israeli forces have discovered a tunnel network hundreds of metres long and running partly under the UN’s Relief and Works Agency for Palestine’s (UNRWA) Gaza headquarters, the military said, calling it new evidence of Hamas exploitation of the main relief agency for Palestinians.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israeli forces have prevented oxygen from reaching the al-Amal hospital for over a week, resulting in the deaths of three patients. The PRCS said Israel has also not provided medical equipment, and continues to block the delivery of fuel for the hospital’s electricity generators, despite the fuel supply running out in two days, risking a shutdown.
A total of 28,176 Palestinians have been killed and 67,784 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. An estimated 112 Palestinians were killed and 173 injured in the past 24 hours, the ministry added.
Joe Biden will speak with Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, two White House officials said, according to Reuters.
Biden, who is spending the weekend at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, is expected to speak with the Israeli prime minister on Sunday morning, one of the officials said.
Netanyahu told Fox News Sunday earlier that he has not spoken with Biden since the “over the top” comment on Thursday and did not know what the US president meant by it. He said that he appreciates the US’s support for its war in Gaza.
“I’m of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in the Gaza Strip has been over the top,” Biden told reporters at the White House earlier this week.
The US military said on Sunday it struck more devices and missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen that were prepared to launch against ships in the Red Sea.
The strikes took place on Saturday between 4-5pm (1300-1400 GMT) north of the city of Hodeida, the US Central Command (Centcom) wrote on X.
American “forces successfully conducted self-defence strikes against two unmanned surface vessels (USV) and three mobile anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM)... that were prepared to launch against ships in the Red Sea,” the statement said.

The Houthi-run Al-Masirah television on Saturday night reported three strikes on the Salif port area, while an AFP correspondent in the area heard loud blasts.
The strikes are part of a series of actions taken by the US and its allies against the Houthis, aimed at halting the rebel group’s repeated attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes.
The Houthis have repeatedly launched attacks on ships in the Red Sea since November over Israel’s war in Gaza.
But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, endangering shipping on a key route for global trade.

Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, will travel to Israel in the middle of next week, a spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said on Sunday, declining to give further details, according to Reuters.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told Fox News Sunday he has not spoken to Joe Biden since the US president made remarks about Israel’s military response in Gaza being “over the top”.
“I’m of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in the Gaza Strip has been over the top,” Biden told reporters at the White House on Thursday.
He added that he has been pushing for a deal to normalise Saudi Arabia-Israel relations, increased humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians and a temporary pause in fighting to allow the release of hostages taken by Hamas.
Here are some images of people marching in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, in support of Palestinians in Gaza:
The Abu Mustafa family’s tent is hard against the high concrete and metal fence separating Gaza from Egypt in Rafah, reports Reuters.
The family is among more than a million Palestinians now crammed into the area around Rafah and fearing they have nowhere left to flee inside a tiny strip largely reduced to rubble and where fighting still rages.
“Every day, we’re on the run. Being displaced is tough because I have two daughters with disabilities. I can’t carry them around. I don’t have a car or a cart,” Laila Abu Mustafa said. “If there will be more displacement, I’m not moving,” she said, amid mounting worries of an imminent ground invasion by Israeli troops.
Fear of an assault on Rafah is the constant subject of every conversation in the crammed city, said Mariam, who fled her Gaza City home early in the war with her three young children.
“I can’t describe how we feel. There is turmoil in my head. My children keep asking me when Israel will invade Rafah and where we will go and if we will die. And I don’t have the answers,” she said.
Reuters have also captured some images of the Abu Mustafa family in Rafah.
Egypt is threatening to suspend its peace treaty with Israel if Israeli troops are sent into Rafah, and says fighting there could force the closure of the territory’s main aid supply route, according to the Associated Press.The threat to suspend the Camp David Accords, a cornerstone of regional stability for nearly a half-century, came after Benjamin Netanyahu said sending troops into Rafah was necessary to win the four-month-old war in Gaza.Over half of Gaza’s population of 2.3m have fled to Rafah to escape fighting in other areas, and are packed into sprawling tent camps and UN-run shelters near the border. Egypt fears a mass influx of refugees who may never be allowed to return.The standoff between Israel and Egypt, two close US allies, comes as aid groups warn that an offensive in Rafah would worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.
AP reported that two Egyptian officials and a western diplomat confirmed Egypt’s threats, but spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief reporters on the sensitive negotiations.
Oman said it opposes Israel’s planned offensive in Rafah.
“We warn of the serious repercussions of the continuation of the occupation in its indiscriminate aggression in the Gaza Strip and its plans to storm Rafah,” the Omani foreign ministry said in a statement quoted by Al Jazeera.
“We appeal to the international community to take concrete measures to dissuade Israel from its arrogance and push it to cease fire and open the crossings,” it said.
Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip over the past 96 hours have killed two Israeli hostages and seriously injured eight others, Hamas’ armed-wing Al Qassam Brigades said over the group’s Telegram channel.

The threat of an Israeli incursion into Gaza’s southernmost town of Rafah persisted on Sunday, with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reportedly promising “safe passage” to civilians displaced there. Despite criticism, Netanyahu reiterated his intention to extend Israel’s military operation to the city. In an interview airing Sunday on ABC News, Netanyahu said: “We’re going to do it”. The comments come as Israel faces growing international warnings over its planned offensive in Rafah. The UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, said he was “deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah - over half of Gaza’s population are sheltering in the area”.
Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip during the past 96 hours have killed two Israeli hostages and seriously injured eight others, Hamas’ armed-wing Al Qassam Brigades wrote on Telegram.
“Their conditions are becoming more dangerous in light of the inability to provide them with appropriate treatment. (Israel) bears full responsibility for the lives of those injured in light of their continued bombing,” the statement said. These claims are yet to be independently verified.
There are reportedly about 130 or so Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip by Hamas.
The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club, an advocacy group that keeps a tally of detainees from the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, said that Israeli forces have arrested 6,950 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since 7 October, according to Al Jazeera.
In December, a UN office said it was “seriously concerned” about a dramatic rise in Israel’s arrest of Palestinians and called for an investigation into allegations of torture in Israeli custody.
Since the 7 October Hamas attack and Israel’s subsequent heavy bombardment of Gaza, Palestinians held in Israeli jails have reported deteriorating conditions, including overcrowding, restricted access to food and water and limited visits from family or lawyers.
Many have said they were subjected to beatings and abuse by detention guards. Israel’s Prison Service has previously said that all prisoners in its custody “are detained according to the provisions of the law”.

"Cousin of Hind Rajab, 6, haunted by her last call after family car shot at in Gaza",2024-02-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/11/cousin-of-hind-rajab-6-haunted-by-her-last-call-after-family-car-shot-at-in-gaza,"Mohammed Hamada says he is devastated by death of Palestinian girl and relatives, whose bodies have now been recovered
The cousin of a six-year-old Palestinian girl who died in Gaza after her family’s car appeared to come under fire from Israeli tanks has told how he spoke to her as she waited to be rescued and said he was haunted by her last words.
Hind Rajab’s body was recovered on Saturday, alongside those of six of her relatives, and two Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) paramedics, Yusuf Al-Zeino and Ahmed Al-Madhoun, sent to find her in Gaza City.
Her cousin, Mohammed Hamada, said he was devastated by her death, as he accused the Israelis of having killed her.
Trapped in the car, Hind had phoned the Red Crescent and pleaded with them to come to save her, telling them: “I’m so scared, please come.” The aid agency lost contact with the ambulance dispatched to her aid on 29 January and its crew and Hind remained missing until her death was confirmed on Saturday. Her exact cause of death is unclear.
Hind had also spoken on the phone to her cousin, Mohammed Hamada, as she waited to be rescued.Speaking from Frankfurt, Germany, the 28-year-old said: “Hind said: ‘Please help me. Please come and rescue us. Rescue me.’ She told me that she was injured in the leg.“I was literally crying because I was unable to do anything, and I think all of my family were in the same situation. But the funny part was how strong she was. My wife told her: ‘Sweetheart, don’t be scared, God loves you and he will take care of you.’ And she just responded with ‘OK’. I think Hind was braver than all of us.”Hamada said he has been overwhelmed by grief since that day and that he relived the trauma on Saturday after finding out that Hind’s body had been recovered.“We all thought that when we get a chance to get their bodies and bury them that it’s going to be easier but it wasn’t like this. It was like deja vu so we were again with all the pain and the tears,” he said.
The tragedy comes as Israel prepares a ground offensive in Rafah in southern Gaza, despite warnings from aid agencies that such an assault would be a “catastrophe”.
More than half the strip’s population of 2.3 million are thought to be sheltering in the city, having fled the Israeli military campaign elsewhere in Gaza. Israel had previously designated Rafah a safe zone. Hamada said the tragedy unfolded on 29 January, when Hind and her uncle, aunt and four cousins attempted to flee Gaza City which had been under bombardment by the Israeli military. But the family appeared to have encountered Israeli tanks in the Tel al-Hawa area with their car coming under fire.Hamada said he first found out from other relatives at around 13.40 (11.40GMT) that the family had been “shot” by the Israeli military and that he and another cousin contacted the PRCS for help.He then called the family directly and spoke to Hind’s 15-year-old cousin, Layan Hamadeh, who was also in touch with the PRCS. The aid agency has published a partial recording of her harrowing phone call in which she can be heard screaming.Hamada said: “Layan told me that her father and my aunt – her mother is my aunt – were shot and they are all dead. She said the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers were shooting them and she also told me that the tanks are getting closer to them.“She said that she was injured, Hind too, and they need help. And then I asked her about her father and my aunt, if they were OK. She told me that she could not look them in the face. I really don’t know why, if it was because their injuries were so bad or because they were away from the car.”Layan explained that she had been injured in the leg, as had Hind, but that “she didn’t know how bad the injury or injuries were because she was covered – all of them were covered – in blood,” Hamada added.He said he spoke to her a few times in between trying to coordinate the rescue with the Red Cross but that the last time he was able to reach her was at 14.40.The IT worker, who moved from Gaza to Germany 10 years ago, said: “The last call I had with Layan, she was scared and she screamed that they are shooting at her and I believe she died while we were on the call with her.“I took the timestamps of all the calls that were made and I believe either me or the Red Cross were the last talking to her. I could hear that they were shooting at her and this was the last time. A couple of minutes later I was able to call them again but this time Hind came on the phone and said Layan has passed away.”Soon after the family lost contact with Hind, who Hamada described as a “funny kid” with dreams of becoming a doctor. He said Layan wanted to be a lawyer and was “very smart, very thoughtful”.
Hamada said the family does not yet know how Hind died but that they hold the IDF responsible.
“They were evacuating safely from one place to another because they could hear shots ... and then they got attacked. The Red Cross coordinated [the rescue] with the IDF – clearly, they did – and then [paramedics] got shot too. So who else is responsible for that?”
The PRCS has accused Israel of deliberately targeting the ambulance, which they said had been bombed. It published footage of what it said were the blackened and destroyed remains of the vehicle. The ambulance was found just metres away from Hind’s family’s car, which was said to be smashed and riddled with bullet holes.
The Guardian has contacted the IDF for comment.

Middle East crisis: international concern grows over looming Rafah offensive as death toll from airstrike reportedly rises – as it happened,2024-02-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/12/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-israel-gaza-hostages-freed-rafah-strikes-latest-news,"This live blog is now closed. For the latest on Israel-Gaza, read our most recent report:
Both the White House and the US state department have been consistent today in repeating the US position as being in favor of an “extended humanitarian pause” in fighting in Gaza – but without calling for an official ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas.
The White House moments ago, in the media briefing in the west wing, welcomed news that the Israeli military had freed two hostages during a raid by special forces in Rafah overnight.
John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, said there can be no end to the Gaza crisis until Hamas releases all hostages, Reuters adds.
The White House said it cannot confirm that civilians were killed in the overnight raid on Rafah by Israel to retrieve hostages.
Meanwhile the US state department said it is not Washington’s assessment that the Israeli air strikes in Rafah overnight during the hostage rescue represents the launch of a full scale offensive in the area. The departments concur with Israel that it believes Hamas military battalions are operating in Rafah. The state department briefing has just finished. The White House briefing is ongoing.
That concludes today’s blog on the ongoing crisis in Israel and Gaza. Here’s the latest from today:
At least 74 civilians in Palestine were reportedly killed due to Israel’s airstrike in Rafah, Reuters reported, citing Palestine TV. The death toll from the Rafah airstrikes increased from 67 reported earlier today.
US officials said that Israel’s airstrike launched in Rafah doesn’t represent a full-scale offensive. The White House and the US state department both repeated that the US is in favor of an “extended humanitarian pause” in fighting in Gaza, but did not call for an official ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas.
The White House said on Monday that Israel should protect the over 1 million civilians living in Rafah amid airstrikes. The White House is reiterating that Israel must have a credible plan to protect the people in Rafah before its planned invasion of the southern Gaza city.
The US said it would not be threatening to hold back funding or military assistance from Israel in light of Israel’s bombing of Rafah, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday.
Hamas says three of eight Israeli hostages injured in Rafah airstrikes have died. A Hamas spokesperson said that they would postpone releasing the names of the deceased until “the fate of the remaining wounded becomes clear”.
Thank you for reading the Guardian’s coverage.
France evacuated 42 people from Gaza on Monday through the Rafah border crossing, AFP reported.
French officials evacuated 42 people from Gaza, including French nationals and staff from the French cultural institute.
“After a request from France, 42 people today left the Gaza Strip through the Rafa border crossing” which is located in Egypt, France’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
A spokesperson for the United Nation secretary general said that the UN “will not be party” to forced displacement of civilians living in Rafah, adding that there is no place in Gaza that is safe, AFP reported.
UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric spoke to reporters on Monday about Israel’s expected military invasion of Rafah and the UN’s plan to protect civilians.
Dujarric told reporters that the UN would “ensure that anything that happens is done in full respect of international law, in the full respect of the protection of civilians,” adding that the UN “will not be party to forced displacement of people…as it is, there is no place that is currently safe in Gaza.”
“You can’t send people back to areas that are littered with unexploded ordnance, not to mention a lack of shelter,” the UN spokesman said, referring to parts of the northern and central Gaza Strip.
Dujarric’s comments come after Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Israel’s military to prepare for a military invasion of Rafah and promised to provide a “safe passage” for millions of civilians residing in the densely-packed city during an interview with ABC over the weekend.
Netanyahu did not specify where exactly civilians would be evacuated to.
The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates called on the international community to “stop Israel’s genocide and destruction of Palestinian people”, in a statement issued Monday following Israel’s latest airstrike in Rafah.
“World leaders have a historic responsibility to prevent Israel from launching a ground assault on Rafah and the foreseeable apocalyptic consequences.
Expressing concern without taking determined effective actions is a moral and political failure,” the territory’s ministry of foreign affairs and expatriates said in a statement.
The latest statement comes after 74 civilians in Palestine were killed in Rafah by Israeli airstrike, with Israel expected to launch a military invasion in the city. Local officials have said that the death toll from the airstrike is expected to rise.
“Gaza is a slaughterhouse and Israel’s deliberate mass killing, starvation, and the forcible transfer of 1.3 million people, half of whom are children, in Rafah is the most barbaric and savage of all,” the statement read.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) representative for the United Nations said the country is “extremely worried” about Israel’s military operations in Rafah, adding that any military operation by Israel would have “unacceptable consequences”.
“The UAE is extremely worried at this point,” said ambassador Lana Nusseibeh during an event in Dubai.
“Any military operation in Rafah would have unacceptable consequences,” she added.
Nusseibeh reiterated the need for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine and a ceasefire agreement, BBC reported.
“You cannot deny the Palestinian right to statehood - and that is an Arab consensus,” she said.
Nusseibeh also defended the UAE’s diplomatic ties with Israel amid mounting anger in the region, saying that continued cooperation between the two countries has secured resources in Gaza, AFP reported.
“Because of that cooperation... we have a field hospital in Gaza and we have a maritime hospital docking in the Al-Arish port,” Nusseibeh said.
At least 74 civilians in Palestine were reportedly killed due to Israel’s airstrike in Rafah, Reuters reported, citing Palestine TV.
The latest death toll is an increase from earlier, when local officials reported that 67 Palestinians were killed in heavy airstrikes launched by the Israeli military.
Officials have said that fatality figures are likely to rise.
The White House and the US state department have reiterated that the US is strongly in favour of a negotiated, extended humanitarian pause in the war between Israel and Hamas, while there remains no US call for an official ceasefire.
The White House on Monday pressed Israel to work toward a pause in the Gaza conflict, Reuters added, in order to win freedom for more hostages held by Hamas and rapidly increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians.
We’re wrapping up some of the news lines emerging from the White House and US State Department briefings just now.
John Kirby, White House national security spokesperson, talked of some progress in negotiations toward a humanitarian pause – but said more work remains.
We continue to support an extended humanitarian pause,” Kirby said.
US president Joe Biden spoke to Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone yesterday and said the Israeli military operation in Rafah in the far south of Gaza “should not proceed” without a plan to protect civilians there.
Early on Monday afternoon at the state department press briefing, spokesman Matthew Miller said the US government continues to push for a pause and believes “a deal is possible”.
CIA director William Burns will be in Cairo tomorrow and international talks are expected in the Egyptian capital into Wednesday to discuss a deal for a pause in the fighting and the return of more hostages.
“We believe these discussions are important,” Miller said.
Qatar and Turkey will take part. It is not yet confirmed whether Israel will participate.
My Guardian US colleague Gloria Oladipo will take over this live blog now.
The White House has acknowledged that the US does not know the locations of the remaining hostages snatched by Hamas during its murderous attacks on southern Israel last October 7 and taken into Gaza, and they may not all still be alive.
During the weekday media briefing in the west wing moments ago with national security spokesman John Kirby, which is now ongoing with White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Kirby said: “We do not have a lot of specific information about where each of the hostages are.”
There are believed to be at least 130 hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas, which controls the Palestinian territory, out of the approximately 240 people who were originally taken on October 7. Since then, some groups have been released and some hostages have died.
Of those remaining in Hamas captivity in Gaza, Kirby said: “We need to accept the possibility that some hostages are no longer alive.”

The departments concur with Israel that it believes Hamas military battalions are operating in Rafah. The state department briefing has just finished. The White House briefing is ongoing.
The White House is reiterating that Israel must have a credible plan to protect the people in Rafah before launching an all-out offensive to try to eliminate Hamas from the southern Gazan city.
The US is not opposing Israeli aspirations to “go into Rafah to remove Hamas”, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said in the White House media briefing moments ago.
But “it’s not advisable to go in in a major way without a credible plan for the million people taking refuge in Rafah. Israel has an obligation to protect them,” Kirby said.
The US state department is currently conducting a press briefing and spokesman Matthew Miller is responding to questions about whether the US is motivated to withdraw US funding and arms for Israel in order to pressure the state to de-escalate its military offensive in Gaza.
Under questioning from reporters, Miller has said that the US is using tools of persuasion to pressure Israel but indicated those tools do not include the threat of holding back on funding and military assistance, while saying America’s leverage on Israel is currently “not enough”.
Miller is focusing on public comments coming from US leadership, led by US president Joe Biden, who has cranked up his criticism in recent days of Israel’s violent destruction in Gaza.
“When the US stands up and says something public, that matters,” Miller said.
He added: “We have seen the government of Israel respond to it, not always the way we want or to the degree that we want.”
Miller said the US does not have “a magic wand” to fix international problems and influence policy. But reporters are pushing back by saying, yes, but the US does have the “wand” in the shape of unstinting financial support for Israel’s military might, which is fundamentally different from what another reporter characterised as “finger wagging” so far by the US to Israel.
Unhelpfully, the White House is now conducting it’s press briefing, so we’ll bring you highlights from that asap. Sticking with State Department for now.
Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in a televised address after chairing a meeting of his cabinet on Monday that Israel’s Gaza offensive will be at the top of the agenda in his talks with Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi that are planned for Wednesday, Reuters reports.
There aren’t many more details available yet, but we’ll bring them to you as they emerge.
In the same address, Erdoğan said the two leaders would also talk about the economy, trade, tourism, energy and defence.
The armed wing of Hamas said on Monday that three of eight Israeli hostages who were seriously injured following Israeli airstrikes had died from their wounds, Reuters reports.
We will postpone the announcement of the names and pictures of the dead for the coming days until the fate of the remaining wounded becomes clear,” the Al Qassam Brigades said in a statement.
More details to when they emerge. This statement follows the Israeli assault in Rafah overnight in which special forces and other military rescued two hostages held by Hamas, while dozens died in collateral destruction wrought by Israeli air strikes. The hostages were being held in the city of Rafah in the far south of Gaza, on the border with Egypt, where Palestinian residents and refugees are packed in.
Prior to posting the powerful warning on investigating war crimes in Gaza, International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan reposted a powerful X post from Malaysian international lawyer and war crimes lawyer Shyamala Alagendra.
She has posted to share an opinion piece from this past weekend’s Observer – the Guardian’s Sunday paper sibling – entitled “The world is waging war on its children, in an obscene mockery of international law” and written by foreign affairs commentator Simon Tisdall. The piece is subtitled: “From Gaza to Ukraine, from Sudan to Myanmar, youngsters are being raped, abducted, maimed, killed and even recruited as soldiers.”
From Ukraine and Gaza to Sudan and Myanmar, respect for the “laws of war” is being eroded or is non-existent. Most shocking, and unforgivable, is the wanton harm done to children.… The cost to children will be borne [by] generations to come.” https://t.co/N9MQyF5rwy

From Ukraine and Gaza to Sudan and Myanmar, respect for the “laws of war” is being eroded or is non-existent. Non-combatants are deliberately targeted. Most shocking, and unforgivable, is the wanton harm – the UN term is “grave violations” – done to children.
In his latest report on children and conflict, UN secretary general António Guterres warned that children “continued to be disproportionately affected” by war-related violence and abuses. By this, he meant killing and maiming, rape, sexual violence, abductions, school attacks and recruitment of child soldiers. All were on the rise.”

"Israel in breach of international law if it denies Gaza food and water, says UK foreign secretary",2024-02-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/13/israel-in-breach-of-international-law-if-gaza-denied-food-and-water-says-cameron,"David Cameron issues stark warning and implies UK will not back a Rafah offensive
Israel is in breach of international law as the occupying power if it fails to provide food and water to the people of Gaza, the UK foreign secretary, Lord Cameron, told peers on Tuesday in his clearest warning yet over Israel’s conduct.
He also said it was simply not possible for people in Rafah to leave as proposed by the Israeli Defense Forces, remarks that suggest the UK would not endorse any Israeli plan to mount a full-scale attack on the area containing more than 1 million people in crowded refugee camps. He also argued the US was beginning to shift on when Palestine might be recognised so Israel was no longer given a veto.
He said: “The people who are in Rafah on many occasions have already moved three, four or five times. And it’s not possible to move again, they can’t go north because they’d be going back to homes that have been destroyed. They can’t go south, because that would involve going into Egypt, which none of us want to see and the Egyptians do not want to see.
“That is why it’s so important, the Israelis stop and think before going ahead with any operations and wrap up.”
His comments came as the US said it was reviewing reports that Israel had harmed civilians in Gaza, under a set of guidelines aimed at ensuring countries receiving US arms conduct military operations in line with international humanitarian law.
State department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the process was taking place under the Civilian Harm Incident Response Guidance (CHIRG), which is used to investigate specific incidents where civilians may have been harmed by US weapons.
The Biden administration has faced criticism for continuing to supply arms to Israel as allegations pile up that American-made weapons have been used in strikes that have killed or injured civilians.
On Tuesday, Cameron sidestepped a request by one peer for the UK to halt arms supplies to Israel, adding Hamas could stop the fight immediately.
In his speech, Cameron said the US was reviewing the point at which it was willing to recognise a Palestinian state, since recognition that came only after an agreement between Palestine and Israel would provide Israel with a veto.
He said just because recognition of Palestine did not happen at the beginning, “it doesn’t mean it has to wait right till the end. One of the things that is beginning to change, which I think is hopeful, is the American posture. Up to now that has been that recognition can only come when Israel and Palestine agree on the creation of a Palestinian state, but if you do that you do, effectively, give Israel a veto over a Palestinian state. That’s the opposite of creating the sort of unstoppable momentum towards a two-state solution that we all want to see”.
In Cameron’s clearest warning to Israel about its conduct he said as the occupying power in Gaza, Israel had to make sure that humanitarian aid and food, water and shelter were available to people in Gaza, “because if they don’t do that, that would be a breach of international humanitarian law”.
Setting out his overall strategy, Cameron said: “You’ve got to get, in our view, the Hamas leaders out of Gaza, otherwise any ceasefire won’t last because the problem will still be there. You’ve got to dismantle the operation of terrorist attacks. You’ve got to have a new Palestinian Authority and governments in place. You have got to give the Palestinian people a political horizon to a better future and two-state solution and, crucially, you’ve got to release all of the hostages and do that very quickly.”
He said if there was a pause in fighting as long as six weeks – something he suggested Israel was willing to agree – that could bring about a permanent ceasefire without a return to fighting.
His remarks implied that Hamas would not be entirely destroyed as an organisation, but its leadership removed from Gaza.
He said he hoped there would be a meeting on Friday in Munich involving the US secretary of state and foreign ministers from the major European foreign ministries, along with Arab ministers.
Cameron added he would be asking his Chinese counterpart “given the importance of trade to China, they should be as fully supportive of free trade in the Red Sea as we are”.

Middle East crisis: World Health Organization accuses Israel of impeding aid delivery in Gaza – as it happened,2024-02-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/14/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-gaza-cairo-ceasefire-talks-latest-news,"WHO says that fewer than half of its requested aid-delivery missions in Gaza have been approved by Israel
The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that fewer than half of its requested aid-delivery missions in Gaza have been approved by Israel, stressing the need to reach and resupply devastated hospitals across the territory, reports AFP.
“Hospitals are completely overwhelmed and overflowing and undersupplied,” said Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative for the occupied Palestinian territories.
Speaking to reporters in Geneva via video link from Rafah in southern Gaza, he described how patients were frequently undergoing unnecessary amputations of limbs that could have been saved under ordinary circumstances.
Since November, only 40% of the missions WHO had requested to deliver aid to northern Gaza had been facilitated, he said. “Since January, that figure is much lower.”
Only 45% of requested missions in southern Gaza had meanwhile been made possible, he said. “These missions have been denied, impeded or postponed,” he said, describing the situation as “absurd”.
“Even when there is no ceasefire, humanitarian corridors should exist so WHO, UN and their partners can do their job” he said, calling it a “shrinking humanitarian space”.
Peeperkorn also warned that “military activities in ... these densely populated areas would be of course an unfathomable catastrophe”. It “would even further expand the humanitarian disaster beyond imagination,” he said.
A leading British rabbi has publicly opposed an Israeli military offensive in Rafah, saying it is “impossible to remain silent”.
Jonathan Wittenberg, the senior rabbi of Britain’s Masorti community, said in a statement:
These words are written out of deep concern about Israel’s actions and potential actions in Rafah, making it impossible to remain silent.
The calculated barbarity and strategic cruelty of Hamas’s military, and the presence of its forces in tunnels beneath Rafah, are beyond doubt …
But over a million Palestinian civilians, many already in flight from the north of Gaza, are now trapped with nowhere to go. In countless references, Judaism has, throughout its history, stressed our duty to refugees and the helpless. How can we be unmoved by their grief and unbearable suffering? ….
I write out of horror at what may ensue and its potential consequences in unimaginable suffering. I write out of dread at the future hatred this is likely to engender, and out of fear that these actions may haunt us, and the good name of Israel and the Jewish People, for generations.”
It has just gone 5pm in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut, and 6pm in Damascus.
Here is a recap of the latest developments:
The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that Gaza’s hospitals are ‘completely overwhelmed’ and accused Israel of impeding its aid-delivery missions in Gaza. Speaking to reporters in Geneva via video link from Rafah in southern Gaza, Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative for the occupied Palestinian territories said that fewer than half of its requested aid-delivery missions in Gaza have been approved by Israel.
“Military operations in Rafah could lead to a slaughter in Gaza” and a “humanitarian operation at death’s door”, warned the UN. Martin Griffiths, the UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said the scenario “we have long dreaded is unraveling at alarming speed” and “our humanitarian response is in tatters”.
Israeli intelligence chief David Barnea met CIA director William Burns in Cairo on Tuesday for talks on a Qatari-brokered plan to halt fighting in Gaza. The negotiations, which also involved Qatar’s prime minister and Egyptian officials, are part of an intensifying effort to secure a ceasefire before Israel proceeds with a ground incursion into the southern city of Rafah, where more than half of the territory’s population has fled.
A Hamas source told news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) that a delegation was heading to Cairo to meet Egyptian and Qatari mediators, after Israeli negotiators held talks with the mediators on Tuesday.
Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, an outspoken critic of Israel’s conduct of the Gaza war, was also due in Cairo on Wednesday for talks with president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, says AFP.
Ireland and Spain’s prime ministers have written and implored EU chiefs to take action over the “deteriorating” situation in Gaza a day after the taoiseach claimed Israel had become “blinded by rage”. In a highly unusual move, Leo Varadkar and Pedro Sánchez wrote to the European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. They asked the commission to “urgently review whether Israel is complying with its obligations to respect human rights in Gaza”.
Israel is in breach of international law as the occupying power if it fails to provide food and water to the people of Gaza, the UK foreign secretary, Lord Cameron, told peers on Tuesday in his clearest warning yet over Israel’s conduct. He also said it was simply not possible for people in Rafah to leave as proposed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), remarks that suggest the UK would not endorse any Israeli plan to mount a full-scale attack on the area.
WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said that he is “alarmed by what is reportedly happening at Nasser Medical Complex in Gaza.” “Nasser is the backbone of the health system in southern Gaza. It must be protected. Humanitarian access must be allowed,” he said.
Displaced Palestinians have begun evacuating Nasser hospital complex in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis after weeks of being isolated by fighting. Videos seen by the Associated Press showed dozens of Palestinians carrying sacks of their belongings and making their way out of the Nasser hospital complex, while a doctor wearing green hospital scrubs walked ahead of the crowd, some of whom were carrying white flags.
Nasser hospital and the surrounding are has ‘turned into a battle zone’, reports Al Jazeera journalist Hani Mahmoud in Rafah, southern Gaza. In an update on Wednesday morning, Mahmoud said the situation in Nasser hospital was becoming “more and more risky” for medical staff and hundreds of displaced people sheltering there. He reported a lack of fuel, medical supplies and oxygen at the hospital, plus “a sewage flood as the facility is without electricity”.
“There is sometimes even no space to walk” in Rafah, Médecins Sans Frontières project coordinator in Gaza, Lisa Macheiner said describing the unfolding situation and attacks in the area. Macheiner also spoke of the “lack of access to food … water … sanitation … healthcare” and said “there is a huge need for primary healthcare for follow up of patients, who had surgeries, multiple surgeries” and of people suffering with infected wounds. The medical humanitarian organisation has called on the government of Israel to halt any offensive on Rafah.
Israeli air attacks have been reported across Gaza, including in the southern part of the strip, by Al Jazeera correspondents. They said artillery shelling had hit the centre of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza and Israeli warplanes had carried out repeated raids on the southern neighbourhoods of Gaza City.
About 100 representatives of hostages flew to The Hague on Wednesday to file a “crimes against humanity” complaint at the international criminal court (ICC) against Hamas, reports AFP. The ICC is the world’s only independent court set up to probe the gravest offences including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
103 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes and 145 were injured in the past 24 hours, said the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.
An Israeli woman was killed and eight others were injured in a suspected Hezbollah attack, according to Israeli military and medical officials reports The Times of Israel. Safed’s municipality also said rockets hit the base, as well as the city’s industrial zone and an area near Ziv hospital. There has been no immediate claim for the attack.
Israeli military jets began carrying out a widespread wave of strikes in Lebanese territory on Wednesday, the IDF spokesperson, Daniel Hagari said.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres said he was ‘deeply troubled’ by the number of journalists killed in the Gaza conflict. Reporting on an Israeli drone attack in Muraj, north of Rafah that allegedly targeted two journalists, Al Jazeera said the attack had resulted in its Arabic correspondent Ismail Abu Omar having to have his leg amputated, and had also seriously injured photojournalist Ahmed Matar. Guterres condemned the attack.
At least 18 Palestinians were arrested overnight in the occupied West Bank, including two women from Jericho, reports Al Jazeera. It cites the Palestinian Prisoners Society and the Palestinian commission of detainees and ex-detainees affairs which said detentions also took place in Hebron, Qalqilya, Nablus, East Jerusalem and Ramallah. It put the total number of arrests after 7 October at 7,020 and called it “one of the most prominent tools of collective punishment”.
Militants from the Islamic State (IS) group attacked military barracks in central Syria this week, killing nine soldiers, an opposition war monitor said. The Syrian army and officials have not confirmed the attack, reports AP. IS claimed responsibility for the attack on Monday near the town of Al-Sukhna, saying its fighters also seized weapons abandoned by fleeing soldiers and set fire to the barracks. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three Syrian troops were wounded in addition to the nine killed in Al-Sukhna.
US Central Command (Centcom) said its forces launched a strike on Tuesday on a missile in a Houthi-controlled part of Yemen. It said the cruise missile was about to be fired at ships in the Red Sea.
Protesters denouncing Israel’s offensive in Gaza disrupted a foreign policy debate in Sweden’s parliament on Wednesday, as the country’s foreign minister reiterated support for Israel’s right to self-defence against Hamas. Security guards escorted a woman out of the public gallery after she shouted that Israel “was committing genocide”, as foreign minister Tobias Billstrom presented the government’s foreign policy declaration to parliament.
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) have shared an audio update from its project coordinator in Gaza, Lisa Macheiner describing the unfolding situation in Rafah.
She said:
We do see people start to move, to take the little belongings they have left to try to get to a safer place. They don’t know any more what to do and they just feel unsafe and terrified about what is going to happen next. ‘Where is it safe?’, ‘where should we go?’ – and there is no answer to that and it really leads to a feeling of despair.”
“It’s quite sad to see how empty people’s eyes are despite all the resilience that people have here,” said Macheiner. She described the attacks she had witnessed in Rafah:
There have been attacks here in Rafah yesterday [11 February] and also during the night. From Khan Younis, we could hear a lot of heavy explosions. Our windows and doors were shaking throughout the whole night. It was very, very noisy. People don’t feel safe. Children are terrified. They are distressed and it’s been going on for months now and people are exhausted.”
She said there are “hundreds of thousands of people everywhere” and that there is “no space any more”. “There is no space to move in a car. There is sometimes even no space to walk,” she added.

Ireland and Spain’s prime ministers have written and implored EU chiefs to take action over the “deteriorating” situation in Gaza a day after the taoiseach claimed Israel had become “blinded by rage”.
In a highly unusual move, Leo Varadkar and Pedro Sánchez have written to the European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.
“We are deeply concerned at the deteriorating situation in Israel and in Gaza, especially the impact the ongoing conflict is having on innocent Palestinians, especially children and women.”
“The expanded Israeli military operation in the Rafah area poses a grave and imminent threat that the international community must urgently confront.”
In a three page letter they list a litany of urgent measures they want to see including an immediate ceasefire and access to humanitarian aid.
It then asked the commission to do an immediate assessment “of whether Israel is complying with its obligations, including under the EU/Israel Association Agreement, which makes respect for human rights and democratic principles an essential element of the relationship; and if it considers that it is in breach, that it proposes appropriate measures to the Council to consider.”
This it says is “against the background of the risk of an even greater humanitarian catastrophe posed by the imminent threat of Israeli military operations in Rafah, and given what has occurred, and continues to occur in Gaza since October 2023, including widespread concern about possible breaches of IHL and international human rights law by Israel”.

Protesters denouncing Israel’s offensive in Gaza disrupted a foreign policy debate in Sweden’s parliament on Wednesday, as the country’s foreign minister reiterated support for Israel’s right to self-defence against Hamas, reports AFP.
According to AFP, security guards escorted a woman out of the public gallery after she shouted that Israel “was committing genocide”, as foreign minister Tobias Billstrom presented the government’s foreign policy declaration to parliament.
“Sweden supports Israel’s legitimate right to defend itself against Hamas in accordance with international law,” Billstrom said before being interrupted. He added that “in light of the catastrophic situation in Gaza, the government believes that a ceasefire is necessary for humanitarian reasons.”
Protesters started to chant as members of parliament began debating the country’s support for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
During his policy declaration, Billstrom also said that Sweden’s number one priority would be “support for Ukraine” in its fight against Russia.
“Sweden will continue to support Ukraine as long as needed – politically, humanitarian, militarily and economically,” Billstrom said.
Police told AFP that six people were detained by security guards, and one of those had then been arrested suspected of “violent resistance.”
A small group of protesters also gathered outside the parliament.
In late January, Sweden paused payments to UNRWA after Israeli allegations that some staff members at the agency had taken part in the 7 October attack by Hamas.
Martin Griffiths, the UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said the scenario “we have long dreaded is unraveling at alarming speed”.
The scenario we have long dreaded is unraveling at alarming speed. Today, I’m sounding the alarm once again: Military operations in Rafah could lead to a slaughter in Gaza.

In a post to X, Griffiths wrote that military operations in Rafah could lead to a “slaughter in Gaza”. He said:
“Today, I’m sounding the alarm once again: Military operations in Rafah could lead to a slaughter in Gaza. They could also leave an already fragile humanitarian operation at death’s door.”
In a statement, Griffiths said “no amount of dedication and goodwill is enough to keep millions of people alive, fed and protected – while the bombs are falling and the aid is choked off”. He finished by saying “our humanitarian response is in tatters”.
Ireland and Spain have requested the EU commission to “urgently review whether Israel is complying with its obligations to respect human rights”.
The EU's commitment to human rights and dignity can have no exceptions.Given the critical situation in Rafah, Ireland and Spain have just requested the @EU_Commission to urgently review whether Israel is complying with its obligations to respect human rights in Gaza.We also…
Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez announced the update on X. He added: “We also recall the horror of 7 October, and call for the release of all hostages and an immediate ceasefire that can facilitate access for urgently needed humanitarian supplies.”
It comes after taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday that Israel is not listening to “any country in the world”, including the US, and has become “blinded by rage”.
According to the Irish Times, Varadkar told the Dáil during Leaders’ Questions, that Israel was going to make the situation “much worse for their own security” in the long-term by “going down the path they’re going”. He also warned of a “serious risk of a massacre” occurring in Rafah if a ground assault were to occur.
Israel govt has become ‘blinded by rage’, says Taoiseach, as he promises Ireland will take more action. Government behaving like “rogue state” - Coveney. Others warn attack on Rafah would be like Srebenica. https://t.co/5LNc2s22b4
Palestinians have begun evacuating the main hospital in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, according to videos shared by medics on Wednesday reports AP. Weeks of heavy fighting had isolated the medical facility and claimed the lives of several people inside it.The war between Israel and Hamas, now in its fifth month, has devastated Gaza’s health sector, with less than half of its hospitals even partially functioning as scores of people are killed and wounded in daily bombardments. Israel accuses the militants of using hospitals and other civilian buildings as cover.Videos seen by AP showed dozens of Palestinians carrying sacks of their belongings and making their way out of the Nasser hospital complex, while a doctor wearing green hospital scrubs walked ahead of the crowd, some of whom were carrying white flags.
The Israeli military ordered the evacuation of the hospital and surrounding areas last month. But as in previous instances, medics said patients were unable to safely leave or be relocated, and thousands of people displaced by fighting elsewhere remained there. Palestinians say nowhere is safe in the besieged territory, as Israel continues to carry out strikes in all parts of it.The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said last week that Israeli snipers on surrounding buildings were preventing people from entering or leaving the hospital. It said 10 people had been killed inside the complex over the past week, including three shot and killed on Tuesday.About 300 medical staff were treating 450 patients, including people wounded in strikes, said the ministry. It said 10,000 displaced people were sheltering in the facility and that Israel had ordered the evacuation of the displaced people but said the medics and patients could stay.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
An Israeli woman was killed and eight others were injured in a suspected Hezbollah attack, Israeli military and medical officials said.
The Times of Israel cites the Israel Defense Forces as saying that some of the rockets had hit the northern command headquarters base in the city of Safed, which is about 13 kilometers (8 miles) from the Lebanese border.
There has been no immediate claim for the attack but the Times of Israel say it was “it was believed to have been carried out by the Hezbollah terror group”.
“Numerous launches were identified crossing from Lebanon into the areas of Netua, Menara, and into an IDF base in northern Israel,” Israeli military said, adding that it was striking the launch sites.
Safed’s municipality also said rockets hit the base, as well as the city’s industrial zone and an area near Ziv hospital.
According to the Times of Israel, medics found the body of the woman who was killed as they scanned buildings that were hit by the rocket fire. Ziv hospital said eight injured people were brought to the emergency room after the rocket attacks on the city, including one person in a serious condition and another in a moderate condition. Six others were being treated for light injuries.
At least 18 Palestinians were arrested overnight in the occupied West Bank, including two women from Jericho, reports Al Jazeera.
It cites the Palestinian Prisoners Society and the Palestinian commission of detainees and ex-detainees affairs which said detentions also took place in Hebron, Qalqilya, Nablus, East Jerusalem and Ramallah. It put the total number of arrests after 7 October at 7,020.
Arrests are “one of the most prominent tools of collective punishment”, the groups said in a statement on Telegram, reports Al Jazeera.

This blog is now closed
Cyclone warning issued for Queensland’s Gulf of Carpentaria
The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a tropical cyclone warning for the coastal areas of NT and far north Queensland around the Gulf of Carpentaria.
The tropical low is expected to be slow moving and develop on Thursday and Friday with a moderate risk of becoming a tropical cyclone, and on Friday the low is likely to move south west to the Gulf coast and then on Saturday be inland and weakening.
“Even if it doesn’t develop into a tropical cyclone, parts of the Gulf of Carpentaria coast are likely to experience strong to gale force winds and heavy rainfall” BoM said.
The low is expected to move west over central NT and then over northern WA bringing heavy rainfall over the weekend and next week. BoM said there is a chance that the low reaches waters west of the Kimberley by next Wednesday, where there is low risk to strengthen into a tropical cyclone.
We will wrap up the live blog. Here are the major points from today:
The prime ministers of Australia, Canada and NZ issued a joint statement saying they were ‘gravely concerned’ about Israeli plans for a ground offensive in Rafah.
The unemployment rate ticked up from 3.9% to 4.1% as the treasurer warned the country was entering into a period of economic uncertainty.
A new taskforce has been set up in New South Wales to support the Environment Protection Authority’s criminal investigation into the widespread use of mulch found to be contaminated with asbestos.
Anthony Albanese and Penny Wong announced another $50m in funding for Ukraine.
NSW Health has warned of high-dose MDMA tablets being found containing around twice the average dose of other MDMA tablets found in recent circulation.
The prime minister ruled out a suggestion to random breath-test MPs.
Anthony Albanese announced his engagement to partner Jodie Haydon.

‘Amorphous global scam’: Asic aware of HyperVerse complaints in 2020, Senate hears
Australian Securities and Investments Commission deputy chair Sarah Court has told Senate estimates that the corporate regulator was aware of complaints about the HyperVerse crypto scheme as early as 2020, saying it had information about the “scam unfolding” at that time.
HyperVerse, the subject of a Guardian Australia investigation, has been named in US court proceedings as a “pyramid and Ponzi scheme” that allegedly defrauded investors globally of US$1.89bn and which operated from 2020 to 2022. It was allegedly operated by Sam Lee and Ryan Xu, two of the directors of the collapsed Australian crypto company Blockchain Global which owes creditors $58m.
Court confirmed that the corporate regulator referred information relating to HyperVerse to Victoria Police in 2020, however the referral was not acted upon, with Police referring the case back to the regulator in 2022.
“We became aware of complaints about HyperVerse … through 2020 [as] we saw information about this scam unfolding,” Court told Senate estimates.
She said that the Hyper Tech group operated an “amorphous global scam”.
This group that we might broadly call the Hypertech group … we understand was an offshore, crypto, effectively a pyramid scheme, that was set up in 2020 and there’s been losses estimated in very significant amounts globally.
In effect, in our view, that HyperVerse group is a scam.
Court was also asked why Asic had advised liquidators that it did not intend to take action against Xu and Lee after they were referred in the liquidator’s report for alleged potential breaches of the corporations act.
Liberal senator Andrew Bragg asked: “Have you taken action against these directors?”
In response, Court said: “Not yet.” She added that Asic was now assessing a “detailed” report from the liquidator received in October.
‘Words without actions are meaningless’: Varied reactions to Australia’s joint statement on Rafah 
Let’s bring you some reactions after prime minister, Anthony Albanese, joined with his Canadian and New Zealand counterparts to warn Israel against a carrying out a “devastating” and “catastrophic” ground offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza.
The three leaders issued a joint statement saying “there is simply nowhere else for civilians to go”.
The leader of the Australian Greens, Adam Bandt, said it had taken the Labor government too long to start to realise the humanitarian consequences of conducting military operations in densely populated Gaza:
The looming invasion of Rafah is something that the whole international community must stop, but words without actions are meaningless … that’s why Labor should stop backing the invasion [of Gaza] full stop.
The co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Alex Ryvchin, highlighted other parts of the three prime ministers’ joint statement:
We share the concerns for civilians contained in the statement and echo the call for Hamas to surrender and release the hostages. However, the statement proposes no mechanism to achieve any of this.
It is known that the remaining Hamas battalions are in Rafah, along with the Hamas leaders who orchestrated this war and the 130 hostages held in violation of any norms of international law.
Hamas has rejected any ceasefire proposals that would see it relinquish power or disarm. It steadfastly refuses to surrender or release the hostages. In order to avoid a devastating battle for Rafah, the international community should with one voice call for Hamas to surrender and end this war.
Federal government pledges $50m for long covid
The federal government is committing $50m to improve primary care for people with long Covid after a parliamentary committee inquiry into the chronic condition.
The government today accepted seven of the nine recommendations from the house standing committee on health, aged care and sport’s inquiry into long Covid and repeated covid infections, and noted the other two recommendations.
The government’s initial response to the committee’s report, which was tabled in parliament in April, included a $50m investment from the medical research future fund for research into long Covid.
It has now committed a further $50m from the fund for better primary care for the condition, including in multidisciplinary team-based healthcare.
The health minister, Mark Butler, said long Covid was an emerging health issue, both in Australia and internationally.
The Albanese government is strengthening Medicare for all Australians, but particularly to provide the kind of multidisciplinary team-based healthcare for people with chronic and complex conditions like long Covid.

Most Victorian homes without power will be reconnected by Saturday: government
The Victorian government says 50,000 of the remaining 55,668 homes without power from the storms earlier this week will be reconnected by 6pm Saturday, with a further 3,000 currently being assessed and likely to be connected early next week.
There are three bushfire advice messages in place across the state, and one for severe weather in East Gippsland.
Meanwhile, there are still 700 active requests for assistance, with the busiest volunteer VICSES units at Monash, Emerald and Greater Dandenong.
Five government schools, one independent, seven Catholic and 24 early learning centres are still without power.
Death sentence of Australian citizen in China will ‘impact on the relationship’, says Penny Wong
The foreign minister, Penny Wong, has spoken about the case of the Australian citizen, Dr Yang Hengjun, who has been detained in China since 2019 and was last week issued with a suspended death sentence. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said last week that Australia had conveyed its “outrage” to the Chinese government.
Wong told Senate estimates today:
It is the case that decisions of this nature will have an impact on the relationship. This decision will inventively reverberate for Australians who feel deeply about this tragic development. I think Senator [Simon] Birmingham said that the sentence can only harm in which the way the Chinese system is viewed … and I think that is unfortunately true.
Wong also weighed in on the Albanese government’s policy to “stabilise” the relationship with China. She said when the government pursued stabilisation, it did not assume that meant there would be no differences or “problematic developments”.
It did mean we would work to have avenues to be able to navigate those issues. I’ve said previously, and we know, we expect [that] China will continue to be China. It will continue to press its interests, as will Australia.
Bridget Archer reveals reason behind Coalition rejection of Assange motion
Liberal MP Bridget Archer has told the ABC the reason most of her Coalition colleagues voted against a motion calling for Julian Assange to be brought back to Australia is due to the wording it, rather than the intent behind it.
She said the parliamentary friendship group behind the motion had hoped for unanimous support in the parliament.
If you cannot come to terms on particular language that might be used, so be it. I think the outcome is a strong one, and I think it sends a powerful message.
Assange’s brother still confident Dutton will support solution to bring Wikileaks founder home
The brother of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange told the ABC he is not reading opposition leader Peter Dutton and the coalition (minus Bridget Archer) voting against a motion in the House yesterday to bring Assange back home to Australia as a change in position.Gabriel Shipton said Dutton had said in the past that he would support the government in a solution to bring Assange back home, and he believed Dutton still stood by that statement.
He said the reason for Barnaby Joyce abstaining probably had more to do with it being hard for him to cross the floor when he had a lot of attention on him.
He said the UK high court of justice hearings next week were do or die for Assange, saying if he was extradited to the US, he could die in prison.
‘Broken Promise’: Opposition tries to rename stage 3 tax cuts bill
Earlier in the day when the stage 3 tax cuts changes legislation went through the House of Representatives, the opposition tried a number of times to rename the bill to add (Broken Promise) or (Not Actually Dealing With the Cost of Living) or (Entrenching Bracket Creep) to the title of the legislation. The ABC’s Greg Jennett put it to the manager of opposition business, Paul Fletcher, this afternoon that such amendment attempts are a farce.
Fletcher said he rejects that description, saying it is a “core part of the parliamentary process, but we are making a point” about the policy change.
Tony Burke concerned employers putting non-compete clauses in contracts
The employment and workplace relations minister said it might make sense for CEOs, but for GPs, hairdressers, yoga instructors and other workers it made less sense, particularly for employees on modest wages.
He said:
I am really happy to just put out there on all the evidence I have seen so far and I have only seen the beginnings of it, I am concerned about this. I don’t want people to be in a situation where your existing employer prevents you from getting the next job.
He said the assistant minister for competition, Andrew Leigh, first raised this issue with him and it was being examined as part of the competition taskforce.
Tony Burke tells ABC inflation not workers fault
The employment and workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, is on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing and has been asked whether it is now time to start “moderating workers’ expectations” given inflation is coming down faster than expected and unemployment is rising.
He says workers cannot be blamed for inflation:
What we must not fall into is the argument somehow inflation is always the workers fault … never international factors, never the profit share a company might take, never what a business might do with their own pricing, always the workers fault.
I think people had enough of that and the last two years, the evidence is now in that that is not what has been happening because we have able to get wages up while inflation is moderating.

International medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has posted an update on the situation at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. On X, MSF wrote:

Gaza update: Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza, was shelled in the early hours of this morning, despite Israeli Forces having told medical staff and patients they could remain in the facility. Thousands of displaced people were ordered to evacuate it on 13 February ...
Following shelling this morning, our staff reported a chaotic situation, with an undetermined number of people killed and injured. Since the attack, one of our colleagues remains unaccounted for …Our medical staff have had to flee the hospital, leaving patients behind. Israeli Forces set up a checkpoint to screen people leaving the compound; one of our colleagues was detained at this checkpoint. We call for his safety and the protection of his dignity …Israeli Forces are currently carrying out operations in Nasser hospital. We call on them to immediately stop this attack, as it endangers medical staff and patients who are still stuck inside the facility.”
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, speaking to the Arab League, said Brazil had condemned the Hamas attack on Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, but he added that the Israel’s response was “disproportional and indiscriminate” and unacceptable.
“The killing must be stopped,” the Brazilian leader said, adding Palestine should be recognized as a sovereign state and admitted to the United Nations as a full member, and he called for reform of the U.N. Security Council.
“The multilateral institutions that were created to help solve these problems do not work, which is why Brazil is committed to making the necessary changes in global governance bodies, and we hope to count on Egypt’s support,” he said to reporters alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
Lula said the permanent Security Council should be expanded and its veto powers abolished. “It is the permanent members of the Security Council that foment wars,” he said.
Brazil has supported South Africa’s case brought before the International Court of Justice against the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, he added.
It has just gone 5pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv, and 6pm in Damascus. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
International medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) reported a “chaotic situation” at Nasser hospital and said its medical staff “have had to flee the hospital, leaving patients behind”. It also said one of its colleagues remained unaccounted for after Israeli forces shelled the hospital in the early hours of Thursday and another colleagues was detained at a checkpoint that Israeli Forces had set up “to screen people leaving the compound”. MSF said “we call for his safety and the protection of his dignity” and urged Israeli forces to stop “this attack”.
Israeli military confirmed its special forces were inside Nasser hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis on Thursday, saying it had “credible intelligence” that the bodies of hostages taken on 7 October may be in the facility.
IDF spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari, said forces were conducting a “precise and limited” operation in Nasser hospital and would not forcibly evacuate medics or patients but Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said Israel had launched a “massive incursion” with heavy shooting that injured many of the displaced people who had sheltered there. He said the military had ordered medics to move all patients into an older building that was not properly equipped for their treatment. “Many cannot evacuate, such as those with lower limb amputations, severe burns, or the elderly,” he said in an interview with the Al Jazeera network.
Videos that Reuters verified on Thursday as having been filmed inside Nasser hospital, though it could not verify when, reportedly showed scenes of chaos and terror. Men walked through dark corridors using the lights from their phones, with plaster dust swirling around and debris lying in the corridors, at one point wheeling a bed through a damaged area. At one point in a video gunshots rang out and a doctor shouted “Is there anyone still inside? There is gunfire, there is gunfire – heads down”.
Israeli forces fired into the main hospital in southern Gaza early on Thursday, killing a patient and wounding six others, according to medics. Dr Khaled Alserr, one of the remaining surgeons at Nasser hospital, told the Associated Press that the seven patients struck early on Thursday were already being treated for past wounds. On Wednesday, a doctor was lightly wounded when a drone opened fire on the upper stories of the hospital, he said, adding that “the situation is escalating every hour and every minute”.
Cashflows at the UN agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) will turn negative next month and its financial problems will accelerate in April if funding suspended by a number of countries does not resume, the head of the agency said on Thursday before a meeting in Dublin with the country’s foreign minister.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) reported “very intense shelling” in the vicinity of the al-Amal hospital overnight on Wednesday in an update to its X account.
More Israeli strikes were reported in south Lebanon on Thursday as Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati condemned the escalation. Government institutions, schools and Lebanese University were to close on Thursday in protest of the airstrikes.
Israeli military said Thursday’s strikes in Lebanon targeted Hezbollah infrastructure and launch posts. Spokesperson Avi Hyman from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said: “Our message to Hezbollah has and always will be: Don’t try us”. Senior Hezbollah official Sheikh Nabil Kaouk said at an event on Thursday in southern Lebanon that the militant group was “prepared for the possibility of expanding the war”.
Senior Hezbollah official and member of parliament Hassan Fadlallah said on Thursday that Israel would face reprisal after two sets of strikes on southern Lebanon the previous day killed 10 civilians, half of them children. “The enemy [Israel] will pay the price for these crimes,” Fadlallah told Reuters when asked about the armed group’s reaction.
The UN peacekeeping force deployed along the Lebanon-Israel border, known as Unifil, expressed concerns over the latest “exchanges of fire,” and urged all sides involved to halt hostilities to prevent further escalation. “Attacks targeting civilians are violations of international law and constitute war crimes,” Unifil’s spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said in a statement. “The devastation, loss of life, and injuries witnessed are deeply concerning.”
Israel’s vow to push ahead with a “powerful” operation in Gaza’s Rafah was met with a growing chorus of international condemnation on Thursday, with leaders warning against catastrophic consequences for the 1.5 million Palestinians trapped there. Australia, Canada and New Zealand warned Israel “not to go down this path”, issuing a rare joint statement in the latest urgent appeal seeking to avert further mass civilian casualties. “An expanded military operation would be devastating,” they said. “There is simply nowhere else for civilians to go.”
Israel on Thursday toned down its criticism of the Vatican, saying that remarks by Pope Francis’ deputy on the killings in Gaza were “regrettable” rather than “deplorable”. Cardinal secretary of state Pietro Parolin had said that Israel’s military response to the Hamas militant group was disproportionate and caused “carnage”. A day later, Israel’s embassy to the Holy See criticised Parolin’s “deplorable statement” but on Thursday, the embassy said it should have used the word “regrettable”, and that the mix-up was the result of an imprecise translation.
Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich has rejected plans for an establishment of a Palestinian state, writing on X that Israel “won’t agree in any way” to it. Israel’s national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir also posted on X. He wrote: “1,400 are murdered and the world wants to give them a state. Not going to happen. The establishment of a Palestinian state means the establishment of a Hamas state.”
Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva criticised Israeli action in Gaza saying its ‘behaviour has no explanation’. On Thursday, he said that multilateral institutions were failing to resolve international conflicts. “Israel’s behavior has no explanation: with the pretext of fighting Hamas, it is killing women and children,” he said after a meeting with Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
The 22 Arab countries at the UN are urging the UN security council to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and unhindered humanitarian assistance, and to prevent any transfer of Palestinians out of the territory. The Arab Group chair this month, Tunisia’s UN ambassador Tarek Ladeb, told UN reporters on Wednesday that about 1.5 million Palestinians who sought safety in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah face a “catastrophic scenario” if Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu goes ahead with a potential evacuation of civilians and military offensive in the area bordering Egypt.
Humanitarian officials stressed that states and especially Israel could not “offload” responsibility for the horrors unfolding in Gaza on to aid workers. The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross Mirjana Spoljaric told a Geneva briefing for diplomats on events in Gaza that their countries were responsible for ensuring the Geneva conventions are upheld.
US Central Command (Centcom) said on Thursday its forces carried out four strikes on Wednesday in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen where the Iran-backed militia had been preparing to target ships in the Red Sea.
The latest UNRWA situation report on the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, said that 156 UNRWA colleagues had been killed and 153 UNRWA installations damaged since 7 October 2023 (up to 12 February 2024). It also said there are 1.7 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in UNRWA installations, since 7 October 2023.
Al Jazeera correspondent Ismail Abu Omar, who was seriously injured in an Israeli airstrike that allegedly targeted him and his camera operator, Ahmad Matar, is now in intensive care after his health deteriorated says the news organisation.

Israel on Thursday toned down its criticism of the Vatican, saying that remarks by Pope Francis’ deputy on the killings in Gaza were “regrettable” rather than “deplorable”, reports Reuters.
Cardinal secretary of state Pietro Parolin had said that Israel’s military response to the Hamas militant group was disproportionate and caused “carnage”. A day later, Israel’s embassy to the Holy See criticised Parolin’s “deplorable statement” and said the Palestinian militant group Hamas bore all the blame for the death and destruction in Gaza.
But on Thursday, the embassy said it should have used the word “regrettable”, and that the mix-up was the result of an imprecise translation.
Pope Francis has regularly condemned violence across the Middle East and beyond. But any comments involving Israel have particular historical and cultural sensitivities, built up over centuries.
Relations between the Vatican and Israel have grown increasingly tense since the start of the war in Gaza, with Jewish groups accusing Pope Francis of failing to describe the invasion of Gaza as an act of self-defence after the 7 October Hamas attacks.
The Israeli embassy said on Thursday the original English text of its statement had used the word “regrettable” and its staff had translated that into “deplorevole” in the Italian version they released.
“A more precise” Italian translation would have been “sfortunata”, the embassy said, a word which means something more like unfortunate.
More Israeli strikes were reported in south Lebanon on Thursday as Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati condemned the escalation, reports AP.“At a time where we are insisting on calm and call all sides to not escalate, we find the Israeli enemy extending its aggression,” read a statement from his office.
The Israeli military said Thursday’s strikes targeted Hezbollah infrastructure and launch posts. Lebanese state media said Israel’s air force carried out strikes near the border towns of Labbouneh, Wadi Slouqi, Majdal Selm and Houla, according to the state-run National News Agency (NNA).The Israeli army would continue to respond to Hezbollah’s regular attacks, said spokesperson Avi Hyman from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. “Our message to Hezbollah has and always will be: Don’t try us.”The UN peacekeeping force deployed along the Lebanon-Israel border, known as Unifil, expressed concerns over the latest “exchanges of fire,” and urged all sides involved to halt hostilities to prevent further escalation.“Attacks targeting civilians are violations of international law and constitute war crimes,” Unifil’s spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said in a statement. “The devastation, loss of life, and injuries witnessed are deeply concerning.”Senior Hezbollah official Sheikh Nabil Kaouk said at an event on Thursday in southern Lebanon that the militant group was “prepared for the possibility of expanding the war” and would meet “escalation with escalation, displacement with displacement, and destruction with destruction.”Government institutions, schools and Lebanese University were to close on Thursday in protest of the airstrikes.

Algeria, the Arab representative on the Security Council, circulated a draft resolution about two weeks ago demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access, as well as rejecting the forced displacement of Palestinian civilians, which has been the subject of intense discussions.US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said last week that the resolution could jeopardise “sensitive negotiations” aimed at achieving a pause in the Israel-Hamas war and release of some hostages taken during Hamas’ 7 October attack in southern Israel.Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian UN ambassador, said Wednesday that there is “massive support” for the resolution and Arab diplomats have had “very frank discussions” with the US ambassador, trying to get US support.“We believe that it is high time now for the security council to decide on a humanitarian ceasefire resolution after 131 days,” he said. “The space is narrowing for those who are continuing to ask for more time.”Some Arab countries were pushing for a vote on the Algerian draft this week, but several Arab and council diplomats said a vote is now likely early next week, giving more time for negotiations with the US to avoid a veto. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions have been private, say AP.
Humanitarian chiefs stressed that states and especially Israel could not “offload” responsibility for the horrors unfolding in Gaza onto aid workers.
The Red Cross chief Mirjana Spoljaric told a Geneva briefing for diplomats on events in Gaza that their countries were responsible for ensuring the Geneva conventions are upheld.
“It is not in your interest to offload (that) responsibility... on to humanitarian actors,” she said.
“If the way operations are conducted today limit our operational space to a minimum... we will not be able to resolve the problem,” she added.
“It doesn’t make sense to criticise humanitarian actors for not doing more. You have to enable us to do more.”
Christopher Lockyear, head of the medical charity Doctors Without Borders, agreed.
In the current situation, “when we are talking about humanitarian assistance, we’re talking about an illusion of aid,” he said.
UN aid chief Martin Griffiths warned the diplomats not to “look to the humanitarian community as a rescue brigade for the people compressed into that area” in southern Gaza.
“Conditions do not allow it,” he said.
“It will not be our fault if people suffer,” he said. “It will be the fault of those who decide to make this happen.”
Videos that Reuters verified on Thursday as having been filmed inside Nasser hospital, though it could not verify when, reportedly showed scenes of chaos and terror.

At one point in a video gunshots rang out and a doctor shouted “Is there anyone still inside? There is gunfire, there is gunfire - heads down”.
Speaking about the hospital raid, Israeli military spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari said “this sensitive operation was prepared with precision and is being conducted by IDF special forces who underwent specified training”.
Here is a map from the Guardian’s graphics team showing where the reported Israeli ground operations are taking place in the southern Gaza Strip. It also highlights where Nasser hospital in Khan Younis is located.
Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said on Thursday that multilateral institutions are failing to resolve international conflicts and criticised Israeli actions in Gaza, reports Reuters.
“Israel’s behavior has no explanation: with the pretext of fighting Hamas, it is killing women and children,” he said after a meeting with Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
Lula said there would not be peace without the establishment of a Palestinian state and called for an immediate ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.
The UN relief and works agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) published its latest situation report on the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.

367,422 families outside of shelters have received flour in middle areas and southern governates since 21 November 2023.
Only six out of 23 UNRWA health care centres were operational (according to a partial update on 5 February due to security and internet connectivity issues).
20,460 patients received healthcare in six (out of 23) UNRWA health care centres and shelters (according to a partial update on 5 February due to security and internet connectivity issues).
As per an update on 16 January, seven water wells continue to operate pumping approximately 3,000 cubic metres of water.
Solid waste management continues in Rafah and Khan Younis and partially in Middle Areas, where approximately 45 truck loadings were transferred to temporary sites.
Israel has formally complained to the Vatican after its number two spoke of the “carnage” in Gaza by what he termed a disproportionate Israeli military operation after the 7 October Hamas attacks.The Israeli embassy to the Holy See called the comments by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, “deplorable.” In a statement on Wednesday, the embassy said he hadn’t considered what it said were the relevant facts on which to judge the legitimacy of Israel’s actions.Speaking on Monday at a reception, Parolin had condemned the 7 October attacks against Israel and all forms of antisemitism. But he questioned Israel’s claim to be acting in self-defence by inflicting “carnage” on Gaza.“Israel’s right to self-defence has been invoked to justify that this operation is proportional, but with 30,000 dead, it’s not,” he said.In its statement, the Israeli embassy accused Hamas of turning the Gaza Strip into “the biggest terrorist base ever seen.” It said Israeli armed forces were acting according to international law and said the proportion of Palestinian civilians to “terrorists” killed was less than in other conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.But in a front-page editorial on Thursday entitled “Stop the Carnage,” the Vatican’s editorial director Andrea Tornielli doubled down on the Vatican position. Tornielli quoted a Rome-based Holocaust survivor, Edith Bruck, who has been highly critical of the Israeli government’s response, which she has blamed for the rise in antisemitic acts against Jews around the world.
The Israeli military said it had “credible intelligence” that Hamas had held hostages at the hospital and that the remains of hostages might still be inside, reports AP.
IDF spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari, said forces were conducting a “precise and limited” operation there and would not forcibly evacuate medics or patients. Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals and other civilian structures to shield its fighters.Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said Israel had launched a “massive incursion” with heavy shooting that injured many of the displaced people who had sheltered there.

Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich has rejected plans for an establishment of a Palestinian state, saying Israel “won’t agree in any way” to it.
On his X account on Thursday, Smotrich posted a screenshot of a headline from the Israeli news website Ynet that translates as “report: US promotes comprehensive plan for establishment of Palestinian state” and wrote:
We won’t agree in any way to this plan which actually says that the Palestinians deserve a reward for the terrible massacre they did to us: a Palestinian state whose capital is Jerusalem. The message is that it really pays off to massacre Israeli citizensA Palestinian state is an existential threat for the state of Israel as was proven on the 7 October, Kfar Saba won’t be Kfar Aza!”

Israeli special forces are operating inside Nasser hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, the military said on Thursday, saying it had credible information that the bodies of hostages taken on 7 October may be in the facility reports Reuters.
“We conduct precise rescue operations – as we have in the past – where our intelligence indicates that the bodies of hostages may be held,” the military said in a statement.
Senior Hezbollah official and member of parliament Hassan Fadlallah said on Thursday that Israel would face reprisal after two sets of strikes on southern Lebanon the previous day killed 10 civilians, half of them children.

"Israel has gone ‘beyond self-defence’ in Gaza, says Labour’s Streeting",2024-02-19,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/19/israel-has-gone-beyond-self-defence-in-gaza-says-labour-shadow-minister,"Frontbencher says party considering its options on SNP-led Commons vote on ceasefire later this week
Israel has gone “beyond reasonable self-defence” in its attack on Gaza, a Labour frontbencher has said, as the party prepares for a potentially difficult Commons vote on the crisis later this week.
Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said it was possible that Israel had broken international law in its military campaign, which has killed more than 28,000 people in Gaza since the 7 October massacre of Israelis by Hamas.
Streeting said Labour had yet to decide how it would respond to an Scottish National party-led motion on calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, which is due to be debated on Wednesday.
He told Sky News: “We want to see a ceasefire, of course we do. And we have been increasingly concerned, as the wider international community has been, with the disproportionate loss of civilian life in Gaza.
“Israel has a responsibility to get its hostages back, every country in the world has a right to defend itself. But I think what we have seen are actions that go beyond reasonable self-defence and also call into question whether Israel has broken international law. The ICJ [international court of justice] are now investigating and we take all of that seriously.”
Asked if he thought Israel had gone beyond what was proportionate, Streeting replied: “I think, objectively, yes, Israel has gone too far. And we have seen that with a disproportionate loss of innocent civilian life.”
Labour has thus far refused to call for an immediate ceasefire, using slightly more cautious language about the need for an end to fighting that would be sustainable.
However, as the death toll in Gaza has mounted, and with a number of Labour MPs openly calling for a ceasefire, the party’s stance has gradually shifted, with Streeting’s comments among the toughest yet.
Speaking to the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow on Sunday, Keir Starmer said the “fighting must stop now” in Gaza, and he warned Israel not to extend its military offensive to the southern city of Rafah.
In another interview, with Talk TV, Streeting said Labour was considering its options on the SNP vote.
He said: “We’ll see what the final motion looks like. We’re considering our own options on this – we all want to see a ceasefire. We’ve seen an intolerable loss of innocent civilian life during the course of this war. But we’re not going to be pushed around by protesters, and we’re not going to be told what to say by our opponents in parliament either.”
In a vote on a similar SNP motion in November, in the form of an amendment to the king’s speech, 56 Labour MPs defed the party whip to back it, with eight frontbenchers stepping down to do so, including Jess Phillips.
Streeting told Times Radio that Labour had “taken a lot of criticism within the Muslim community certainly, but also more broadly” over its position.
He said: “I am not the only person in this country who has shed tears looking at images of the bodies of children and innocent civilians coming out of Gaza. So I understand why people are vocal in calling for a ceasefire.”

Middle East crisis: EU launches maritime security operation as cargo ship damaged in Red Sea after missiles fired from Yemen – as it happened,2024-02-19,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/19/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-gaza-war-latest-news-updates-idf-rafah-attack-hostages-not-released-hamas-benny-gantz-benjamin-netanyahu-un-who-nasser-hospital,"Defensive maritime security operation launched in Red Sea and Gulf as crew evacuated from Belize-flagged ship and UK maritime body reports another attack
The Council of the EU launched today a defensive maritime security operation to safeguard freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and the Gulf.
In a statement, the Council said:
Operation ASPIDES will ensure an EU naval presence in the area where numerous Houthi attacks have targeted international commercial vessels since October 2023.
In close cooperation with like-minded international partners, ASPIDES will contribute to safeguard maritime security and ensure freedom of navigation, especially for merchant and commercial vessels.
Within its defensive mandate, the operation will provide maritime situational awareness, accompany vessels, and protect them against possible multi-domain attacks at sea.
The operation will be active along the main sea lines of communication in the Baab al-Mandab Strait and the strait of Hormuz, as well as international waters in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman, and the Persian Gulf.
It has just gone 5pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here are the headlines …
The Council of the EU launched a defensive maritime security operation to safeguard freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and the Gulf. It said Operation ASPIDES would ensure an EU naval presence in the area where numerous Houthi attacks have targeted international commercial vessels since October 2023. The Belize-flagged cargo ship Rubymar sustained damage overnight after two missiles were fired at the vessel from Yemen, although the crew were able to evacuate.
The foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority has told the International Court of Justice in The Hague that “There is a genocide happening in Gaza” and that occupation of Palestinian territory by Israel should come to “an unconditional end”. Riyad al-Maliki was speaking as a week of hearings in the UN’s top court has opened on the legal consequences of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories. In its submission on the case, made in July 2023, Israel argueed that any decision or arbitration by the court risks endangering the previously agreed peace process.
Israel has declared Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva “persona non grata” over comments he made accusing Israel of carrying out a genocide and comparing their actions to the Holocaust. Israel’s foreign minister Israel Katz said “We will not forget nor forgive. It is a serious antisemitic attack.”
The health ministry in Gaza has said the number of Palestinians killed in the territory by Israeli military action since 7 October has risen to 29,092. In the past 24 hours, 107 Palestinians were killed and 145 injured, the Hamas-led ministry said in its statement. 69,028 are reported injured in total. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify casualty figures being issued during the conflict.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society has reported “multiple bombardments by Israeli forces” near the al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis which it claims have caused “significant damage to the hospital building”.
In its latest operational update, Israel’s military has said it continues operations in Khan Younis, claiming to have located “AK-47s, drones, an RPG, explosive devices, and additional military equipment were located.”
EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said “everyone is afraid” Benjamin Netanyahu will give the go ahead to a military offensive in Rafah in southern Gaza in the coming days despite mounting international pressure to resist. Ireland’s foreign minister Micheál Martin has said it would be “unconscionable” if Israel were to go ahead with a bombardment of Rafah.
Majed Al Ansari, a spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry, has criticised the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu’s recent comments calling on Qatar to pressure Hamas to release hostages, saying they are “a new attempt to stall and prolong the war for reasons that have become obvious to everyone.”
Netanyahu’s office has confirmed Israel will continue to restrict who can worship at the al-Asqa mosque in Jerusalem when Ramadan starts in March. Hamas has described the move as “religious warfare”.
Reuters reports that interior security minister Itamar Ben Gvir, a far-right coalition partner in Benjamin Netanyahu government, has continued to lend his vocal support to restrictions on Friday prayers at al-Aqsa mosque during the month of Ramadan. [See 11.57 GMT]
Israel has already been restricting access to the site every Friday since the 7 October Hamas attack.
The news agency reports Ben Gvir said those who hate Israel would use the event to show support for the Hamas leadership and incite violence.
“The entry of tens of thousands of haters in a victory celebration on the Temple Mount is a security threat to Israel,” Ben Gvir said.
Ben Gvir, on social media, directly linked the ability of Jews to visit the Temple Mount to the attacks on 7 October. In a message he said:
3 Oct – they asked me not to go up to the Temple Mount because they were afraid of Hamas and I respected their request.
7 Oct – the largest massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust.
19 Feb – The idea returns.
Victory is brought by determination and strength, not by folding and surrendering.
Earlier Netanyahu’s office confirmed the continuing restrictions, and said: “The prime minister made a balanced decision to allow freedom of worship within the security needs determined by professionals.”
Ramadan is expected to begin on 10 March.
Reuters reports that in a statement Hamas has condemend the move, saying it is “a continuation of Zionist criminality and religious warfare led by the extremist settlers group in the terrorist occupation government against our Palestinian people”. It called on Palestinians to mobilise against the restrictions.
Religious leaders in the Palestinian territory have also ordered people to protect the right to use the mosque, with the Wafa news agency reporting they had urged “everyone who can reach al-Aqsa mosque to travel to it and protect it, as al-Aqsa mosque is an Islamic endowment for Muslims of the entire world, hoping that ‘they will not hesitate to defend it with whatever capabilities they have.’”
The Palestine Red Crescent Society has reported “multiple bombardments by Israeli forces” near the al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis which it claims have caused “significant damage to the hospital building”.

In its submission to the ICJ, Morocco has said it hopes any opinion by the court will promote a peaceful solution. Noting the role the country has played in promoting peaceful coexistance of faiths in Jerusalam, and the 2019 “Al-Quds/Jerusalem Appeal” signed jointly by Morocco’s King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis, the submission concludes:
The Kingdom of Morocco expresses the hope that any advisory opinion that the court may give will promote a constructive peace dynamic, with a view to an applicable, equitable and lasting solution, satisfying the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to an independent, viable and sovereign State on the basis of the borders of 4 June 1967, with Al-Quds/East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side with the state of Israel, in peace and security and allowing the peoples of the region to live in peace, security, stability and dignity.
Italy’s written submission to the ICJ has been published, and it is asking the court to use discretion and not rule on the issue. The submission was made on 25 July 2023, and in it Italy states:
The government of the Italian Republic follows with great concern recent developments, marked by a lack of progress, unilateral actions, further deterioration in trust between the parties and phases of increased violence. This state of things, however, only highlights the essentially political nature of the matter, which can only be solved through negotiations.
The goverment of the Italian Republic recalls that Article 65, para 1 of its Statute gives the court the power to decline to render an opinion
…
The government of the Italian Republic considers that this is a pertinent point in the present case and respectfully encourages the court to consider using such discretion, bearing in mind the essentially political nature of the matter and the established legal framework for the resolution of the conflict.
In particular, Italy is cognizant of the risk that an advisory opinion by the court might reduce the flexibility of the parties in dealing with present circumstances and long-term prospects, and therefore would not contribute to move the process closer to a mutually agreed solution.
The document goes on to say that if the court decides to offer an opinion, Italy asks the court to consider carefully “the parties’ ability to negotiate peace and a two-state solution consistent with the framework established in UN security council resolutions and adopted in the agreements of the parties.”
The ICJ has published a series of documents associated with the case it was hearing today concerning Israel’s policy on the occupied Palestinian territories.
As well as Israel’s response to the case [See 13.25 GMT], it has published the submission from the Palestinian side.
The Palestinian Authority may not hold out much hope that the case will materially affect things on the ground – Israel has ignored earlier findings by the court – but it has afforded the opportunity to catalogue Israel’s expansion from 1948 to the territory it effectively exercises control over today and state its case in public. Israel has been occupying the West Bank since 1967.
The submission runs to 390 pages, including highly detailed maps of where Israel has established settlements, and quotes from Israeli authorities about their intentions on sovereignty, which includes explicitly ruling out, for example, the deoccupation of East Jerusalem. You can read it in full here.
Noa Shpigel reports for Haaretz that Israel’s finance minister has said his country should unilaterally withdraw from the Oslo accords if a Palestinian state was declared by any means not including negotiation with Israel.
Haaretz quotes Bezalel Smotrich saying:
I call on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to explicitly announce that unilateral measures will be met with unilateral measures, [and] faced with any unilateral step taken against the state of Israel, Israel will act unilaterally to cancel the Oslo accords, [and] to completely and immediately stop all funds transferred to the Palestinian Authority, and to completely dissolve the Palestinian Authority.
The ICJ in The Hague has published Israel’s written response to the case that is being heard today, on the ‘policies and practices of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory’. In it, Israel argues that any decision or arbitration by the court risks endangering the previously agreed peace process.
The response was submitted on 24 July 2023. In it, Israel claims the case represents “a clear distortion of the history and present reality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict” arguing the court is being asked to “presume Israeli violations of international law” and that the “prejudicial nature of the questions” disregard “thousands of dead and wounded Israelis who have fallen victim to murderous Palestinian acts of hatred and terrorism”.
It goes on to say that “Israel, as an interested party, has not given its consent to judicial settlement of its dispute with the Palestinian side”, arguing that “both sides, and the intemational community as a whole, continue to affirm the validity of the terms of reference and established legal framework embodied” in previous agreements, which Israel says “the two sides have agreed to resolve through direct negotiations precisely the subject-matter placed before the court”.
It says the case is asking for “an intervention by the Court in a manner manifestly inconsistent with its judicial function and prior pronouncements”, and goes on to say:
Most alarmingly, they risk fundamentally delegitimizing the established legal framework governing the conflict and any future prospect of negotiations between Israelis and the Palestinians, which remains – as the court itself has observed – the only viable path to peace.
While the request made to the court seeks to portray it as such, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not a cartoon narrative of villain and victim in which there are no Israeli rights and no Palestinian obligations. Entertaining such a falsehood can only push the parties further apart rather than help create conditions to bring them closer together.
For all the difficulties and obstacles that exist, Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation will not be served by further undermining the core understanding that this is a tragic conflict in which two sides – not just one – have rights and responsibilities.
In these circumstances, to engage with the subject-matter of the request placed before the Court as though this is an appropriate use of the advisory function would not just be unwarranted; it would be harmful. Israel hopes and expects that the court, in safeguarding its judicial integrity as well as the established legal framework governing the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and its negotiated resolution, will respond accordingly.
The document is signed by ambassador Modi Ephraim, Israel’s ambassador to the Netherlands. You can read the document in full here.
Spain says it will impose unilateral sanctions on violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank if its EU partners fail to reach an agreement on the issue.
Reuters reports foreign minister José Manuel Albares made the comments on Monday.
Ireland’s foreign minister Micheál Martin had earlier expressed regret that “unity and unanimity” still hadn’t occurred within the foreign affairs council, adding “Ireland favours sanctions on violent settlers in the West Bank”
Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that today alone Israeli authorities have issued a demolition order against a sport club and a primary school in the town of Al-Issawiya, north of Jerusalem, bulldozed a 500m strip of Palestinian land for road-building near occupied Bethlehem, and that would-be settlers have fenced off a large tract of Palestinian-owned land in the Batn al-Hawa neighbourhood in the town of Silwan, and damaged about ten Palestinian-owned vehicles in the town of Huwwara in an overnight attack.

The ICJ hearing has ended for today.
The court will hold a session tomorrow at 10am CET to hear views from a range of countries, including South Africa, Algeria and the Netherlands.
Majed Al Ansari, a spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry, has criticised the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
In a post on social media, the Qatari spokesperson said ""the Israeli prime minister’s recent statements calling on Qatar to pressure Hamas to release the hostages are nothing but a new attempt to stall and prolong the war for reasons that have become obvious to everyone.”
He added that “we categorically reject the empty accusations made by the Israeli Prime Minister regarding Qatari efforts in reconstruction and humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people in Gaza.”
The spokesperson also said “we affirm that Qatar will continue its mediation efforts and will not be deterred by rhetoric and statements that can only be understood in the context of escaping from the Israeli Prime Minister’s personal political challenges.”

At the ICJ hearing, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, said that “Israeli leaders no longer feel the need to hide their intensions.”
“They defy the law, and the law is barely fighting back,” he said.
His voice breaking, he added:
What does international law mean for Palestinian children in Gaza today? It has protected neither them nor their childhood, it has not protected their families or communities.
Mansour also said:
Palestinians under occupation in Israel, as refugees and in the diaspora, all they ask for are their rights, and to live in freedom and dignity in their ancestral land.
For 75 years, the Palestinian people have faced attempts to push them out of geography, and indeed out of history.
And it goes on.
And it will go on forever, unless and until international law is upheld.
Unless and until the unlawful occupation of Palestine ends.
It is 1pm in The Hague, 2pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv, and 3pm in Sana’a. Here are the latest headlines …
The foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority has told the International Court of Justice in The Hague that “There is a genocide happening in Gaza” and that occupation of Palestinian territory by Israel should come to “an unconditional end”. Riyad al-Maliki was speaking as a week of hearings in the UN’s top court has opened on the legal consequences of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, with more than 50 states due to address the judges. In her evidence, Dr Namira Negm said “Starting from the Nakba in 1948, Israel has adopted discriminatory legislation measures which has established a deeply entrenched system of racial discrimination against Palestinians.”
The Belize-flagged cargo ship Rubymar sustained damaged after two missiles were fired at the vessel from Yemen, although the crew were able to evacuate, the vessel’s security company has said. “There is nobody on board now,” the spokesperson said. “The owners and mangers are considering options for towage”. Another incident was reported to UKMTO later in the day, with no reports of casualties.
Israel has declared Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva a “persona non grata” over comments he made in which he accused Israel of carrying out a genocide in Gaza which he compared to the actions of Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust. Having summoned Brazil’s ambassador for a reprimand, Israel’s foreign minister Israel Katz issued a statement saying: “We will not forget nor forgive. It is a serious antisemitic attack. In my name and the name of the citizens of Israel – tell president Lula that he is persona non grata in Israel until he takes it back”. At the weekend, Brazil’s president had said “what is happening in the Gaza Strip and to the Palestinian people hasn’t been seen in any other moment in history. Actually, it did when Hitler decided to kill the Jews.
The health ministry in Gaza has said the number of Palestinians killed in the territory by Israeli military action since 7 October has risen to 29,092. In the past 24 hours, 107 Palestinians were killed and 145 injured, the Hamas-led ministry said in its statement. 69,028 are reported injured in total. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify casualty figures being issued during the conflict.
Fighting, fuel shortages and Israeli raids have put Gaza’s largest still functioning hospital completely out of service, local and UN health officials have said, as Israel continued its threats to invade the southern city of Rafah if remaining Israeli hostages are not freed in the next three weeks. In its latest operational update, Israel’s military has said it continues operations in Khan Younis, claiming to have located “AK-47s, drones, an RPG, explosive devices, and additional military equipment were located.”
EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said “everyone is afraid” Benjamin Netanyahu will give the go ahead to a military offensive in Rafah in southern Gaza in the coming days despite mounting international pressure to resist. Ireland’s foreign minister Micheál Martin has said it would be “unconscionable” if Israel were to go ahead with a bombardment of Rafah.
Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that this morning Israeli forces “accompanied by military bulldozers” have razed ground in the village of Husan, west of occupied Bethlehem, to prepare for road-building. It reports that 500m of “citizens’ lands at the eastern entrance to the village” was destroyed.
Netanyahu’s office have confirmed that Monday morning Israel’s prime minister met Democratic US senators Chris Coons and Richard Blumenthal.
I am handing you over to my colleague Lili Bayer for an hour. You can watch the proceedings at The Hague in this video feed …
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has confirmed that Israel will impose security restrictions on Friday prayers at Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque during Ramadan.
Netanyahu’s office said: “The prime minister made a balanced decision to allow freedom of worship within the security needs determined by professionals.”
Israel has restricted access to the site since 7 October, often forcing Palestinians to hold Friday prayers on streets near the mosque at security checkpoints while some elderly worshippers are admitted to the site.
Israel has offered no details as yet as what the restrictions will be. The month of Ramadan begins on 10 March.
Palestinian news agency Wafa has reported a response to the move from religious leaders in Palestine, writing that they believe “the decision aims to empty the al-Aqsa mosque of Muslim worshippers, in implementation of the plan to Judaize it, and build their alleged temple” and describing it as “an extension of the comprehensive war waged by the occupation forces against everything that is Palestinian.”
Here is a little bit from Jeremy Sharon’s Times of Israel report on proceedings in The Hague earlier today, which outlines more of Paul Reichler’s presentation, in which he specifically cited comments by named Israeli officials. Sharon wrote:
Reichler describes the residence of some 700,000 Israelis in West Bank settlements and East Jerusalem neighborhoods as “a vast colonial enterprise” in which he alleges that Israel has “implanted settlers” as part of a goal of permanent annexation.
He also shows the court a picture of a map of the region used by Netanyahu in a speech to the UN general assembly in September 2023 where Israel is depicted as including all the territory west of the Jordan River with no demarcation at all of the West Bank as evidence that Israel seeks to “eliminate all traces of Palestine.”
He cites Netanyahu’s declared goal from 2019 of annexing the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, as well as finance minister Bezalel Smotrich saying that it was “a national ambition” to control the West Bank from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea,” which, he said, “was an established fact and not open to negotiation.”

"Keir Starmer risks biggest rebellion of his leadership over Gaza vote, MPs warn",2024-02-19,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/19/keir-starmer-risks-biggest-rebellion-of-his-leadership-over-gaza-vote-mps-warn,"Labour backbenchers urge party not to whip them against SNP’s motion calling for immediate ceasefire
Keir Starmer risks triggering the biggest rebellion of his leadership if he tries to stop his MPs voting on Wednesday for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, backbenchers have warned.
Labour MPs are urging their leader not to whip them against voting for a Scottish National party motion this week calling for a ceasefire, three months after a similar vote saw 56 members rebel, including eight frontbenchers.
Party whips have not yet decided how to approach Wednesday’s vote, but several MPs have told the Guardian they risk another damaging internal row if they try to oppose it.
The Scottish Labour party voted this weekend in favour an immediate ceasefire, but Starmer has so far stopped short of backing such a position, saying instead that Israel and Hamas need to “get to” an end to the fighting.
One Labour MP said: “I suspect it will be far more than the 56 who [rebelled] last time, especially given the Scottish Labour position and how many more MPs are really under pressure on this now.”
Another said: “I hope we end up in a better position than last time – we need to not get into the same position as last time.”
The Middle East crisis has proven one of the toughest tests of Starmer’s leadership. The Labour leader was criticised in the weeks after the 7 October attack for his strenuous defence of Israel’s military action. Then in November, he suffered the biggest rebellion since becoming leader when dozens of MPs defied orders to vote for an SNP motion calling for an immediate ceasefire.
Last week, Starmer suspended two Labour candidates for making derogatory remarks about Israel during a meeting designed to persuade those upset by his stance on the war not to leave the party. He was accused of acting too slowly to discipline Azhar Ali, however, after the party’s candidate in Rochdale was recorded saying he believed Israel had allowed the 7 October attack to happen as a pretext for war.
The SNP is now seeking to reopen Labour’s wounds with a motion on Wednesday mirroring the one in November. Since then, however, the Labour leadership has changed its position on the war, including calling for a ceasefire, even if not backing a permanent one straight away.
Starmer told the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow this weekend that the “fighting must stop now” in Gaza, warning Israel not to invade the southern city of Rafah, where 1.5 million people are taking refuge.

Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, spurred hope among some Labour MPs that the party’s position was changing further when he said on Monday morning that Israel had gone “beyond reasonable self-defence” in Gaza.
He told Sky News: “We want to see a ceasefire, of course we do. And we have been increasingly concerned, as the wider international community has been, with the disproportionate loss of civilian life in Gaza.
“Israel has a responsibility to get its hostages back, every country in the world has a right to defend itself. But I think what we have seen are actions that go beyond reasonable self-defence and also call into question whether Israel has broken international law. The ICJ [international court of justice] are now investigating and we take all of that seriously.”
Asked if he thought Israel had gone beyond what was proportionate, Streeting replied: “I think, objectively, yes, Israel has gone too far. And we have seen that with a disproportionate loss of innocent civilian life.”
In another interview on TalkTV, however, Streeting said the party’s leadership had not yet decided how to approach Wednesday’s vote.
“We’ll see what the final motion looks like,” he said.“We’re considering our own options on this – we all want to see a ceasefire. We’ve seen an intolerable loss of innocent civilian life during the course of this war.
“But we’re not going to be pushed around by protesters, and we’re not going to be told what to say by our opponents in parliament either.”

Minister says government working on sanction options for those involved in Alexei Navalny’s death – as it happened,2024-02-19,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/feb/19/kemi-badenoch-post-office-scandal-alexei-navalny-uk-politics-live,"Leo Docherty, Foreign Office minister, says government ‘working at pace’ to hold those responsible for Russian opposition leader’s death to account
In the Commons Leo Docherty, a Foreign Office minister, is now making a statement about the death of Alexei Navalny.
He told MPs the government was appalled at the news of Navalny’s death and that he was speaking for the whole house in sending his deepest condolences to Navalny’s family. He went on:
Mr Navalny dedicated his life with great bravery to exposing corruption. He called for free and fair politics and held the Kremlin to account. He was an inspiration to millions and many Russians felt that gave them a voice.
The Russian authorities saw him as a threat. President Putin fear to even speak his name Putin’s Russia imprisoned him on fabricated charges, poisoned him, and sent him to an Arctic penal colony.
Mr Navalny was a man of huge courage and iron will. Even from his remote prison so he persisted in advocating for the rights of the Russian people.
No one should doubt the dreadful nature of the Russian system. Years of mistreatment at the hands of the state at a serious effect on Mr Navalny’s health. His death must be investigated fully and transparently.
Docherty said the Russian authorities should tell Navalny’s family where his body is.
The UK government held the Russian authorities “wholly responsible”, he said.
And, in a reference to possible sanctions, he said that the people to blame should be held to account and that the government was “working at pace” on options to enable this to happen.
Kemi Badenoch has accused the Post Office chair she sacked of a “blatant attempt to seek revenge” after he made explosive allegations about the government’s handling of the Horizon scandal. The business secretary launched an extended attack on Henry Staunton in the Commons on Monday, and claimed that he was under investigation for bullying when she fired him.
The extraordinary war of words began over the weekend after Staunton gave an interview to the Sunday Times accusing the government of wanting to stall compensation payments to victims of the Horizon scandal until after the general election. Badenoch dismissed Staunton from his role last month. In his interview Staunton said that Badenoch told him when she fired him: “Well, someone’s got to take the rap for this.” He also claimed that soon after starting his role in December 2022, he was instructed by a senior civil servant to delay compensation payouts so the Conservatives could “limp into” the general election.
Henry Staunton issued a stinging riposte to Kemi Badenoch on Monday night, saying he had kept a record of the alleged comment from a senior civil servant asking him to stall compensation payments to Horizon victims. A spokesperson for Staunton said he “recorded [it] at the time in a file note, which he emailed to himself and to colleagues and which is therefore traceable on the Post Office server”. The spokesperson said Staunton had never been made aware of any bullying allegations against him and that they were “certainly not raised by the secretary of state at any stage and certainly not during the conversation which led to Mr Staunton’s dismissal. Such behaviour would in any case be totally out of character.”
A Foreign Office minister has ruled out a prisoner swap for the imprisoned Russian opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza, a British citizen, who MPs have expressed concern about after the death of Alexei Navalny. Kara-Murza’s wife was now adamant that she wanted everything to be done to get her her husband out of Russia, said the Conservative backbencher Bob Seely, who urged the government to countenance swapping imprisoned spies for the pro-democracy activist who was now the most high-profile Russian political prisoner. Seely, who is in contact with the Kara-Murza and Navalny families, said when he had discussed prisoners swaps with the Foreign Office it had been made clear to him that such moves only encouraged state hostage taking.
Keir Starmer risks triggering the biggest rebellion of his leadership if he tries to stop his MPs voting on Wednesday for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, backbenchers have warned.

Party whips have not yet decided how to approach Wednesday’s vote, but several MPs have told the Guardian they risk another damaging internal row if they try to oppose it.
Humza Yousaf has accused Labour of behaving like Margaret Thatcher by throwing oil and gas workers “on the scrapheap”, as he announced the Scottish National party would not back proposals for extending the fossil fuel windfall tax. In a campaign speech delivered in Aberdeen, the UK’s oil capital, Scotland’s first minister accused Labour of risking 100,000 jobs after Keir Starmer promised a “proper” windfall tax on oil and gas firms this month when he scaled back his party’s £28bn green investment pledge.
A scheme allowing Ukrainians to join family members taking sanctuary in the UK has been unexpectedly closed, in what opposition politicians described as a cruel and “below the radar” move days before the two-year anniversary of Russia’s full invasion. The Ukraine family scheme is being shut but government officials said a separate Homes for Ukraine scheme would continue to fulfil people’s needs as a way of “simplifying” the process.
Children’s services leaders have called for a national “plan for childhood” to transform the health, emotional wellbeing and life chances of a generation of youngsters scarred by austerity and the pandemic. In a withering assessment of the government’s record over the past few years, they said ministers had presided over deepening child poverty, crumbling schools and an exploding health and wellbeing crisis in young people, with low-income families worst affected.
Israel has gone “beyond reasonable self-defence” in its attack on Gaza, a Labour frontbencher has said, as the party prepares for a potentially difficult Commons vote on the crisis later this week. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said it was possible that Israel had broken international law in its military campaign, which has killed more than 28,000 people in Gaza since the 7 October massacre of Israelis by Hamas.
Ofcom has launched an investigation into whether a GB News programme where Rishi Sunak took questions from the public breached impartiality rules by failing to include other political views. The broadcast watchdog said it had received 500 complaints about People’s Forum: The Prime Minister, held in County Durham on 12 February on Monday last week.
The UK’s chief inspector of borders and immigration has said it is “scandalous” that his watchdog role could be left vacant while the Rwanda scheme is introduced. In a break with the treatment of his predecessors, David Neal has been told he will not serve a second term as chief inspector of borders and immigration. The Times reported that a successor was unlikely to be appointed for at least six months, covering the period when the prime minister has said he hopes the first flights carrying asylum seekers to Rwanda will take off.

They added: “It was in the interests of the business as well as being fair for the postmasters that there was faster progress on exoneration and that compensation for wrongly convicted postmasters was more generous, but we didn’t see any real movement until after the Mr Bates programme. We will leave it to others to come to the conclusion as to why that was the case.”
Earlier this evening, the Conservative MP Lee Anderson accused Labour MPs of supporting “the disgraced Post Office management team” during questions to business secretary Kemi Badenoch over the dismissal of Henry Staunton.
The MP for Ashfield told the Commons:
I am absolutely staggered that the Labour Party now seem to be coming out in support of the disgraced Post Office management team. This by the way is the same management team that oversaw the wrongful imprisonment of postmasters across the country, hundreds of convictions.
So does (Badenoch) agree with me that when push comes to shove that that lot over there would take the side of the grifters not the grafters?
Badenoch responded:
This is one of the reasons as he said where the Post Office leadership had overseen the wrongful convictions, we have had multiple changes and this is just the latest to ensure that we get the right leadership in place.
But as we can see, I know that some of the members opposite are dealing with this properly, but from the heckling we can see that for a lot of them they came here thinking that they could get political points scored and I am not allowing that to happen.
In a low-key visit away from the cameras, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron paid his respects at the Argentine military cemetery, PA Media reported.
The cemetery holds the remains of more than 230 of the 649 Argentinians killed in the conflict.
Labour MP Chris Bryant asked business secretary Kemi Badenoch if she leaked information on the dismissal of Henry Staunton to the media prior to Staunton being himself informed.
“Can I just clarify something about the process of (Staunton’s) dismissal, as I understand it he found out about it from Sky News, I think the Secretary of State just added a piece of information which is that she then rang Sky News, before ringing him I think, to try and get them to stop running it. So she knew that this had already been leaked to Sky News from somebody in her department presumably,” he said.
“What investigation did she go through to find out who that was, that leaked it, is that person still in post, because otherwise one might just worry that it might have been she herself who leaked it.”
Badenoch said: “I knew that someone would ask that question.
“I have in fact evidence to show that I asked Sky News not to run the story. Of course I didn’t leak it because if I had it would have created legal risk if he (Staunton) found out on the news before I had had a chance to speak to him.
“We have no idea how Sky News found out the information, there are several thousand people who work in the Department for Business and Trade, there are many more who work at the Post Office, at UKGI.
“Bryant) is heckling but the point I am making is that leaks are incredibly damaging and harmful, they create legal risks for the department, I did not do so, I made multiple efforts with at least two media outlets to make sure that they did not create problems for Mr Staunton and it is one of the reasons why it is very disappointing to see what he did in the Sunday Times at the weekend.”
Rishi Sunak told his cabinet “we cannot be complacent” about Russia - and the UK together with allies must “intensify” support for Ukraine, in a meeting on Monday.
A Number 10 readout said:
The prime minister led a cabinet discussion, ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He made clear that Putin’s actions remain an existential threat to the very foundations of Euro-Atlantic security and that today, just as much as two years ago, he must not be allowed to succeed.
The prime minister added that two years in, Putin is not winning. Ukraine has re-opened the Black Sea to exports, and Russia has lost over half the territory it originally captured thanks to Ukraine’s combat power.
However, he added we cannot be complacent. He said the UK would remain at the forefront of the international response - building on our leadership as the first to deliver lethal aid, to commit to provide western battle tanks and fighter pilot training, and to sign the historic UK-Ukraine Agreement on Security Cooperation in January. And backed by our commitment of £2.5 billion in military aid this year, our largest package yet, and our 100-year partnership with Ukraine.
It is right to describe Alexei Navalny’s death as murder, a Foreign Office minister has said.
Leo Docherty agreed with the description of the Russian opposition leader’s death after Alicia Kearns, the Conservative chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee said:
Alexei Navalny was murdered and it is important that we in this House call it out for what it was, because that is what he deserves.
Following his murder, I was also in Munich, where I heard his wife, Yulia, (Navalnaya) ask us to stand by her. That is what we must now do.
She urged the USA to follow through on warnings it would act if Navalny were to die, adding:
Biden must now deliver on that threat or we will see more lives taken such as that of Vladimir Kara-Murza.
Docherty replied:
She is right to use the word murder. We do seek to hold the state and the Russian leadership to account.
Of course I can’t comment on the American position but with regard to our policy with regard to Russian state assets, we will continue to look at the appropriate legal path to ensuring that which is frozen might be utilised to bring benefit to those affected by this outrageous and illegal war in Ukraine.
David Cameron has become the first foreign secretary to visit the Falkland Islands in 30 years, in a high-profile demonstration the contested territory is a “part of the British family”, PA Media reports. PA says:
Cameron said that the archipelago’s sovereignty is “not… up for discussion” while the islanders wish to be British, despite fresh calls from Argentina for talks on the future of the islands.
The foreign secretary arrived at Mount Pleasant airbase and will visit some of the key battle sites of the 1982 Falklands War to pay his respects to those who lost their lives in the conflict.
Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, who met Cameron last month, has called for the South Atlantic islands to be handed over to Buenos Aires.
But ahead of his arrival in the UK overseas territory, Cameron said: “The Falkland Islands are a valued part of the British family, and we are clear that as long as they want to remain part of the family, the issue of sovereignty will not be up for discussion.”
That is all from me for today. Tom Ambrose is now taking over.
The war of words on the SNP’s Gaza vote continued today, with Labour’s Scottish secretary Ian Murray telling BBC Radio Scotland this evening that no decision has been taken on whether his party will support Wednesday’s motion.
The UK party is desperate to avoid another rebellion on the issue, as happened last November over a similar SNP vote, and led to the resignation of eight frontbenchers.
Murray said the actual motion had not yet been laid, and added that the SNP should be spending it’s time trying to persuade the government to support them.
Murray also insisted there was “a cigarette paper between” the motion Scottish Labour conference voted for on Saturday, calling for an immediate ceasefire, and Starmer’s call at the same conference on Sunday for the fighting to “stop now”.
But the SNP is continuing to ramp up the pressure on Labour, with Westminster leader Stephen Flynn continuing to offer a meeting to Labour leader Keir Starmer to discuss the vote, but stressing the aim of an immediate ceasefire must not be watered down.
In the Commons the Labour MP Diana Johnson said that what was happening with compensation to victims of the infected blood scandal made it easy to believe that the government was also delaying the payment of compensation to victims of the Post Office scandal. She said:
The allegations of limping towards the general election in terms of delaying compensation payments to postmasters does actually mirror the behaviour of government towards the infected blood scandal.
It seems to me that there is a pattern of behaviour. The government only seem to act when forced to or shamed … into taking any action.
In response, Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, replied:
No, no and no.
I think it’s a shame that [Johnson] would stand up there and say that the government only acted when it was forced to, when she knows that we brought legislation to this House well before the ITV drama.
During her statement to MPs Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, claimed that she had done all she could to stop the news about Henry Staunton being sacked being reported before he found out himself. She said it was “disappointing” that Sky News and the Daily Mail found out what was happening. She said:
It was also disappointing because I had done everything I could to try and keep this out of the news and do it behind closed doors properly.
I made sure, when I gave public statements, that I said I wouldn’t do HR in public. I even, when I found out that it had been leaked to Sky News, called Sky News and asked them, one of my assistants did, to ask them not to put that out in the public domain before I had a chance to speak to Henry Staunton – did the same with the Daily Mail who thankfully did listen.
We also need the media to help us in this and not publish false allegations.
In the Commons Leo Docherty, a Foreign Office minister, is now making a statement about the death of Alexei Navalny.
He told MPs the government was appalled at the news of Navalny’s death and that he was speaking for the whole house in sending his deepest condolences to Navalny’s family. He went on:
Mr Navalny dedicated his life with great bravery to exposing corruption. He called for free and fair politics and held the Kremlin to account. He was an inspiration to millions and many Russians felt that gave them a voice.
The Russian authorities saw him as a threat. President Putin fear to even speak his name Putin’s Russia imprisoned him on fabricated charges, poisoned him, and sent him to an Arctic penal colony.
Mr Navalny was a man of huge courage and iron will. Even from his remote prison so he persisted in advocating for the rights of the Russian people.
No one should doubt the dreadful nature of the Russian system. Years of mistreatment at the hands of the state at a serious effect on Mr Navalny’s health. His death must be investigated fully and transparently.
Docherty said the Russian authorities should tell Navalny’s family where his body is.
The UK government held the Russian authorities “wholly responsible”, he said.
And, in a reference to possible sanctions, he said that the people to blame should be held to account and that the government was “working at pace” on options to enable this to happen.
In her opening statement Kemi Badenoch said that Henry Staunton’s claims in his Sunday Times article were “completely false”. In particular, she addressed three of his specific claims, relating to briefings the media, why he was sacked, and claims compensation was delayed.
Badenoch rejected claims that the media had been pre-briefed about his sacking. She said:
Mr Staunton alleges that I refused to apologise to him after he learned of his dismissal from Sky News. That was not the case.
In the call he referenced I made it abundantly clear that I disapproved of the media briefing any aspect of this story and out of respect for Henry Staunton’s reputation I went to great pains to make my concerns about his conduct private.
In fact in my interviews with the press I repeatedly said that I refused to carry out HR in public. That is why it is so disappointing that he’s chosen to spread a series of falsehoods, provide made up anecdotes to journalists and leak discussions held in confidence.
All of this merely confirms in my mind that I made the correct decision in dismissing him.
She said Staunton was not sacked because, as he claimed she told him, someone had to take the rap for the Horizon scandal. She said:
Mr Staunton claimed I told him that someone’s got to take the rap for the Horizon scandal, and that was the reason for his dismissal. That was not the reason at all.
I dismissed him because there were serious concerns about his behaviour as chair, including those raised from other directors on the board. My department found significant governance issues, for example, with the recruitment of a new senior independent director to the Post Office board. A public appointment process was under way, but Mr Staunton apparently wanted to bypass it, appointing someone from within the existing board without due process.
He failed to properly consult the Post Office board on the proposal. He failed to hold the required nominations committee. Most importantly, he failed to consult the government as a shareholder which the company was required to do.
I know that honourable members will agree with me is such a cavalier approach to governance was the last thing we needed in the Post Office given its historic failings.
In his Sunday Times interview Staunton addressed this claim, arguing that he was backing the candidate favoured by the board, when the government wanted its own candidate to get the job. (See 4.07pm.)
She said that Staunton was failing to cooperate with an investigation into allegations of bullying against him. She said:
I should also inform the house that, while he was post, a formal investigation was launched into allegations made regarding Mr Staunton’s conduct. This included serious matters such as bullying.
Concerns were brought to my department’s attention about Mr Staunton’s willingness to cooperate with that investigation.
So it is right that the British public knew the facts behind this case, and what was said in the phone call where I dismissed Mr Staunton.
She said she was publishing a readout of her conversation with Staunton. She said:
Today I am depositing a copy of that readout in both libraries of the house so the honourable members and the public can see the truth. Personal information relating to other post office employees in those minutes have been redacted.
She said there was “no evidence whatsoever” to support Staunton’s claim that an official told him to stall compensation payments. She said:
Mr Staunton claimed that when he was first appointed as chair of the Post Office he was told by senior civil servants to stall on paying compensation. There is no evidence whatsoever that this is true.
In fact, on becoming Post Office chair, Mr Staunton received a letter from the BEIS [Deparment of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy] permanent secretary, Sarah Munby, on 9 December 2022. It welcomed him to his role, making it crystal clear that successfully reaching settlements with victims of the Post Office scandal should be one of his highest priorities …
The reality is that my department has done everything it can to speed up compensation payments for victims. We’ve already made payments totaling £160m across all three compensation schemes. That includes our announcement last autumn of the optional £600,000 pound fixed-sum award for those who’ve been wrongfully convicted. It is the strongest refutation of those who would claim that we only acted after the ITV drama.
She said that all 2,417 post office operators who claimed through the original Horizon shortfall scheme have now had offers of compensation. In total, around £1bn has been committed to ensure wronged post office operators can be compensated, she said.
She said Staunton’s claims were a disgrace. She said:
In short we are putting our money where our mouth is and our shoulders to the wheel and ensuring that justice is done. It is not fair on the victims of this scandal, which has already ruined so many lives and livelihoods, to claim, as Mr Staunton has done, that this has been dragged out a second longer than it ought to be.
For Henry Staunton to suggest otherwise, for whatever personal motives, is a disgrace and it risks damaging confidence in the compensation schemes which ministers and civil servants are working so hard to deliver.
I would hope the most people reading the interview in yesterday, Sunday, Sunday Times, we’ll see it for what it was a blatant attempt to seek revenge following dismissal.
And she defended her decision to hit back at him so robustly. She said:
I must say I regret the way in which these events have unfolded. We did everything we could to manage this dismissal in a dignified way for Mr Staunton and others. However, I will not hesitate to defend myself, and more importantly, my officials, who cannot respond directly to these baseless attacks.

Middle East crisis: Knesset votes to back Netanyahu’s opposition to ‘unilateral’ creation of Palestinian state – as it happened,2024-02-21,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/21/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-gaza-palestine-lebanon-un-the-hague,"99 of 120 lawmakers voted to support declaration passed earlier this week by cabinet and say any accord would have to be reached by direct negotiations
Israel’s Knesset has voted to back prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opposition to the “unilateral” creation of Palestinian state.
Reuters reports 99 of 120 lawmakers voted to support the declaration passed earlier this week by the cabinet. Nine people voted against.
The Israeli position also says that any permanent accord with the Palestinians would have to be reached through direct negotiations between the sides, and not by international dictates.
Critics have argued this position effectively gives Israel a unilateral veto on the creation of a Palestinian state, and is one of the reasons little progress has been made towards a two-state solution since the Oslo Accords were signed 30 years ago.
In its case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague this week, the Palestinian delegation cited Netanyahu’s own words in an attempt to demonstrate that Israel is not approaching negotiations in good faith, with the prime minister having promised Israeli’s that “We will forever keep Jerusalem united under Israel’s sovereignty” and a declaration he gave in 2019 in which he said:
I am guided by several principles when it comes to the [Israeli-occupied] West Bank. The first – this is our homeland. The second – we will continue to build and develop it. Third – not one resident or community will be uprooted in a political agreement. Fourth – the Israeli military and security forces will continue to rule the entire territory, up to the Jordan valley.
It is approaching 4.30pm in The Hague, 5/30pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv, and 6.30pm in Damascus. Here are the headlines …
Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reacted to a Knesset vote endorsing his stand against a unilaterally declared Palestinian state by saying “The Knesset came together in an overwhelming majority against the attempt to impose on us the establishment of a Palestinian state, which would not only fail to bring peace but would endanger the state of Israel.”
The US has told the International Court of Justice in The Hague that the Hamas attack on 7 October demonstrated Israel’s “legitimate security needs” in any solution to conflict in the region. The US urged the court not to “find that Israel is legally obligated to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from occupied territory”, but instead “preserve and promote the established framework” for reaching a two-state solution. Russia and France will make oral submissions to the court later on Wednesday.
Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge. Aid group Doctors Without Borders said that two people were killed when a shelter housing staff in the Gaza Strip was struck during an Israeli operation. The IDF said it recovered “weapons including an RPG and AK-47 rifle” and has located dozens of “terror infrastructures, observation posts, weapon storage facilities, and underground targets” during the last 24 hours. One Israeli soldier was announced as being killed.
The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has announced it is pausing deliveries of food aid to northern Gaza. This comes after incidents on 18 and 19 February when WFP says convoys were unable to deliver aid as planned, largely due to a breakdown in civil order. It said a truck was looted and the driver beaten.
The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel says it found evidence of “systematic and intentional” rape and sexual abuse during the Hamas attack on 7 October, and claimed that Hamas chose to use “sadistic sexual crimes” in order to “harm Israel strategically”. Orit Sulitzeanu, CEO of the organisation, said “The report, submitted to decision-makers at the UN, leaves no room for denial or disregard. Silence is no longer an option. We expect international organisations to take a clear stance”.
At least two people have been killed by what has been described by Syria’s media as an Israeli airstrike on Damascus. A residential building was struck in the Kafr Sousa district of the capital. Israel’s military have not commented on the claim.
In London the UK parliament will vote later on an opposition motion calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The exact wording of the motion has sparked a political row among opposition parties.
Iran’s oil Minister Javad Owji has said Israel was behind last week’s attack on Iranian gas pipelines.
An Israeli airstrike on south Lebanon killed a woman and wounded her daughter on Wednesday, state media said.
My colleague Jason Burke has a wrap of today’s news here: UN agency pauses Gaza food aid deliveries after looting and gunfire
Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reacted to a Knesset vote endorsing his stand against a unilaterally declared Palestinian state.
Reuters reports he said “The Knesset came together in an overwhelming majority against the attempt to impose on us the establishment of a Palestinian state, which would not only fail to bring peace but would endanger the state of Israel.
The vote drew condemnation from the Palestinian foreign ministry, which accused Israel of holding the rights of the Palestinian people hostage by forceful occupation of territories where Palestinians seek to establish a state.
“The ministry reaffirms that the State of Palestine’s full membership in the United Nations and its recognition by other nations does not require permission from Netanyahu,” it said in a statement.
The Israeli position says that any permanent accord with the Palestinians must be reached through direct negotiations between the sides and not by international dictates. Critics have argued this effectively gives Israel an unlimited veto against recognising Palestine. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967.
The issue of conflict between Israel and Hamas and the level of casualties in Gaza has loomed large over UK domestic politics in recent days. We have two pieces about that if you are interested.
Libby Brooks, our Scotland correspondent, has written an analysis on how the stakes are high as the Scottish National Party, who are in power in the devolved Scottish government, and the main UK opposition party Labour, who are hoping to form the next UK-wide government within the next 12 months, wrestle over the precise wording of Gaza ceasefire calls.
Harriet Sherwood has written on how Prince William’s statement about Gaza yesterday has prompted speculation about the involvement of the UK Foreign Office, and whether the royal statement was encouraged or even engineered to increase pressure on Israel. You can read that here:
Warning: this block contains graphic description of sexual and gender-based violence
The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel says it found evidence of “systematic and intentional” rape and sexual abuse during the Hamas attack on 7 October, and claimed that Hamas chose to use “sadistic sexual crimes” in order to “harm Israel strategically”.
The report said the sexual and gender-based violence occurred in four main places – the Nova music festival, communities near the Gaza border, Israeli military bases that were overrun by Hamas and places where hostages were held in Gaza.
Orit Sulitzeanu, the CEO of the organisation, said:
The report, submitted to decision-makers at the UN, leaves no room for denial or disregard. The terrorist organization Hamas chose to harm Israel strategically in two clear ways – kidnapping citizens and committing sadistic sexual crimes. Silence is no longer an option. We expect international organizations to take a clear stance.
AP reports that the findings, published Wednesday, did not specify the number of cases it had documented or identify any victims, even anonymously. Sulitzeanu said such determinations were difficult because many of the victims were killed after being assaulted, and first responders were so overwhelmed by the scale of death and destruction that they did not document signs of sexual abuse.
Publishing the report, the organisation said it “does not provide quantitative information due to the nature of the events, most of which resulted in the victims’ deaths, making their full extent unknown and possibly unknowable.”
The report’s authors, Dr. Carmit Klar-Chalamish and Noga Berger, said “The brutal practices used on 7 October, such as genital mutilation of girls, women, and men, shooting, and weapon insertion, were designed to destroy and inflict sadistic terror. The manner in which these assaults were carried out aimed to reinforce their impact on the victims and their communities.”
The Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent, Bethan McKernan, previously reported in January that evidence points to systematic use of rape and sexual violence by Hamas in 7 October attacks. In that piece, she wrote:
By cross-referencing testimonies given to police, published interviews with witnesses, and photo and video footage taken by survivors and first responders, the Guardian is aware of at least six sexual assaults for which multiple corroborating pieces of evidence exist. Two of those victims, who were murdered, were aged under 18.
At least seven women who were killed were also raped in the attack, according to Prof Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, a legal scholar and international women’s rights advocate, from her examination of evidence so far. The New York Times and NBC have both identified more than 30 killed women and girls whose bodies bear signs of abuse, such as bloodied genitals and missing clothes, and according to the Israeli welfare ministry, five women and one man have come forward seeking help for sexual abuse over the past few months.
The report comes a day after Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy described a statement by UN-affiliated experts which asserted there were “credible allegations of egregious human rights violations” of Palestinian women and girls by Israeli security forces including rape and strip-searches as motivated by “hatred of Israel and the Jewish people”.
As I mentioned earlier, lawmakers in London are voting on a motion calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The precise wording – and indeed the parliamentary procedures being used – have become a source of some domestic political controversy in the UK.
While the debate and vote itself are unlikely to have any immediate impact whatsoever on the situation on the ground in Gaza, there may be some longer-term implications for UK policy towards Israel and the Palestinian people. The opposition Labour party is some distance ahead in the polls at the moment, and with a UK general election guaranteed before January 2025, tey are expected to form the next government. That makes their positioning on the issue more significant.
My colleague Andrew Sparrow is live blogging the debate in the House of Commons over here:
UN agencies have reported that the food situation has been worsening in northern Gaza due to restrictions on the amount of humanitarian aid being allowed to enter the Gaza Strip, and the difficulties in distributing aid, caused in part by damage to infrastructure from Israeli bombing, and in part to concerns over civil disorder.
ActionAid spoke to Dr Hossam Abu Safiya, a paediatric consultant in the northern Gaza Strip, who said yesterday that the lack of food and clean water was killing children. He told them:
We have lost a significant number of children in recent days due to widespread malnutrition. We have recorded many cases that have been admitted to the intensive care unit. Most of the cases arrived in a state of advanced dehydration. There is a spread of infection, especially at the level of the digestive system.
The picture was also difficult for new mothers and newborns. Abu Safiya said:
Most cases that give birth, whether at home or in shelter centres, are in a very critical situation. Most of the children’s sizes and weights are small. Unfortunately, there is no proper nutrition for the mother and no proper nutrition for the child. And the lack of supportive milk for children leads to a worsening of children’s health conditions. The health situation is catastrophic in every sense of the word.
Riham Jafari, advocacy and communications coordinator at ActionAid Palestine said it was “beyond heartbreaking” that the hunger crisis was “completely avoidable”, and that “the world can and must do much more to ensure that life-saving food supplies and other humanitarian aid can enter Gaza at scale.”
A protest aimed at the Israeli government has been held in Tel Aviv today by families and supporters of Israelis being held captive by Hamas in Gaza.
Wearing masks depicting some of the people being held by Hamas, and holding up signs saying “Sorry for being kidnapped” the demonstration the day after Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich sparked fury by claiming the hostages were “not the most important thing” in Israel’s war objectives.
Smotrich had criticised those saying the hostages had to be returned “at any price”, saying “‘At any price’ is a problem. We have to return the hostages and we have to put pressure on Hamas. It’s not the most important thing. Why make it a competition? We need to destroy Hamas. That is very important.”
Israel’s opposition leader Yair Lapid responded by saying “Smotrich’s attack on the families of the hostages is a moral disgrace. Heartless people cannot continue to lead the state of Israel into the abyss.”
Israel’s Knesset has voted to back prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opposition to the “unilateral” creation of Palestinian state.
Reuters reports 99 of 120 lawmakers voted to support the declaration passed earlier this week by the cabinet. Nine people voted against.
The Israeli position also says that any permanent accord with the Palestinians would have to be reached through direct negotiations between the sides, and not by international dictates.
Critics have argued this position effectively gives Israel a unilateral veto on the creation of a Palestinian state, and is one of the reasons little progress has been made towards a two-state solution since the Oslo Accords were signed 30 years ago.

Third – not one resident or community will be uprooted in a political agreement. Fourth – the Israeli military and security forces will continue to rule the entire territory, up to the Jordan valley.
Israel’s military has also released details of its attack inside Lebanon.
On the IDF’s official Telegram channel, it said that today:
IDF fighter jets struck three Hezbollah operational command centers in southern Lebanon. Furthermore, this morning, IDF artillery struck in order to remove a threat in the areas of Aalma El Chaeb and Dhayra in southern Lebanon.
The statement also reiterated Israel’s position:
Hezbollah’s military activity south of the Litani River in Lebanon, including the use and storage of armaments, is a clear violation of UN security council resolution 1701. The IDF will continue to defend Israel’s borders from any threat.
Since 7 October Israel and anti-Israeli forces in Lebanon have repeatedly exchanged fire over the UN-drawn blue line that separates the two countries/.
UN security council resolution 1701 was passed in 2006, which among other things, called for:
Israel and Lebanon to support a permanent ceasefire and a longterm solution based on the following principles and elements.
full respect for the blue line by both parties
security arrangements to prevent the resumption of hostilities, including the establishment between the blue line and the Litani river of an area free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the government of Lebanon and of Unifil.
UK prime minister Rishi Sunak has said “calling for an immediate full ceasefire now, which collapses back into fighting in days or weeks, would not be in anyone’s interest”.
Speaking in the Commons, SNP MP Pete Wishart (Perth and North Perthshire) said: “Voting against the Iraq war was the vote that I’m most proud of in my time in this House. Today, after 29,000 deaths in Gaza, we face a vote of similar significance.
“Does the prime minister believe that MPs today should look back with that same pride knowing that they have done everything possible to stop the death, destruction and misery tonight?”
Sunak said: “Nobody wants to see the fighting in Gaza go on for a moment longer than is necessary. Nobody wants to see innocent civilians suffer, and that’s why we’re doing absolutely everything we can to bring about an immediate humanitarian pause, allowing for the safe release of hostages which (Mr Wishart) failed to mention, I believe.
“But also getting more aid into Gaza to create the conditions for a genuinely sustainable ceasefire. That is the position that is shared by our allies, that is what our diplomatic efforts are focused on, and that’s what our motion tonight will reflect.”
Sunak later told the Commons: “Just calling for an immediate full ceasefire now, which collapses back into fighting in days or weeks, would not be in anyone’s interest.”
An Israeli air strike on south Lebanon killed a woman and wounded her daughter on Wednesday, state media said, while a hospital source told AFP a young girl had also died.
Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and Israel have been exchanging near-daily fire across the border since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7.
Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said that Khadija Salman was killed and her daughter seriously wounded in the “enemy” strike on the southern village of Majdal Zun.
Requesting anonymity, a hospital source confirmed the woman had died and her daughter remained in serious condition, adding that a young girl was also killed.
The cross-border exchanges since October have killed at least 271 people on the Lebanese side, most of them Hezbollah fighters but also including 42 civilians, according to an AFP tally. According to the Israeli army, 10 soldiers and six civilians have been killed.
Hezbollah said Wednesday it had carried out several attacks on Israeli troops and positions.
Last week, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah vowed that Israel would pay “with blood” for civilians it killed, after 10 civilians, including seven members of one family, were killed in Lebanon’s largest single-day death toll so far. Five Hezbollah fighters were also killed.
Antony Blinken will meet with president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Wednesday, amid a diplomatic spat after the Brazilian leader likened Israel’s war in Gaza to the Nazi genocide during the Second world war.
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday that Washington disagreed with Lula’s comments, but declined to preview what Blinken would say in the meeting on the issue.
US officials have said they expect Lula and Secretary of State Blinken to have a robust conversation on issues of global security, including the conflict in Gaza sparked by attacks in southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, Reuters reports.
Israel said on Monday that Lula is not welcome in Israel until he takes back the comments.
Lula’s comments came after he visited the Middle East last week and just ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers in Rio de Janeiro as part of Brazil’s presidency of the G20 group of advanced economies.
Here are the latest images coming across the wires from Gaza and elsewhere:
It has just gone 1pm in The Hague, 2pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv, and 3pm in Damascus. Here are the latest headlines …
The US has told the International Court of Justice in The Hague that the Hamas attack on 7 October demonstrated Israel’s “legitimate security needs” in any solution to conflict in the region. The US urged the court not to “find that Israel is legally obligated to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from occupied territory”, but instead “preserve and promote the established framework” for reaching a two-state solution.

At least two people have been killed by what has been described by Syria’s media as an Israeli airstrike on Damascus. A residential building was struck in the Kafr Sousa district of the capital.
In London the UK parliament will vote later on an opposition motion calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The exact wording of the motion has sparked a political row among opposition parties.
Iran’s oil Minister Javad Owji has said Israel was behind last week’s attack on Iranian gas pipelines.
Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy has condemned a UN report which said there were “credible allegations of egregious human rights violations” of Palestinian women and girls by Israeli security forces including rape and strip-searches as motivated by “hatred of Israel and the Jewish people”.
Richard Visek of the US state department has concluded the US oral submission to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
He finished by saying:
As I said at the outset, you have a difficult task before you. Others have asked you to broadly construe the questions on the law. They have asked you to try to resolve the whole of the dispute between the parties through an advisory opinion addressed to questions focusing on the acts of only one party.
The United States disagrees with that, that this approach would be consistent with the court’s role within the United Nations, or the established UN framework for achieving peace through negotiations.
Hamas’s attacks, hostage taking and other atrocities, the ongoing hostilities and the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and the violence in the West Bank reinforce the United States resolve to urgently achieve a final peace that includes the full realisation of Palestinian self-determination. The current crisis illustrates the vital need to achieve this peace. This final peace with a Palestinian state living safely and securely alongside a secure Israel fully integrated into the region.
As Secretary Blinken said, quote, we are not going to have durable security for Israel, unless and until Palestinian political aspirations are met.
The lack of meaningful progress on a negotiated end to the conflict and establishment of peace between the parties and for the region cannot and must not persist. The security council and general assembly continue to make clear their support for the two state solution and the established framework to fulfil it.
This conflict cannot be resolved through violence or unilateral actions.
Negotiations are the path to lasting peace.
For these reasons, we respectfully encourage the court to carefully calibrate its advice in this proceeding to support and promote final realisation of peace and stability within the established UN framework. Set out UN security council resolutions 242 and 338.
The court has finished the morning session, and will reconvene at 2pm GMT when Russia and France will be among the countries giving their oral submission. You will be able to watch proceedings live on the blog.
The US has argued in the International Court of Justice in The Hague that there is no time limit in law for a state to occupy another territory and that it should not order Israel to unilaterally withdraw from the Palestinian territory it has occupied since 1967 without there being commitments from the Palestinian side on Israel’s security.
Richard Visek of the US state department told the panel of judges:
The court should not deviate from longstanding principles of international law, including with respect to the law of belligerent occupation.
International law does not provide for an occupation itself to be rendered unlawful or void, based either on its duration or on any violations of occupation law.
…
With respect to duration, international law does not impose specific time limits on an occupation. That said, belligerent occupation is a temporary measure for administering territory under the control of belligerent armed forces.
A few days ago, at the Munich Security Conference, Secretary Blinken emphasise that it is more urgent than ever to proceed to a Palestinian state, one that also ensures the security of Israel and makes the necessary commitments to do so.
In light of these considerations, the court should not find that Israel is legally obligated to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from occupied territory.
The key argument that the US is making to the International Court of Justice in The Hague is summed up here:
First, and fundamentally, the court should not take up the suggestion of some to interpret the questions in this proceeding as encompassing the entire question of Palestine. The request seeks advice only with respect to the legal consequences of the conduct of one of the parties to the underlying conflict. This one-sidedness, which contrasts with the reciprocity inherent in the established framework, necessarily must inform the courts approach to this advisory proceeding.
Second, contrary to the assertions of some participants, and in calling for the court to take this measured approach to the question referred, the US is by no means suggesting there is no role for the court. Nor is it the position of the US of the court must refrain from considering violations of international law or the legal consequences thereof.
Our argument is grounded in respect for the UN Charter and the roles and responsibilities assigned to the UN’s principal organs. The court’s advisory function was designed to assist the UN’s principal political organs in the proper performance of their respective functions. In exercising its advisory role, the court must necessarily consider the extent to which the security council and general assembly have taken action to address the matter of international peace and security.
Essentially the US is arguing that the court should not offer an advisory opinion because the case before it is one-sided against Israel – the country has declined to take part directly in the proceedings although it has made a written submission – and that the security council and general assembly of the UN have an established framework and the matter is in hand.
Richard Visek of the US state department went on to say:
The challenge for the court is how to provide its advice in a way that promotes the framework rather than disrupting its balance, potentially making the possibility of negotiations even more difficult.
In this regard, it would not, as some participants suggest, be conducive to achievement of the established frameworkto issue an opinion that calls for a unilateral immediate and unconditional withdrawal by Israel. That does not take account for Israel’s legitimate security needs.
…
We were all reminded of those security needs on 7 October, and they persist. Regrettably, those needs have been ignored by many of the participants in asserting how the court should consider the questions before it.

"Middle East crisis: Israel seeking ‘right people’ to run Gaza after Hamas, say sources – as it happened",2024-02-22,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/22/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-gaza-latest-news-updates,"Senior official tells Reuters that Israel is seeking people not affiliated with Hamas to manage civilian affairs in areas of the Gaza Strip
Israel is seeking Palestinians who are not affiliated with Hamas to manage civilian affairs in areas of the Gaza Strip designed as testing grounds for postwar administration of the enclave, a senior Israeli official said on Thursday, according to Reuters.
But Hamas said the plan, which the Israeli official said would also exclude anybody on the payroll of the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority, would amount to an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza and was doomed to failure.
Reuters reports that the Israeli official said the planned “humanitarian pockets” would be in districts of the Gaza Strip from which Hamas has been expelled, but that their ultimate success would hinge on Israel achieving its goal of destroying the Islamist faction across the tiny coastal territory that it has been governing.
“We’re looking for the right people to step up to the plate,” the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. “But it is clear that this will take time, as no one will come forward if they think Hamas will put a bullet in their head.”
The plan, the official added, “may be achieved once Hamas is destroyed and doesn’t pose a threat to Israel or to Gazans”.
Israel’s Channel 12 TV reported that the Zeitoun neighbourhood of northern Gaza City was a candidate for implementation of the plan, under which local merchants and civil society leaders would distribute humanitarian aid.
The Israeli military would provide peripheral security in Zeitoun, Channel 12 said, describing renewed troop incursions there this week as designed to root out remnants of a Hamas garrison that was hit hard in the early stages of the war.
Reuters said there was no official confirmation of the Channel 12 report.
It is 6pm in Rafah, Tel Aviv and Beirut, and 7.30pm in Tehran. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Middle East coverage here.
Here is a recap of the latest developments:
Israel is seeking Palestinians who are not affiliated with Hamas to manage civilian affairs in planned “humanitarian pockets” of the Gaza Strip, designed as testing grounds for postwar administration of the enclave, a senior Israeli official said on Thursday, according to Reuters. But Hamas said the plan, which the Israeli official said would also exclude anybody on the payroll of the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority, would amount to an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza and was doomed to failure.
UN secretary general, António Guterres said that in north Gaza, one in six children under 2-years-old is acutely malnourished as he called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire”. He linked to a news release on the World Food Programme website which highlighted the scarcity of food and safe water. It also said: “diseases are rife, compromising women and children’s nutrition and immunity and resulting in a surge of acute malnutrition.”
In addition, they called for the UN agency assisting Palestine refugees (UNRWA) “to receive the resources it needs to provide life-saving assistance” and “a halt to campaigns seeking to discredit the UN and non-governmental organisations doing their best to save lives”.
In a collective appeal, heads of UN humanitarian entities and global NGOs have implored world leaders to help prevent further deterioration of the crisis in Gaza. The principals of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), the coordinating body of global humanitarian organisations, released a statement on Wednesday in which it said “civilians in Gaza are in extreme peril while the world watches on”. It listed ten requirements “to avoid an even worse catastrophe”.
Israeli strikes in Gaza kill 48 as fears mount over humanitarian crisis. Seven Israeli strikes hit Rafah early on Thursday, one of them flattening a large mosque and devastating much of the surrounding block. Another strike hit a residential home in Rafah sheltering the al-Shaer family, killing at least four people, including a mother and her child. Strikes in central Gaza overnight killed 44 people, including 14 children and 8 women, according to hospital officials there.
A UN attempt to deliver 10 convoys of food aid to northern Gaza over seven days was suspended earlier this week after trucks were looted by crowds, a driver was beaten and gunfire reported amid chaotic scenes. “In most cases, when food does get taken directly from convoys, it’s because of utter desperation, with people even eating it on the spot,” said Jonathan Fowler, a spokesperson for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).
An Israeli man in his 20s was killed in Thursday’s shooting at a checkpoint on a West Bank highway where gunmen opened fire on cars in the morning rush-hour traffic jam. AP report that five others were injured, including a pregnant woman – some other news agencies have put the number of injured at eight. Security forces killed two of the gunmen and detained the third, police said.
Tensions are rising in the West Bank ahead of Ramadan, which in the past has seen increased clashes, often in connection to restrictions imposed on Palestinian worshippers going to al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City during the holy month.
The foreign ministers of 26 European countries on Thursday called for a pause in fighting leading to a longer ceasefire. They urged Israel not to take military action in Rafah “that would worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian situation.”
Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz has said there are “promising early signs of progress” on a new deal to release hostages from Gaza amid regional talks to secure a pause in the war. His comments came as US media reported that CIA chief William Burns was expected in Paris for hostage talks.
Yemen’s Houthis said they had banned Israeli-linked and US and UK-flagged vessels from the Red Sea. Ships that are wholly or partially owned by Israeli individuals or entities and Israel-flagged vessels are banned from the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea, said statements from an agency controlled by Yemen’s Houthi group seen by Reuters on Thursday.
Israel intercepted what appeared to be an attack launched by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Thursday near the port city of Eilat, authorities said.
Two missiles were fired at a vessel in an attack south-east of the Yemeni port city of Aden on Thursday, causing a fire onboard, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency said on Thursday. US-led coalition forces are responding to the incident, which took place 70 nautical miles from Aden in the direction of the Red Sea, the UKMTO agency said without elaborating.
The French navy has shot down two drones over the Red Sea where Yemen’s Houthi rebels have been attacking ships, the defence ministry said on Thursday, in the second such incident this week.
Security firm Ambrey also reported a fire aboard a Palau-flagged, British-owned general cargo ship after two missile strikes south-east of Yemen’s Aden. “Merchant shipping is advised to stay clear of the vessel and proceed with caution,” it added.
Japan has had strong words for Israel in the opening of its oral submission at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which is hearing further argument today in the case “legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the cccupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.” Japan’s legal team said “No country must be allowed to be above the law” and argued that “Israel is acting and has been allowed to act in complete disregard of international law”.
At least 29,410 Palestinians have been killed and 69,465 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.
Dozens of lawmakers stormed out of the UK’s parliament on Wednesday with tempers flaring as the three biggest political parties sought to outmanoeuvre each other over a vote on a ceasefire in Gaza. The uproar followed a decision by the speaker to ignore precedent and allow a vote which helped the opposition Labour party avoid a large-scale rebellion among its own lawmakers over its position on the Israel-Hamas war.
The US has urged the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague not to issue a ruling calling for Israel’s immediate withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories, arguing that Israeli security had to be taken into account in any solution to the conflict.
UNRWA has no “plan B” past March should donor countries that withheld funding after Israeli allegations uphold their suspensions, the head of its Lebanon office said on Thursday. Sixteen countries suspended funding pending an investigation by the UN’s oversight office that Lebanon chief Dorothee Klaus said would be ready in a few weeks.
An Israeli bombing of an United Nations relief and works agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) building housing displaced people in the Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip has resulted in casualties, according to Al Jazeera. The Qatar-based broadcaster said an Israeli raid was targeting a Palestinian vehicle east of the camp at the time. Footage of the incident, verified by Al Jazeera, indicated the death of at least one person as well as the injuries of several others.
A Palestinian man being treated at a Gaza hospital for severe bruising on his face, cuts on his fingers and other injuries said Israeli soldiers beat him with chunks of masonry and chairs after bursting into his home on 20 February, reports Reuters. The account by Ramadan Shamlakh, 22, which Reuters could not verify from another source, was the latest in a series of allegations of mistreatment of Palestinians by Israeli forces since the start of their war against Hamas. The Israeli army says it treats detainees in accordance with international law.
The UK has worked with Jordan to drop aid to a hospital in northern Gaza. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the UK-funded consignment was delivered by the Jordanian air force to the Tal Al-Hawa hospital on Wednesday. The hospital, set up by the Jordanian air force, is located in Gaza City.
Oxfam’s head of policy and advocacy, Katy Chakrabortty said the “playground politics” in the UK parliament vote on an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel was a “disgrace”. Responding to Wednesday night’s events in parliament, Chakrabortty said: “It is a disgrace that there has been so much playground politics in parliament this evening, while so many lives are at stake.”
Israeli media reported that there were clashes between security forces and Israeli protesters at the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Demonstrators have repeatedly gathered there attempting to blockade humanitarian aid entering Gaza, arguing that the hostages held by Hamas should be released in return for the aid.
An Australian logistics expert who is working at a hospital in Rafah has warned that “everyone here is struggling” while raising fears of a “catastrophic” Israeli ground offensive in the southern Gaza city. Lindsay Croghan, who is on assignment with Médecins Sans Frontières, also said there must be an “immediate and unconditional ceasefire” because a prolonged debate “equates to more deaths”.
The White House special envoy Brett McGurk will meet Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi in Israel on Thursday afternoon to discuss potential hostage talks and Netanyahu’s proposed Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operation in Rafah, according to The Times of Israel.
Seven Israeli strikes hit Rafah early on Thursday, one of them flattening a large mosque and devastating much of the surrounding block, reports AP.
Footage from the scene showed al-Farouq Mosque pancaked to the ground, with its concrete domes tumbled around it and nearby buildings shattered.Another strike hit a residential home in Rafah sheltering the al-Shaer family, killing at least four people, including a mother and her child.Strikes in central Gaza overnight killed 44 people, including 14 children and 8 women, according to hospital officials there.
Elsewhere, Thursday’s shooting at a checkpoint on a West Bank highway where gunmen opened fire on cars in the morning rush-hour traffic jam killed an Israeli man in his 20s. AP report that five others were injured, including a pregnant woman. Security forces killed two of the gunmen and detained the third, police said.Hamas in a statement Thursday praised the attack in Jerusalem and said it was a “natural response” to Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza and raids in the West Bank, and called for more attacks until they can achieve a “fully sovereign” Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. The militant group did not claim responsibility for the attack.Tensions are rising in the West Bank ahead of Ramadan, which in the past has seen increased clashes, often in connection to restrictions imposed on Palestinian worshippers going to al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City during the holy month.
Also, heads of 13 UN agencies and five other aid groups issued a joint plea for a ceasefire late on Wednesday, warning that an attack on Rafah will bring “mass casualties” and could “deal a death blow” to the humanitarian operation bringing aid to Palestinians, which “is already on its knees.” Earlier this week, the World Food Program had to halt food deliveries to northern Gaza because of increasing chaos.The foreign ministers of 26 European countries on Thursday called for a pause in fighting leading to a longer ceasefire. They urged Israel not to take military action in Rafah “that would worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian situation.”
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has no “plan B” past March should donor countries that withheld funding after Israeli allegations uphold their suspensions, the head of its Lebanon office said on Thursday, reports Reuters.
Israel accused 12 of UNRWA’s 13,000 employees in the Gaza Strip of taking part in the Hamas-led assault on Israel last year. The claims came after years of Israeli calls for the agency to be disbanded, and as Palestinians face widespread hunger and only a trickle of aid into the bombarded strip.
Sixteen countries suspended funding pending an investigation by the UN’s oversight office that Lebanon chief Dorothee Klaus said would be ready in a few weeks.
“We hope that as many donors as possible indicate to the agency that they are reconsidering the funding freeze, and that funding will be restored to the agency, hopefully in such a way that we don’t have a cashflow issue, and services continue uninterrupted,” she said. “We do not have a plan B.”
Already, her office may not be able to finance its quarterly cash distribution to 65% of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. “This will be the first indicator to the community that UNRWA is cash-strapped, and this would be the first service that we will not be able to provide in quarter one,” Klaus said.
While UNRWA has faced cash crunches before, the collective suspension has prompted an unprecedented crisis and it would be wrong to think other agencies could fill the gap, she said.
In Lebanon, UNRWA manages 12 camps for refugees, providing services from healthcare and schooling to garbage collection. If funding dries up, within a couple of days there would be trash filling camp streets, Klaus said.
Israel’s allegations have also prompted a separate review process by UNRWA that she said would examine safeguards protecting its neutrality and independence.
Asked if that would involve an examination of possible affiliations to armed groups of UNRWA staff in Lebanon’s camps, Klaus said she expected her branch would be consulted.
The French navy has shot down two drones over the Red Sea where Yemen’s Houthi rebels have been attacking ships, the defence ministry said on Thursday, in the second such incident this week, reports AFP.
The navy, which has two frigates deployed in the area, detected a threat in the night of Wednesday to Thursday and “destroyed two drones”, it said. It said earlier this week it had downed two other drones overnight Monday to Tuesday.
On Monday, the EU formally launched a naval mission to protect Red Sea shipping from the Iran-backed Houthis who control much of war-torn Yemen.
The rebels have been harassing the vital shipping lane since November in a campaign they say is in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war.
France’s Languedoc previously shot down two drones in the Red Sea in self-defence in December, the foreign ministry has said.
The EU aims to have its mission – called Aspides, Greek for “shield” – up and running in a “few weeks” with at least four vessels, an official said last Friday.
The US is spearheading its own naval coalition in the area and has conducted retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, as has the UK.
The dozens of Houthi attacks have roiled shipping in the Red Sea, leading some companies to take alternative routes including a two-week detour around southern Africa.
An Israeli bombing of an United Nations relief and works agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) building housing displaced people in the Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip has resulted in casualties, according to Al Jazeera.
The Qatar-based broadcaster said an Israeli raid was targeting a Palestinian vehicle east of the camp at the time. Footage of the incident, verified by Al Jazeera, indicated the death of at least one person as well as the injuries of several others.
“An Israeli reconnaissance plane bombed the car, and we found martyrs and wounded in the street,” one witness told Al Jazeera.
Earlier today, UNRWA posted on its X account that more than 300 attacks had impacted 153 of its installations.
As military operations continue throughout 📍#GazaStrip, no place is safeOver 300 attacks have impacted 153 @UNRWA installations.Basic infrastructure has been decimated. Food production has come to a halt. Hospitals have turned into battlefields.A ceasefire is long overdue.
A Palestinian man being treated at a Gaza hospital for severe bruising on his face, cuts on his fingers and other injuries said Israeli soldiers beat him with chunks of masonry and chairs after bursting into his home on 20 February, reports Reuters.
The account by Ramadan Shamlakh, 22, which Reuters could not verify from another source, was the latest in a series of allegations of mistreatment of Palestinians by Israeli forces since the start of their war against Hamas. The Israeli army says it treats detainees in accordance with international law.
Filmed for Reuters by a freelance video journalist at Shuhada Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, on Tuesday and Wednesday, Shamlakh had a bloodstained bandage wrapped around his head and another around his left arm. His face was swollen and bloodied, and he could not open his right eye. He walked with a limp. He had a series of cuts on the back of the fingers of his right hand, which he said were made with a knife.
“He would lie me down on the ground and tell me not to move. He would get rocks, the broken ones from our balcony, and throw them at my legs,” Shamlakh said, describing his treatment by one of the soldiers.
“Whenever I would move, I would find his boot, kicking me here, kicking me there. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t speak,” he said, adding that the soldier had also smashed up two chairs over him.
Reuters provided Shamlakh’s name, the name of the area where he lived and the date of the alleged beating to an Israeli army spokesperson, who said the army was unaware of the incident. The spokesperson asked for coordinates, which Reuters did not have.
Israeli media reports that there have been clashes between security forces and Israeli protesters at the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Demonstrators have repeatedly gathered there attempting to blockade humanitarian aid entering Gaza, arguing that the hostages held by Hamas should be released in return for the aid.
Ships that are wholly or partially owned by Israeli individuals or entities and Israel-flagged vessels are banned from the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea, said statements from an agency controlled by Yemen’s Houthi group seen by Reuters on Thursday.
The statements, sent to shipping insurers and firms from the Houthi’s humanitarian operations coordination centre, also said ships owned by US or British individuals or entities, or sailing under their flags, are also banned.
The Houthis have staged a series of attacks on commercial shipping in the region since the 7 October Hamas attack inside Israel. They claim the attacks are in support of the Palestinian cause.
Japan has had strong words for Israel in the opening of its oral submission at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which is hearing further argument today in the case “legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the cccupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.”
Japan’s legal team said “No country must be allowed to be above the law” and argued that “Israel is acting and has been allowed to act in complete disregard of international law”.
Japan described the occupation of Palestinian territory as “unlawful” and “inhumane”.
According to The Times of Israel, the White House special envoy Brett McGurk will meet Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi in Israel this afternoon to discuss potential hostage talks and Netanyahu’s proposed Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operation in Rafah.
The publication said that later this evening, the war cabinet would meet, followed by the full national security cabinet.
Israel is seeking Palestinians who are not affiliated with Hamas to manage civilian affairs in areas of the Gaza Strip designed as testing grounds for postwar administration of the enclave, a senior Israeli official said on Thursday, according to Reuters.
But Hamas said the plan, which the Israeli official said would also exclude anybody on the payroll of the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority, would amount to an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza and was doomed to failure.

Reuters said there was no official confirmation of the Channel 12 report.
The World Food Programme says territory is ‘hanging by a thread’ as food supplies run out and efforts to deliver aid are derailed. Jason Burke reports:
New fighting and a deepening breakdown in public order in northern Gaza have derailed a humanitarian effort to avert a famine in parts of the battered territory, with senior aid officials describing an “incredible level of desperation” as food supplies run out.
A UN attempt to deliver 10 convoys of food aid to northern Gaza over seven days was suspended earlier this week after trucks were looted by crowds, a driver was beaten and gunfire reported amid chaotic scenes.
Reports of fresh clashes between Israeli troops and Hamas militants in northern Gaza have reinforced fears that fighting may continue across the territory for many months if there is no ceasefire, further complicating relief efforts.
The looting incidents were the latest in a series of such attacks, which began around a month ago. Some have involved organised and armed gangs, but most appear spontaneous.
“In most cases, when food does get taken directly from convoys, it’s because of utter desperation, with people even eating it on the spot,” said Jonathan Fowler, a spokesperson for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).
UN secretary general, António Guterres said that in north Gaza, one in six children under 2-years-old is acutely malnourished as he called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire”. It is, he says, “the only way to scale up delivery of aid to those who need it most”.

In a post on X, he linked to a news release on the World Food Programme website. The news release reported, according to a comprehensive new analysis released by the Global Nutrition Cluster, that a “steep rise in malnutrition among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women in the Gaza Strip poses grave threats to their health”.
It also highlights the scarcity of food and safe water. It adds: “diseases are rife, compromising women and children’s nutrition and immunity and resulting in a surge of acute malnutrition.”
Here are some of the latest images on the newswires today:
At least 29,410 Palestinians have been killed and 69,465 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Thursday.
The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.
The US has urged the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague not to issue a ruling calling for Israel’s immediate withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories, arguing that Israeli security had to be taken into account in any solution to the conflict.
“Any movement towards Israel’s withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza requires consideration for Israel’s very real security needs,” Richard Visek, the state department’s acting legal adviser, told the ICJ judges.
Visek was stating the US position in ICJ hearings this week first requested by the UN general assembly in 2022. They are intended to establish the legal status of the occupied territories, and the implications for the international community’s approach to the conflict.
More than 50 states are due to present their stances in the week-long hearings, which have further emphasised the isolation of Israel’s few supporters, following a UN security council hearing on Tuesday in which the US was the lone vote against a draft ceasefire resolution, with the UK abstaining. The US and UK are expected to be virtually alone again at the ICJ hearings in urging restraint in its ruling on Israel’s occupation.
Security firm Ambrey has also reported a fire aboard a Palau-flagged, British-owned general cargo ship after two missile strikes south-east of Yemen’s Aden, reports AFP.
The ship “appeared to be headed from Map Ta Phut, Thailand, and headed in the direction of the Red Sea”, Ambrey said. “Merchant shipping is advised to stay clear of the vessel and proceed with caution,” it added.
There was no immediate claim for the attack but it follows a series of strikes on commercial vessels by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels.
The strikes have prompted some shipping companies to detour around southern Africa to avoid the Red Sea, which normally carries about 12% of global maritime trade.
The UN Conference on Trade and Development warned late last month that the volume of commercial traffic passing through the Suez Canal had fallen more than 40% in the previous two months.
In an update to the news that eight people had been injured in a gun attack in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Thursday, AP are now reporting that one Israeli was also killed in the shooting.
Police said that three gunmen opened fire on Thursday morning on the road near a checkpoint in a “terror attack”. Two of the attackers were killed and a third was found later and detained.
The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency have shared more details on the incident, which took place 70 nautical miles from Aden, that we reported on earlier.
According to Reuters, two missiles were fired at a vessel in an attack south-east of the Yemeni port city of Aden on Thursday, causing a fire onboard, Britain’s maritime agency said.
US-led coalition forces are responding to the incident, which took place 70 nautical miles from Aden in the direction of the Red Sea, the UKMTO agency said without elaborating. “It has been reported that a vessel was attacked by two missiles, resulting in a fire on board,” the UKMTO said.

Welcome to the eighth edition of The Crunch!
In this week’s newsletter we have extreme heat in Australia, beautiful maps of reforestation in the United States, analysis of celebrities singing the US national anthem, how the polls are tracking in the UK and more.
In Australia, patients who are bulk billed do not pay anything for their consultation with a doctor. Doctors bill the government directly through Medicare instead.
Today we have published an analysis of a government health services directory that shows Australia has lost at least 410 GP clinics that fully bulk bill. There has been an increase in the number of clinics that described their billing as “fees apply”.
Guardian Australia’s analysis also shows the change in billing practices aggregated to electorates to give a general overview of where dedicated bulk-billing services are most scarce.
1. Is it hot right now? Yes! Well ...
Western Australia claimed the top 15 hottest places in the world over a 24-hour stretch on Monday. Much of Australia has been hit by bouts of extreme weather in recent months. Is it hot right now? is one of our favourite resources to put these events in context – using Bureau of Meteorology data to show you where today’s temperatures sit in both the recent past and the historical distribution.
2. Yet more evidence that trees are good, actually. More trees please
Like the rest of the world, the US as a whole has been warming since the Industrial Revolution. But temperatures in parts of the south-east have remained flat or even cooled – a “warming hole” that has puzzled scientists. Our Guardian colleagues in America have produced these beautiful maps to illustrate a new study that finds reforestation since the 1920s at least partially explains what’s going on.

"Middle East crisis: Israeli government blocking ‘lifesaving aid’, Human Rights Watch says; Palestinian Authority PM resigns – as it happened",2024-02-26,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/26/middle-east-crisis-live-gaza-israel-netanyahu-ceasefire-deal-hamas-rafah,"Human rights body says Israel not following ICJ order on Gaza aid provision; Mohammad Shtayyeh submits resignation to President Mahmoud Abbas
The Israeli government has failed to comply with an order by the UN’s top court to provide urgently needed aid to desperate people in the Gaza Strip, Human Rights Watch has said.
In its ruling last month, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to follow six provisional measures, including taking “immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip”.
Human Rights Watch said Israel was not adhering to the court’s order on aid provision, citing a 30% drop in the daily average number of aid trucks entering Gaza in the weeks following the court’s ruling.
It said Israel was not adequately facilitating fuel deliveries to hard-hit northern Gaza and blamed Israel for blocking aid from reaching the north, where the World Food Program said last week it was forced to suspend aid deliveries because of increasing chaos in the isolated part of the territory.
Israel is not complying w @CIJ_ICJ binding order in genocide case—starving Gaza's 2.3 million ppl more harshly than before—@hrw finds. Its disregard for the World Court is a challenge to rules-based int’l order. Time for sanctions to press Israel to comply https://t.co/DwF4QVRXfQ pic.twitter.com/z16lzFaOu6
“The Israeli government is starving Gaza’s 2.3 million Palestinians, putting them in even more peril than before the World Court’s binding order,” Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch, said.
“The Israeli government has simply ignored the court’s ruling, and in some ways even intensified its repression, including further blocking lifesaving aid.”
Israel denies it is restricting the entry of aid and has instead blamed humanitarian organisations operating inside Gaza, saying hundreds of trucks filled with aid sit idle on the Palestinian side of the main crossing. The UN says it can’t always reach the trucks at the crossing because it is at times too dangerous.Benjamin Netanyahu’s office also said on Monday the war cabinet had approved a plan to deliver humanitarian aid safely into Gaza in a way that would “prevent the cases of looting”. It did not disclose further details.
An active member of the US air force has died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington over the weekend in protest of Israel’s war in Gaza, the Agence France-Presse news agency quoted the Pentagon as saying.
Israeli officials headed on Monday to Qatar, where Hamas has its political office, to work on terms of a Gaza truce and hostage release deal, a source told Reuters. The source said the Israeli working delegation, made up of staff from the military and the Mossad spy agency, was tasked with creating an operational centre to support negotiations.
Israel mounted airstrikes west of the Lebanese city of Baalbek on Monday, killing at least two Hezbollah members, sources in Lebanon told Reuters. The Israeli military said it was striking Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon but provided no further details. Hezbollah said earlier on Monday it had shot down an Israeli Hermes 450 drone over Lebanese territory using a surface-to-air missile, the second time it has announced a downing of this type of unmanned aerial vehicle.
Israel’s military “presented the war cabinet with a plan for evacuating the population from areas of fighting in the Gaza Strip, and with the upcoming operational plan,” a statement from Benjamin Netayahu’s office said. Israel has threatened to launch a full-blown attack on Rafah, the last city at Gaza’s southern edge, despite international pleas - including from its main ally Washington - for restraint. Netanyahu, who has promised “total victory”, said an operation is necessary to root out four battalions of Hamas fighters based there.

At least 29,782 Palestinians have been killed and 70,043 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said. In the past 24 hours, 90 Palestinians were killed and 164 injured in Israeli strikes, the ministry said.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has criticised the UN security council for failing to adequately respond to Israel’s war in Gaza and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which he said had “perhaps fatally” undermined its authority. He also said that a full-scale Israeli assault in Rafah would have devastating consequences. “An all-out Israeli offensive on the city would not only be terrifying for more than a million Palestinian civilians sheltering there, it would put the final nail in the coffin of our aid programmes,” the UN chief said in a speech.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, told a press conference that he submitted his resignation to President Mahmoud Abbas. Shtayyeh, an academic economist who took office in 2019, said he was resigning to allow for the formation of a broad consensus among Palestinians about political arrangements following Israel’s war in Gaza.
Israeli forces killed more than 30 Palestinian gunmen in Gaza City’s Zeitoun district, more than 10 in the central Gaza Strip and others in the southern city of Khan Younis, the military said on Monday in a summary of the last 24 hours’ operations.
The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and the Federation of Arab Journalists are marking 26 February as the International Day in support of Palestinian Journalists.
In a press release, the IFJ said:
One hundred journalists were killed in four months, the equivalent of seven per week. This massacre is a terrible and unjustified tragedy.
The needs of our colleagues working in Gaza have become critical. In the middle of winter, our sisters and brothers and their families lack everything and especially the essentials: clothes, blankets, tents, food, water... The scarcity of these basic necessities in this small territory of 40km long and 5km wide, that is subject to a blockade, results in a surge in prices. Basic goods, where they are available, are no longer affordable.
The IFJ is also alarmed by the poor international coverage of the conflict, resulting from the world media’s exclusion from the enclave by Israel. All over the world we deserve to know what is going on in Gaza. This deliberate denial of the right to report is an abuse of media freedom.
The Committee to Protect Journalists, Human Rights Watch, Freedom House and other groups said in a letter to the US president, Joe Biden, in January that more media workers have been killed in the conflict since the Hamas attack on 7 October than in any single country over an entire year.
The letter urged Biden to “abjure the indiscriminate and deliberate killing of journalists, promptly and thoroughly investigate all attacks on journalists, and hold accountable individuals found to be responsible for them”.
The Committee to Protect Journalists has accused the Israeli military of targeting journalists and their families in Gaza. Israel denies that it targets journalists, saying it only targets Hamas.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said it has successfully evacuated 24 people from al-Amal Hospital, including 18 patients and injured people, eight of whom needed urgent surgery.
The PRCS also said in its post on X that logistical supplies, food, and water were delivered to the hospital, located in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.
The PRCS wrote:
Despite pre-coordination by the United Nations convoy team and their escort, the occupation obstructed the convoy’s passage for approximately 7 hours at the military checkpoint west of the al-Amal neighbourhood. 
All medics were forced out of their vehicles and made to sit on the ground, while three of them were detained and taken to an unknown location after being stripped of their clothes. 
The occupation released one of them after midnight, while the detention of medics Jihad Aslim and Ramadan Ashour has continued since yesterday evening.
An active member of the US air force has died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington over the weekend in protest of Israel’s war in Gaza, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency quotes the Pentagon as saying (see earlier post at 07.43 for more details).
Emergency responders rushed to the scene just before 1pm EST (6pm GMT) on Sunday in response to a “call for person on fire outside the Israeli embassy,” according the Washington DC fire department. They arrived to find that US secret service officers had already extinguished the fire.
The man had filmed himself shouting “Free Palestine” as he lit himself on fire, according to footage shared on social media. He was initially transported to hospital with “critical life-threatening injuries,” the fire department said.
On Monday, a US air force spokesperson told AFP the “individual involved in yesterday’s incident succumbed to his injuries and passed away last night”. She said: “We will provide additional details 24 hours after next-of-kin notifications are complete.”
A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy said no staff were injured in the incident, and that the man was “unknown” to them.
After surviving on bitter loaves made from animal feed instead of proper flour, three young brothers who fled their home in Gaza City for a tent further south were tucking into a tub of halawa, a sweet crumbly paste, when they spoke to journalists from the Reuters news agency.
Seraj Shehada, aged eight, and his brothers Ismail, nine, and Saad, 11, said they had run away in secret to take refuge with their aunt in her tent in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, because there was nothing to eat in Gaza City. Seraj Shehada said:
When we were in Gaza City, we used to eat nothing. We would eat every two days.
Referring to loaves made from grains and seeds meant for animal consumption, he said:
We would eat bird and donkey food, just anything. Day after day, not this food.
Food shortages have been a significant problem across the Palestinian enclave since the start of the war, but are particularly acute in northern Gaza, where aid deliveries have been rarer for longer.
Israeli officials headed on Monday to Qatar, where Hamas has its political office, to work on terms of a Gaza truce and hostage release deal, a source told Reuters.
Israel is under pressure from its main ally, the US, to agree a truce soon, to head off a threatened Israeli assault on Rafah, the last city at Gaza Strip’s southern edge where over half the enclave’s 2.3 million people are sheltering.
The source said the Israeli working delegation, made up of staff from the military and the Mossad spy agency, was tasked with creating an operational centre to support negotiations.
Its mission would include vetting proposed Palestinian militants that Hamas wants freed as part of a hostage release deal.
But Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip and triggered the current war by attacking southern Israel on 7 October, says it will not free more than 100 hostages it is still holding unless Israel promises to withdraw from Gaza and end the conflict.
Israel, on the other hand, says it will negotiate only a temporary pause in hostilities to free hostages, will not fully halt the war until Hamas is eradicated, and wants overall security control for Gaza indefinitely.
Israel mounted airstrikes west of the Lebanese city of Baalbek on Monday, killing at least two Hezbollah members, sources in Lebanon told Reuters.

The League of Arab States has called Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories an “affront to international justice,” saying failure to end it amounted to “genocide”.
The International Court of Justice entered its last day of week-long hearings after a request from the UN, with an unprecedented 52 countries giving their views on Israel’s occupation.
“This prolonged occupation is an affront to international justice,” the 22 Arab-country bloc’s representative told judges in The Hague.
“The failure to bring it to an end has led to the current horrors perpetrated against the Palestinian people, amounting to genocide,” Abdel Hakim El-Rifai said.
Israel mounted airstrikes west of the Lebanese city of Baalbek on Monday, killing at least two Hezbollah members, sources in Lebanon told Reuters.
The Israeli military said it was striking Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon but provided no further details. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group.
The strikes hit an area some 18 km (11 miles) from the city of Baalbek, which is known for its ancient ruins, a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Part of the Bekaa Valley region bordering Syria, the area is a political stronghold of the Shi’ite group Hezbollah. The sources said Israel had carried out two simultaneous strikes.Hezbollah has been waging attacks on Israeli positions at the Lebanese-Israeli frontier since the 7 October attack on Israel by its Palestinian ally Hamas, in what it has described as a campaign to support Palestinians under fire from Israeli bombardment in the Gaza Strip.
Hezbollah said earlier on Monday it had shot down an Israeli Hermes 450 drone over Lebanese territory using a surface-to-air missile, the second time it has announced a downing of this type of unmanned aerial vehicle (see earlier post at 09.09)

Israel has threatened to launch a full-blown attack on Rafah, the last city at Gaza’s southern edge, despite international pleas - including from its main ally Washington - for restraint.
People who have fled to Rafah, where an estimated 1.5 million displaced Palestinians have sought shelter, from elsewhere say there is nowhere left to go.
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said earlier this month that the Israel Defense Forces were planning operations in Rafah targeting Hamas fighters, command centres and tunnels, though gave no timeline for the campaign.

Turkey’s deputy foreign minister, Ahmet Yildiz, told judges at the International Court of Justice on Monday that Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories is the root cause of conflict in the region.
“The unfolding situation after October 7 proves once again that, without addressing the root cause of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there can be no peace in the region,” he was quoted by Reuters as saying on the sixth day of hearings.
“The real obstacle to peace is obvious. The deepening occupation by Israel of the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, and failure to implement the two-state vision,” he added.
The UN’s top court is hearing arguments from more than 50 states following a request by the UN general assembly in 2022 to issue a non-binding opinion on the legal consequences of the Israeli occupation.

Joe Biden hopeful of Gaza ceasefire by Monday as details of proposal emerge,2024-02-27,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/26/israel-gaza-ceasefire-biden,"US president appears upbeat as Hamas reportedly mulls 40-day halt in fighting with Palestinian prisoners swapped for Israeli hostages
Joe Biden has said he believes a new, temporary ceasefire in Gaza is possible by next Monday, as Hamas was reportedly considering a draft agreement for a 40-day pause in fighting and the exchange of dozens of Israeli hostages for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, according to a Reuters source.
“My national security adviser tells me that we’re close. We’re close. We’re not done yet,” Biden told reporters during a visit to New York on Monday after taping an appearance on NBC’s Late Night with Seth Meyers. “My hope is by next Monday, we’ll have a ceasefire.”
During the Meyers interview, Biden also said Israel would be willing to temporarily halt its war during the upcoming Muslim fasting month of Ramadan if a deal is reached to release some of the hostages. “Ramadan’s coming up and there has been an agreement by the Israelis that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan as well, in order to give us time to get all the hostages out,” Biden said.
His appearance came hours before details of a draft proposal from truce talks in Paris were reported by Reuters, citing a senior source close to the discussions. The plans reportedly included a 40-day pause in all military operations as well as the exchange of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages at a ratio of 10 to one.
Under the ceasefire terms, hospitals and bakeries in Gaza would be repaired, 500 aid trucks would enter into the strip each day and thousands of tents and caravans would be delivered to house the displaced, the Reuters source said.
The draft also reportedly stated Hamas would free 40 Israeli hostages including women, children under 19, people over 50 and the sick, while Israel would release about 400 Palestinian prisoners and would not re-arrest them, the source said.
It would also reportedly allow the gradual return of displaced civilians to northern Gaza, except men of military age.
Over the weekend, Israel’s war cabinet approved the broad terms of a deal to pause fighting for several weeks in exchange for the release of hostages held in Gaza. In a protracted bid to bring about a truce – Egypt, Qatar, the United States, France and others have acted as go-betweens for Israel and Hamas, with negotiations ongoing.
A deal could include the release of several hundred Palestinian detainees held by Israel, media reports suggest, according to Agence France-Presse.
Qatar’s Emir sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani – whose country hosts Hamas leaders and helped broker a one-week truce in November – is due in Paris this week, according to the French presidency.
A weeks-long pause would allow hundreds of trucks to deliver aid to Gaza, where nearly 30,000 have been killed according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and disease and hunger have gripped much of the population.
Last week, the United Nations food agency paused aid to northern Gaza, citing Israeli gunfire and “complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order”, amid increasing reports of famine.
The amount of aid reaching Gaza fell by half in February compared with January, the UN has said, as its secretary general, António Guterres, warned an Israeli assault on Rafah would be “the nail in the coffin” of deliveries to the territory.
US officials hope a multi-week pause in fighting could offer a path to ending the war. But Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed any truce deal would delay, not prevent, a ground invasion of Rafah in the far south of the Gaza Strip.
“I’ve set three war goals. The first is to release the hostages. The second is to destroy Hamas. And the third is to ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel in the future,” he said, speaking on CBS’s Face of the Nation. “Understand that unless we have total victory, we can’t have peace. We can’t leave Hamas in place.”
Netanyahu’s office on Monday said the military had shown Israel’s war cabinet its plan for evacuating civilians from Rafah, but no details have been released on where those displaced people could go.
Meanwhile, Netanyahu has faced increasing public pressure over the fate of hostages still held in Gaza, and from a resurgent anti-government protest movement.
In Israel, municipal elections twice delayed by the fighting will be held Tuesday in a poll which could gauge the public mood nearly five months into Israel’s war against Hamas.
The offensive on Gaza followed an attack in Israel by Hamas on 7 October that killed about 1,200 people and in which more than 200 people were taken hostage. About 100 hostages were freed in exchange for a week-long pause as part of an earlier deal. Israeli officials believe about 130 hostages remain in Gaza.
Biden’s comments on the ceasefire came hours after an active-duty member of the US air force died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington, to protest against the war in Gaza.
The situation has become politically complicated for the US president, who is vying for votes in the US presidential primary elections. Ahead of a primary election in Michigan on Tuesday, activists have urged Democrats to mark their ballots “uncommitted” rather than support Biden, to push the president to change course and call for a permanent ceasefire.

"German minister says she clapped Israeli film-maker, not his Palestinian colleague, at Berlinale",2024-02-27,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/27/german-minister-says-she-was-only-applauding-israeli-filmmaker-at-berlinale,"Call for Green politician to resign amid row over politically charged closing ceremony at film festival
Germany’s minister of state for culture has insisted she was only clapping the Israeli but not the Palestinian half of a film-making duo that won one of the major awards at the politically charged closing ceremony for the Berlin film festival.
At Saturday night’s awards event, the Palestinian film-maker Basel Adra and the Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham jointly took to the stage on Saturday to accept the best documentary prize for their joint film No Other Land, which charts the eradication of Palestinian villages in the West Bank.
Adra said he struggled to celebrate his film’s success while people in Gaza were “being slaughtered and massacred”, and urged Germany to cease arms exports to Israel. Speaking immediately afterwards, Abraham decried a “situation of apartheid” that meant that his film-making partner did not enjoy the same voting rights and freedom of movement even though they lived only 30 minutes apart.
Abraham ended his acceptance speech with a call for a ceasefire in Gaza, and for a “political solution to end the occupation”. The moment was one of several on the night in which film-makers expressed solidarity with the Palestinian cause in the conflict. The massacre perpetrated by Hamas militants on 7 October was mentioned once, in an opening statement by the Berlinale co-director, Mariëtte Rissenbeek, that called for the release of Israeli hostages.
In Germany, where the government has tacked strongly behind the Israeli government since the start of the conflict, politicians were quick to condemn the event. Berlin’s conservative mayor, Kai Wegner, described the speeches at the Berlinale closing ceremony as an “intolerable relativisation”.
“The full responsibility for the deep suffering in Israel and the Gaza strip lies with Hamas,” Wegner wrote on X.
Even though the 10-day film festival’s winners are chosen by independent juries made up of international film professionals, opposition politicians also blamed Germany’s federal commissioner for culture, the Green party politician Claudia Roth, as being responsible for the comments made on-stage.
A delegate for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) called for Roth’s resignation, while a politician for the Free Democratic party (FDP) proposed that the film festival’s state funding be withdrawn.
The Berlinale, one of the big three European film festivals alongside Cannes and Venice, was financed by the German state with about €12.9m this year, roughly a third of its overall budget.
Roth reacted on Monday by issuing a statement that called the statements at the gala “shockingly one-sided and characterised by deep hatred of Israel”, saying the lack of a mention of Hamas’s terror attack was “not acceptable”.
Footage of the awards ceremony, however, put further pressure on the minister of state: in a panoramic shot of the auditorium at the end of Adra and Abraham’s acceptance speech, Roth and Wegner are clearly visible clapping their hands.
In a statement on X on Monday, Roth’s office tried to clarify that her applause “was directed at the Jewish-Israeli journalist and filmmaker Yuval Abraham, who spoke out in favour of a political solution and a peaceful co-existence in the region”.
While the conflict in the Middle East divides opinion across western societies, it is proving especially explosive in Germany’s culture sector, where a strong pro-Israel consensus across the main political parties and media publishers is rubbing up against a more politically heterogenous crowd of international artists, who have been drawn to Berlin by its liberal reputation and generous cultural subsidies.
In a separate development, the Berlin film festival’s directors announced on Monday that it had filed criminal charges after the hacking of its Panorama section’s Instagram account, which was used to post messages in support of Palestine. Under German law, at least one of the slogans posted can be classified as antisemitic and illegal.
One of the images posted on Sunday showed what appeared to be Palestinian children next to the message “Ceasefire now – Stop the genocide in Gaza”, while another read: “Gaza, mon amour – End the German-funded state terror”.
A third picture, showing a man on a horse, contained the words “Free Palestine – from the river to the sea”. While the “From the river to the sea” slogan predates the current war in the Middle East by several decades, it has arguably taken on a new, genocidal meaning after 7 October. Last October, the Berlin state’s prosecutor’s office announced the phrase was subject to criminal penalties because it negates Israel’s existence.
“These statements do not originate from the festival and do not represent the festival’s stance”, the Berlin film festival said in a statement. “The posts were deleted immediately and an investigation was launched into how this incident could have occurred.”

What we know so far about the draft Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal,2024-02-27,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/27/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-draft-israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal,"Agreements on fighting, hostage and prisoner releases and aid in Gaza are part of terms the two sides could sign up to
The US president, Joe Biden, said he hoped a deal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza and hostage release could be reached by next Monday, as negotiators for Israel and Hamas try to pin down the terms of a draft agreement.
The framework for a halt to fighting was drawn up in Paris, at meetings with envoys from Qatar, the US and Egypt, and has now been presented to Hamas. It envisions a 40-day break in fighting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which will start around 10 March.
Israeli hostages would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and an increase of aid supplies into Gaza, as well as equipment and fuel to start rebuilding. Palestinian women, children and elderly people would be allowed to return to the north of the strip.
One reason for Biden’s optimism may have been Israel’s reported agreement to release high-profile Palestinian prisoners convicted of major terrorism charges as part of the deal. Under a US proposal, 15 of these prisoners would be exchanged for five female Israeli soldiers, the New York Times reported.
These releases would face heavy scrutiny in Israel, but the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is under heavy domestic pressure to do more to secure the release of hostages, which may nudge him towards compromise.
Hamas leaders too appear to be softening their stance. After a first ceasefire and hostage release deal collapsed at the start of December, the group has repeatedly said it would release remaining hostages only as part of a permanent truce.
The agreement drawn up in Paris envisages continuing talks for a long-term arrangement, but initially just a 40-day break in fighting.
The main terms of the draft deal, as reported by Reuters, are as follows:
 Ceasefire: Both sides would stop all military operations. Israel would move its troops away from densely populated areas and halt drone surveillance for eight hours every day.
 Hostage release: Hamas would release 40 Israeli hostages. Those set to be released include women, children and young adults under 19 years of age, people over 50 and the sick. Men of military age would not be covered in this deal.
 Prisoner release: In return, Israel would release 400 prisoners, in a ratio of 10 for every freed hostage. This is a much higher ratio than under the last ceasefire deal, when three prisoners were released for every freed hostage.
 Aid and reconstruction: Israel would allow 500 trucks a day of humanitarian aid into Gaza, along with 200,000 tents and 60,000 caravans to house the displaced.
Fuel and equipment to rebuild hospitals and bakeries would be allowed into Gaza and Hamas would promise not to use this to threaten Isreal.
Despite signs both sides may be open to compromise, officials from Israel, Hamas and Qatar – a key intermediary in talks – said significant differences remained and a deal was still a long way off.
A Hamas official said Biden’s comments were “premature” and did not reflect the situation on the ground, Reuters reported. An Israeli website, Ynet, quoted senior Israeli officials saying they did not understand why Biden seemed so confident about the deal.
Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson on Tuesday said there had been no breakthrough, as Israel and Hamas could not reach agreement on the main issues, though he added the country was “upbeat and optimistic” about mediation prospects.
A previous deal, in November 2023, lasted seven days before collapsing in acrimonious accusations of bad faith from both sides.
Under that agreement 105 civilians were released by Hamas, 81 of which were Israeli women and children. Hamas also released 23 Thai nationals and one Filipino.
Israel released 240 prisoners in exchange. Of those, 107 were children, 66 were 18-year-old teenage boys, and another teenager who had turned 19 in prison. The rest were women. Three-quarters had not been convicted of any crime.

Hamas and Israel pour cold water on Biden’s hopes of imminent ceasefire,2024-02-27,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/27/hamas-and-israel-pour-cold-water-on-bidens-hopes-of-imminent-ceasefire,"US president’s remarks that there could be truce by Monday are ‘premature’, says political head of Hamas in Gaza
Israeli and Hamas officials have downplayed hopes expressed by Joe Biden that a ceasefire in the war in Gaza is imminent, raising questions about whether a temporary truce can be implemented before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins in two weeks’ time.
Basem Naim, the head of Hamas’s political division in Gaza, said over WhatsApp on Tuesday that the Palestinian Islamist movement had not yet formally received a new proposal for a ceasefire since last week’s indirect talks in Paris mediated by the US, Egypt and Qatar.
The US leader’s remarks late on Monday that a temporary truce could be implemented as soon as 4 March were “premature” and did “not match the reality on the ground”, he said. Ahmad Abdel-Hadi, a Hamas representative in Beirut, also told a Lebanese broadcaster that significant progress on a deal had not been made.
Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that Biden’s comments came as a surprise and were not made in coordination with the country’s leadership. Hamas was continuing to push “excessive demands”, they said.
The remarks pour cold water on comments made by Biden in New York on Monday. “My national security adviser tells me that we’re close. We’re close. We’re not done yet,” Biden told reporters after taping an appearance on NBC’s Late Night With Seth Meyers. “My hope is by next Monday, we’ll have a ceasefire.”
During the Meyers interview, Biden also said Israel would be willing to temporarily halt its war during the fasting month if a deal were reached to release some of the hostages.
“Ramadan’s coming up and there has been an agreement by the Israelis that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan as well, in order to give us time to get all the hostages out,” Biden said.
Stemming the bloodshed in Gaza has been a difficult diplomatic task in the nearly five-month-old war sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel in which, according to Israeli figures, about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 abducted. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed almost 30,000 people, displaced more than 85% of the 2.3 million population from their homes and left more than half of the strip’s infrastructure in ruins, according to data from Gaza’s health ministry and the UN.
A November truce in which about 100 hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians in Israeli jails collapsed after a week, and progress on a second deal has proved elusive. With two weeks until Ramadan – a period in which tensions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict often spike, even in quieter years – desperate civilians in Gaza, the relatives of the remaining hostages and international mediators are all aware that time may be running out to broker a comprehensive ceasefire.
The latest proposal under review reportedly includes a 40-day pause in all military operations, as well as the exchange of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages at a ratio of 10 to one.
Under the terms, hospitals and bakeries in Gaza would be repaired, 500 aid trucks would enter into the besieged territory each day, and thousands of tents and caravans would be delivered to house displaced people. Civilians, other than men of military age, would gradually be allowed to return to northern Gaza.
The draft also reportedly states that Hamas would free 40 Israeli hostages including women, children under 19, people over 50 and the sick, while Israel would release about 400 Palestinian prisoners, including some high-profile prisoners convicted of terrorism offences.
The number and identity of released prisoners and hostages has to date been a particular sticking point in talks since the first ceasefire collapsed at the beginning of December. Whether female soldiers were part of the first group of hostages released was still under discussion, Israeli media reported on Tuesday.
Hamas’s exiled leadership in Qatar has repeatedly said that it will not release hostages without a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip – demands that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has called “delusional”.
The cautious tone from both sides on the feasibility of a ceasefire was met with dismay by Palestinians trapped in the 365 sq km territory, where a lack of aid, food and water means that one in four people are facing extreme hunger.
Netanyahu has said repeatedly that a temporary ceasefire would not stave off a threatened Israeli ground offensive on Rafah, the southernmost town in Gaza, which has become the last refuge for more than half of the population.
Widespread destruction and continuing fighting across the territory, two-thirds of which is already under Israeli evacuation orders, means it is unclear how or where civilians are expected to flee. Global condemnation of the humanitarian cost of such an offensive has not deterred Israeli decision makers, who say a Rafah operation is an essential element of its goal to destroy Hamas.
A total of 96 people were killed in the past 24 hours, Gaza’s health ministry said, in at least 52 strikes across the strip. The Israeli army said troops had “eliminated” several militants inside a tunnel in a raid on the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, an area which has supposedly been under Israeli control since November.
In northern Gaza, people on the brink of famine have been forced to eat animal feed and even leaves. Aid deliveries, which the UN has warned are a fraction of what is needed, are increasingly not arriving at designated distribution points after being raided by desperate people or armed gangs.
“I have not eaten for two days,” Mahmud Khodr, a resident of Jabalia refugee camp in the north, where children roamed with empty pots in search of food, told Agence France-Presse. “There is nothing to eat or drink.”
Late on Tuesday Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, told Reuters it would halt fire on Israel if there was a truce in Gaza, a welcome development after near daily tit-for-tat fire between the two enemies since 7 October. It is widely feared that miscalculation or conflagration on the disputed blue line between Israel and Lebanon could spark a wider Middle East war.
Qatari mediators also said they remained optimistic a deal could be brokered for Gaza.
“The efforts are ongoing, all the parties are conducting regular meetings,” Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson for the Qatari foreign ministry, told reporters in Doha. “But for now, while we certainly hope it will be achieved as soon as possible, we don’t have anything in our hands so as to comment on that deadline.”

Qatar and Egypt ‘will help form new Palestinian technocratic government’,2024-02-27,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/27/qatar-and-egypt-will-help-form-new-palestinian-technocratic-government,"Palestinian ambassador to UK says Hamas will be consulted but would have no members in government
The formation of a new Palestinian technocratic government would be aided by both Qatar and Egypt and involves consultations with all Palestinian political factions – including Hamas, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot, has said.
The move appears to be part of an attempt to show that a reformed interim Palestinian government that has roots in the entire Palestinian movement is ready to take over the governance of both Gaza and the West Bank soon after any ceasefire.
Zomlot stressed Hamas would have no members in the new technocratic government, but the fact that it would be consulted showed efforts were under way to see if Palestinian unity between Hamas and Fatah was achievable.
The Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, and his government resigned en masse on Monday, confirming that its recent attempts at internal reform had not been extensive enough.
The two factions have been divided since Hamas threw the Fatah movement out of Gaza in 2007. Zomlot stressed this would be a purely technocratic government without factions, saying: “It is designed to unify the Palestinians, their geography and polity.”
“The political landscape has changed. This is the time to hear our people, and not the time for political factions. We have a responsibility to provide a government that can provide for its people, unite our people, and political system. The twin tasks of the government was to provide humanitarian support and prepare for elections, as well as economic reforms.”
Talks on relations between the factions are due to start this week in Moscow.
Zomlot said he hoped the technocratic government would be followed by both Palestinian parliamentary and presidential elections, once wounds had healed. He did not set a precise timeline for this ambition, but said it would be a matter of months not years. Palestine has not held elections since January 2006, and the US has been insisting that as part of a revitalised Palestinian government fresh elections must be held in which the current president, Mahmoud Abbas, would stand aside.
At present, polls suggest Hamas rather than Fatah, the party with which Zomlot is associated, would win, but gauging opinion at present is hard, and may depend on how the ceasefire is reached.
Zomlot said progress may depend on the degree to which Israeli government rightwingers allow the technocratic government to govern by no longer depriving them of revenue and restricting movement on the West Bank.
Zomlot, who has been mentioned as a future president or prime minister, framed the formation of the Palestinian technocratic government for the entire occupied territories as part of a wider agreed strategy including an immediate and permanent ceasefire that allows for a “hostage swap”, removal of Israel from every inch of Palestinian territory, the launch of a reconstruction program in Gaza, a vote at the UN security council backing full UN recognition of Palestine, an international peace conference to agree short timetables for formation of two states including security arrangements, accountability for war crimes against Palestinians.
These extensive demands are unlikely to be met in full and are anyway predicated on a permanent ceasefire involving a swap of hostages and prisoners.
Zomlot sounded doubtful that Hamas and the Israeli government would agree to a ceasefire on the kind of swift timetable set out by the US president, Joe Biden, on Monday night.
He said: “Benjamin Netanyahu so far sees the end of this aggression as the end of his political career. He is bragging and gaslighting all of us. He talks about possible agreements and he is just buying time. He knows how to play the game of deceit, and words, and then is good at the game of blame. Elements of his government are interested in ethnic cleansing, and they make no secret of it. They have a plan and have been waiting for the right moment to implement the plan.”
Zomlot said that due to the level of destruction and state of famine, ”it is likely that another 10,000 Palestinians will die even if a ceasefire was achieved now”.
He said an Israeli ground attack in Rafah “will bring untold casualties and despair. There are 6,000 people per kilometre. If Israel went about this the way it did in the North of Gaza, Israel will kill tens of thousands, and we think Rafah is the final push for mass expulsion. That is why it must be prevented and here the US must not mince its words.”
He said the only way to stop Netanyahu was for the US and the UK to stop supplying arms to Israel.
His aides fear that some of the phraseology coming from the US security officials suggest Washington, despite its warnings, is going to greenlight the land offensive in Rafah on the basis that Israel has constructed a credible plan that will shift the refugees within Gaza once again, leaving Hamas exposed to a final Israeli attack.

Houthis deny targeting underwater cables amid marine disaster warning,2024-02-28,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/28/houthis-deny-targeting-underwater-cables-marine-disaster-warning-red-sea,"Yemeni government warns of Red Sea environmental disaster after cargo ship struck by rebels last week
Houthi leaders have denied they have targeted critical underwater sea telecommunication cables, as Yemen’s UN-recognised government warned of an imminent marine environmental disaster if a cargo ship struck by the rebels last week was not quickly rescued.
The Rubymar, a Belize-flagged but British-owned bulk carrier, has been drifting in the Red Sea after it was struck by two missiles. The ship, which is feared to be in danger of sinking, is leaking an 18-mile oil spill and carrying 41,000 tonnes of volatile fertiliser.
The 22 February attack on the Rubymar inflicted the most significant damage so far on a commercial ship since the Houthis started targeting vessels in November. The Houthis say their attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea are in solidarity with the stricken people of Gaza.
It has long been feared that the Houthis might extend their actions by disrupting internet traffic and cutting sea cables.
Sixteen small fibre-optic lines across the bed of the Red Sea carry about 17% of all international data traffic, including trunk lines connecting Europe with India and east Asia.
It was reported on Monday that cables belonging to four big telecom networks – including the Asia-Africa-Europe 1 (AAE-1), TGN Atlantic, Europe India Gateway and the Seacom system – have been damaged in recent months. The cause of the damage has not been identified and natural damage happens relatively regularly.
Israeli media reports attributed the damage to Houthi actions, but Yemen’s Houthi-controlled communications ministry denied involvement.
Seacom has confirmed that its cable between Egypt and Kenya was severed on 24 February and it is investigating. Some of these lines are in relatively shallow water depths of as little as 300ft, where they could be accessible to divers.
The internationally recognised government of Yemen issued a warning of the potential Houthi threat to these subsea assets earlier this month, and has reportedly discussed it with telecom operators in the past.
The Houthis, an Islamist movement that seized Yemen’s capital in 2015, insist they are solely targeting Israeli-linked ships in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, and say they will consider ending the months-long attacks if Hamas agreed a ceasefire.
The UK and the US have been mounting successive attacks on Yemen’s missile sites, but privately admit the best they can do is slow the pace and intensity of the attacks on shipping.
Tareq Saleh, a member of the Presidential Leadership Council of the UN-recognised government, is in London to meet Foreign Office officials to discuss the Houthi attacks on commercial shipping, the threat to submarine cables, and the possibility of an environmental disaster caused by the strike on the Rubymar.
Saleh is the nephew of the late president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who ruled Yemen for 22 years from 1990, the moment of Yemen’s reunification and was killed by the Houthis.
Saleh will want to discuss what help the UN-recognised government could provide to the British in targeting Houthi sites.
Saleh has to tread a politically delicate line since he, along with almost all Yemenis, is a fierce opponent of Israel’s actions in Gaza, and has to balance criticism of UK foreign policy to Gaza with its willingness to help the US and the UK stop the Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
The director of the environment public authority, Faisal Al-Thalabi, said: The condition of the Rubymar was very bad and footage shows the ships tilting severely and close to sinking. Efforts are being made to tow the ship to Djibouti on the other side of the Red Sea to Yemen.”

Middle East crisis: Biden says killing of more than 100 Palestinians near aid trucks will complicate ceasefire talks – as it happened,2024-02-29,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/29/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-israel-hamas-war-latest-today-gaza-death-toll-hamas-health-ministry,"This live blog is now closed. For the latest on the Israel-Gaza war, read our most recent report:
Joe Biden said moments ago outside the White House, while on his way to the US-Mexico border, that he’s reviewing the reports of Israeli troops shooting people crowding for desperately needed food aid in Gaza – but he already is clear that that the deadly incident will complicate talks on a ceasefire.
“I know it will,” the US president told reporters gathering on the south lawn at the White House as he left for a visit to the US-Mexico border today, when asked whether the tragedy Gaza unfolding in would complicate negotiations.
Health authorities in Gaza said the IDF fired on people waiting for aid near Gaza City on Thursday had killed 104 Palestinians and wounded 280, with one hospital saying it had received 10 bodies and dozens of injured patients, Reuters adds.
Biden added:
We’re checking that out right now. There’s two competing versions of what happened. I don’t have an answer yet.
The president also said that his previous comments that he hoped for a temporary ceasefire by Monday, in the battle Israel is waging in Gaza with the goal of destroying Hamas, would now “probably not” happen.
Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures by the territory’s health ministry on Thursday.
More than 100 Palestinians were killed as they gathered to receive humanitarian aid in Gaza City on Thursday, health officials said. At least 112 people were killed and more than 280 wounded in the incident, the Palestinian health ministry said.
There were conflicting reports about events leading up to the deaths. Witnesses said Israeli troops fired on a large crowd of Palestinians racing to pull food off an aid convoy, and Gaza’s health ministry described it as a “massacre”. Israel challenged the death toll and said many of the victims were run over by the trucks.
Hamas warned it could end hostage release negotiations after the incident. In a statement, it said: “The negotiations conducted by the movement’s leadership are not an open process at the expense of the blood of our people.”
Joe Biden acknowledged the deadly incident will complicate talks on a ceasefire. The US president told reporters he was reviewing the reports and said “there’s two competing versions of what happened. I don’t have an answer yet.” The US is urgently seeking information on what took place in northern Gaza, a spokesperson for the US state department has said.
Israel’s military published a video of what it claimed were people looting aid trucks in Gaza in the buildup to the incident. Due to forced relocation and the lack of access to aid, agencies have warned that much of the population in Gaza is suffering from food deprivation, with one in six children under the age of two found to be malnourished during screening in January, and reports yesterday that one in five pregnant women seen in a Gaza clinic are also malnourished.
Egypt and Jordan issued separate statements condemning Israel after the incident. Egypt said: “We consider targeting peaceful citizens rushing to pick up their share of aid a shameful crime and a flagrant violation of international law”.
Two Israeli men have been killed in a shooting attack at a gas station in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Thursday, Israel’s army and medics said. The Israeli military said the gunman was “neutralised” by security forces, adding that troops were pursuing other suspects in the area.
The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has said more than 25,000 women and children had been killed by Israel since 7 October. Austin added that about 21,000 precision-guided munitions had been provided to Israel since the start of its war in Gaza.
Israel is reviewing possible curbs on access to al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem over the upcoming Ramadan fasting month, a government spokesperson said. Far-right interior security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said last week there would be a quota for people wishing to take part in prayers at the al-Aqsa mosque during Ramadan. Israel has been restricting the numbers attending the mosque since 7 October.
The archbishop of Canterbury has expressed his deep regret at his decision to refuse to meet a renowned Palestinian pastor if he shared a political platform with the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Justin Welby said in a post on social media he would now meet the Rev Dr Munther Isaac next week.
The pastor of the Christmas Evangelical Lutheran church in Bethlehem, who has been highly critical of Israel in Gaza, saw his Christmas sermon go viral when he said if Jesus Christ was born today it would have been under the rubble.
He revealed the archbishop had refused to meet him in an interview with the Guardian.
Welby said on Thursday:
Recently I declined to meet with Rev Dr Munther Isaac during his UK visit. I apologise for and deeply regret this decision, and the hurt, anger, and confusion it caused.
I was wrong not to meet with my brother in Christ from the Holy Land, especially at this time of profound suffering for our Palestinian Christian brothers and sisters. I look forward to speaking and praying with him next week.
Isaac replied:
Thank you archbishop. I welcome this statement, and I look forward to our meeting next week as brothers in Christ.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) was not involved in the aid distribution in northern Gaza today that turned deadly and resulted in the deaths of more than 100 people, the head of the agency has said.
“Another day from hell,” UNRWA commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini posted to social media, noting that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the outbreak of war in October. He wrote:
An additional 100 people are reportedly killed & 700 injured when they were desperately trying to get lifesaving humanitarian aid from a convoy.
Neither UNRWA nor any other UN agency were involved in this distribution. When will this madness end?
Another day from hell.#Gaza reaches an unprecedented reported death toll of 30,000 Palestinians killed, while an additional 100 people are reportedly killed & 700 injured when they were desperately trying to get lifesaving humanitarian aid from a convoy.Neither @UNRWA nor any…
The US is urgently seeking information on what took place in northern Gaza, where health authorities said more than 100 Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces as they waited for an aid delivery, a spokesperson for the US state department has said.
Matthew Miller, speaking to reporters, said the US understands that Israel is conducting an investigation of the incident.
We are urgently seeking additional information on exactly what took place. We have been in touch with the Israeli government since early this morning and understand that an investigation is underway. We will be monitoring that investigation closely and pressing for answers.
He added that Washington continues to make clear to Israel that all possible measures must be taken to allow the entry of more aid into Gaza.
Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, has said he is confident that the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah would adhere to a ceasefire if Israel did the same in Gaza.
Mikati, in an interview with Reuters, said a halt to fighting in the Gaza Strip as early as next week would trigger indirect talks to end hostilities along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel.
He said a deal to halt military action in Gaza was “on the horizon” and could begin as early as next week, adding:
If we are able to reach a cessation of military operations in Gaza, then I believe that we will have ahead of us weeks packed with negotiations, so that we can reach what I have always called long-term stability in the south.
Asked whether Hezbollah had signalled a willingness to move forward with talks, the Lebanese leader suggested the “cooperation” shown by “all sides” to facilitate the maritime deal could be replicated for a land border deal. He said:
I am certain that the moment that Israel stops its violations against Lebanon, I am convinced that Hezbollah will not violate – or will not respond to something that did not happen.
Hezbollah itself has indicated it was ready to halt its cross-border attacks if a Gaza ceasefire comes into force.
Joe Biden discussed the “tragic and alarming incident” in northern Gaza with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar, as well as ways to secure the release of Hamas hostages and a six-week ceasefire, the White House said.
A readout of a call between the US president and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, said the two leaders “underscored that the release of hostages would result in an immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza over a period of at least six weeks”. It continued:
Both leaders grieved the loss of civilian lives and agreed that this incident underscored the urgency of bringing negotiations to a close as soon as possible and expanding the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza.
The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, condemns the “incident” in northern Gaza in which “more than 100 people were reportedly killed or injured while seeking life-saving aid”, a statement from his spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said.
The statement reads:
The Secretary-General condemns the incident today in northern Gaza in which more than a hundred people were reportedly killed or injured while seeking life-saving aid. The desperate civilians in Gaza need urgent help, including those in the besieged north where the United Nations has not been able to deliver aid in more than a week.
Here are some images from the newswires from Gaza City, after more than 100 Palestinians were killed as they waited for an aid convoy on Thursday, bringing the total death toll since the start of the war in Gaza to more than 30,000, according to Palestinian health officials.
Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has called for an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza and urged Israel to protect the Palestinian population.
Posting to social media on Thursday, Tajani wrote:
The tragic deaths in Gaza demand an immediate ceasefire to facilitate more humanitarian aid, the release of hostages and the protection of civilians.
His comments came hours after the news that more than 100 Palestinians were killed as they waited for an aid delivery in Gaza City.
Tajani called on Israel to “rigorously ascertain facts and responsibilities” regarding the incident, which Gaza’s health ministry has described as a “massacre” and blamed Israeli troops. Israel has claimed that many of the victims had been run over by the aid lorries.
Le tragiche morti a #Gaza richiedono un immediato cessate il fuoco per favorire più aiuti umanitari, la liberazione degli ostaggi e la protezione dei civili. Chiediamo con forza ad #Israele di tutelare la popolazione a Gaza e di accertare, con rigore, fatti e responsabilità.
Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, expressed her “deep dismay and concern” over the violence, calling on Israel to “urgently ascertain the dynamics of the incident and relative responsibilities”.
Two Israeli men have been killed in a shooting attack at a gas station in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Thursday, Israel’s army and medics said.
The Israeli military said the gunman was “neutralised” by security forces, adding that troops were pursuing other suspects in the area.
A spokesperson for Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency response service, said it received a report at about 5pm local time of gunshot wounds at a gas station near the Eli settlement.
It added:
We performed medical tests, but ... in a short time we had to determine their death.
The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said earlier today that more than 25,000 women and children had been killed by Israel since 7 October 2023, adding that Israel can and should do more to protect civilians.
During a US congressional hearing (ostensibly about his health), Austin was asked how many Palestinian women and children had been killed by Israel, Reuters reports.
He said:
It is over 25,000.
Austin added that about 21,000 precision-guided munitions had been provided to Israel since the start of its war in Gaza.
Meanwhile, beyond the Reuters report, this is an extraordinary figure not just in the tragedy of it but in the mathematics of it. Lt Col Peter Lerner, the spokesman of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), moments ago told CNN in a live interview with anchor Wolf Blitzer that Israel has killed “12,000 Hamas terrorists” in its war in Gaza since Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October.
This morning, the Gaza health ministry said that the death toll in Gaza at the hands of Israel since then has surpassed 30,000 and the reality on the ground is probably higher.

"112 dead in chaotic scenes as Israeli troops open fire near aid trucks, say Gaza officials",2024-03-01,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/29/more-than-a-hundred-dead-after-israeli-troops-opened-fire-near-aid-trucks-say-gaza-officials,"Israeli military denies shooting into large crowds of hungry people and says most were killed in crush or run over trying to escape 
More than a hundred Palestinians were killed in the early hours of Thursday morning, Gaza health officials said, when desperate crowds gathered around aid trucks and Israeli troops opened fire, in an incident that the US president, Joe Biden, warned was likely to complicate ceasefire talks.
There were starkly different accounts of how the victims died in the chaos that took place near Gaza City in the north of the strip.
Israel’s military denied shooting into large crowds of hungry people and said most were killed in a crush or run over by trucks trying to escape. Soldiers only fired at a small group that moved away from the trucks and threatened a checkpoint, a spokesperson said.
As the UN security council convened an emergency session on Thursday night, the White House called for the deaths to be “thoroughly investigated” and reminded Israel that it needs to provide basic security in areas of Gaza under its control.
Witnesses and survivors described bullets hitting crowds around the aid trucks, and Mohammed Salha, acting director of the al-Awda hospital, which treated 161 casualties, said most appeared to have been shot.
However, another Palestinian witness told the BBC that most of the dead had been run over by lorries.
Gaza health officials said at least 112 people were killed and 280 injured after Israeli forces opened fire on an aid distribution point.
Ali Awad Ashqir, who said he had gone to get some food for his starving family, told the news agencyAFP he had been waiting for two hours when trucks began to arrive.
“The moment they arrived, the occupation army fired artillery shells and guns,” he said.
Israeli army spokesperon Daniel Hagari later denied Israeli forces carried out any shelling or strikes at the time.
The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said it was an “ugly massacre conducted by the Israeli occupation army on people who waited for aid trucks at the Nabulsi roundabout”.
Biden said the US was checking “two competing versions” of the incident and said the bloodshed would complicate efforts to broker a deal to stop the fighting and release Israeli hostages before the holy month of Ramadan, which starts on 10 March. The White House called the deaths “tremendously alarming”.
State department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters the US was “urgently seeking additional information on exactly what took place”.
Washington will be monitoring an upcoming investigation closely and “pressing for answers”, he said.
Hamas said the incident could jeopardise talks in Qatar. The group would not allow talks “to be a cover for the enemy to continue its crimes”, it said.
France’s foreign ministry said “the fire by Israeli soldiers against civilians trying to access food is unjustifiable”.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
“Deep indignation at the images coming from Gaza where civilians have been targeted by Israeli soldiers. I express my strongest condemnation of these shootings and call for truth, justice, and respect for international law,” Macron said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Turkey accused Israel of committing “another crime against humanity” and condemning Gazans to “famine” as civilians scavenge for dwindling supplies of food.
“The fact that Israel... this time targets innocent civilians in a queue for humanitarian aid, is evidence that (Israel) aims consciously and collectively to destroy the Palestinian people”, the Turkish foreign ministry said.
Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro denounced what he called a “genocide” of the Palestinian people and suspended purchases of weapons from Israel, a key supplier of his country’s security forces.
“Asking for food, more than 100 Palestinians were killed by [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu. This is called genocide and recalls the Holocaust,” Petro wrote on X. “The world must block Netanyahu.”
The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the deaths would require effective independent investigation and that he was “shocked” by the incident.
The Palestinian ambassador to the UN pleaded for the Security Council to condemn the episode. “The Security Council should say enough is enough,” Riyad Mansour told reporters ahead of the closed-door meeting by the body, which came at the request of Algeria.
The death toll from Israeli attacks on Gaza has now passed 30,000. With more than 70,000 others injured, and thousands more uncounted victims buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings, nearly one in 20 of the prewar population of Gaza are now casualties of attacks.
The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said earlier on Thursday that more than 25,000 women and children had been killed by Israel since 7 October 2023, adding that Israel could and should do more to protect civilians.
The survivors are stalked by hunger, with “pockets of starvation” reported particularly in the north, and widespread malnutrition that has already killed some children. There are also severe shortages of medical supplies, clean water and shelter.
The desperation of crowds who died trying to reach the food aid underlined the extent of shortages in the north around Gaza City. UN officials have described a blockade within a blockade, with additional Israeli controls that make it even harder to get supplies into northern Gaza than the south.
One injured survivor, Kamel Abu Nahel, said he went to the aid distribution point in the middle of the night because he hoped for food supplies, after two months of eating animal feed.
After trucks arrived and a crowd gathered, Israeli soldiers opened fire, so people scattered to seek shelter but returned once the gunfire stopped, he told the AP news agency. However the troops opened fire again, and Abu Nahel was shot in the leg then run over by a truck that was speeding away.
There were so many wounded that some were taken to hospitals in donkey carts; videos shared on social media appeared to show medics walking beside one piled with victims. Hospital corridors were crowded with survivors and relatives.
The Israeli military spokesperson Lt Col Peter Lerner said most casualties were caused by a crush around some trucks in the convoy after they first passed the Israeli military checkpoint into northern Gaza.
Later, crowds chasing the final truck in the convoy turned and moved back towards the checkpoint, he said, prompting troops to fire warning shots, and then lethal rounds in self-defence. The Israeli military released footage of crowds round the trucks which it said showed the lethal crush but not the shooting incident.
Lerner declined to say how much time elapsed between the crush and the shooting, or estimate casualties in either, saying only he did not believe the Palestinian toll.
It was not clear who had supplied the trucks of food. The UN agency for Palestine, Unrwa, has not sent an aid convoy to northern Gaza since 5 February, when its trucks were attacked by the Israeli navy even though the delivery had been approved for transit. Lerner said he did not know who sent the aid.
There are thought to be about 300,000 people still living in northern Gaza, months after Israel ordered all civilians to leave.
Some were not able to travel, others feared they would not find a place to stay in the crammed shelters of the south, felt that with strikes all over Gaza they preferred to take their chances at home, or worried Israeli forces would not allow them to return if they headed south.
“We think that this latest event needs to be thoroughly investigated,” a White House spokesperson, Olivia Dalton, said, adding that the US had asked Israel for more information.
“We have consistently and vocally communicated to our Israeli counterparts the need for there to be viable plans to maintain basic security in areas of Gaza where military operations against Hamas have concluded.
The UN security council held an emergency sessions behind closed doors on the Gazan deaths on Thursday amid fresh international demands for a ceasefire. The UN’s undersecretary for humanitarian affairs, Martin Griffiths, said: “Life is draining out of Gaza at terrifying speed.”
Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said: “The tragic deaths in Gaza demand an immediate ceasefire to facilitate more humanitarian aid, the release of hostages and the protection of civilians.”
In the region, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan accused Israel of targeting civilians, and separately called for more aid to reach Gaza and greater international pressure on Israel to reach a ceasefire deal.
In February barely 100 trucks a day of aid had reached Gaza, just half the amount that got through in January, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, told journalists on a visit to Jerusalem.
And it is just a trickle compared with the 500 trucks that went in daily with food and medical aid before the war started in October. Then Gaza had a functioning economy, agriculture sector and commercial imports, with many people feeding themselves.
After Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and in which more than 200 people were kidnapped and taken to Gaza, Israel tightened a years-long blockade to halt entry of most food, water and medical supplies to Gaza. It says the controls on supplies are vital to its war on Hamas, and efforts to recover hostages.
With much of Gaza in ruins and the majority of its population displaced from their homes, almost everyone now relies on aid. Lazzarini described the restrictions as a siege that had brought the strip to the brink of an unprecedented human-made famine.
“What’s extraordinary in this conflict is the man-made widespread hunger and even looming starvation and famine in some pockets,” he said. “The type of situation or siege being imposed on the Gaza Strip since October 7 has led to a situation not seen anywhere else in the world.
“Within four or five months, suddenly we talk about a famine, which is absolutely easy to reverse because to reverse it depends only and exclusively on the proper political will.”
There have been airdrops of food aid in recent days into parts of Gaza. But while these could work well for specialised medical equipment and other needs, Lazzarini said, they were an “extraordinarily expensive” way to deliver food that could not be scaled up to address the levels of hunger in Gaza.
Israel says that it does not impose limits on aid shipments into Gaza, and blames the logistical failures of UN agencies and humanitarian organisations for failing to process and distribute enough aid.

Middle East crisis: Germany joins calls for Israel to ‘fully explain … mass panic and shooting’ at Gaza aid site – as it happened,2024-03-01,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/01/gaza-aid-convoy-deaths-israel-middle-east-crisis-live-latest-news,"Comments by foreign minister Annalena Baerbock follow interventions by France and US after 112 Palestinians killed. This live blog is now closed
Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has demanded that Israel’s army “fully explain” how Palestinians ended up dead yesterday while they were gathered to receive humanitarian aid, an event which she said had shocked her.
In a post on social media, she said:
People wanted relief supplies for themselves and their families and found themselves dead. The reports from Gaza shock me. The Israeli army must fully explain how the mass panic and shooting could have happened. My condolences go out to the families of the victims.
In Gaza people are closer to dying than to living. More humanitarian aid needs to come in. Immediately.
We now finally need humanitarian action #Feuerpause (#ceasefire) so that the hostages are finally released from the hands of Hamas and more people don’t die in Gaza. And help can be distributed safely.
It has just gone 5pm in Gaza, Tel Aviv and Beirut, 6pm in Damascus. Here are the headlines …
Germany and France have joined widespread condemnation of the deaths of over 100 Palestinians yesterday while they were gathered to receive humanitarian aid in Gaza during an incident in which Israeli troops opened fire. Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock demanded Israel’s army “fully explain how the mass panic and shooting could have happened”, while her French counterpart, Stéphane Séjourné said “there will have to be an independent probe to determine what happened”. Earlier French president Emmanuel Macron said he felt “deep indignation at the images coming from Gaza where civilians have been targeted by Israeli soldiers.”
There were starkly different accounts of how victims died in the chaos on Thursday. Israel’s military denied shooting into large crowds of hungry people and said most were killed in a crush or run over by trucks trying to escape. Lebanon’s foreign ministry echoed the call for an investigation, condemning what it said was the “deliberate killing of dozens of defenseless Palestinian civilians and the wounding of hundreds” while in the US, the White House called the deaths “tremendously alarming”.
Brazil’s government said the killing shows that Israel’s military action in Gaza has no “ethical or legal limits”. Israel recently declared Brazil’s president Lula “persona non grata” and banned him from the country.
At least 30,228 Palestinians have been killed and 71,377 have been injured in Israel’s military offensive in Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement. The ministry gave the total casualties in the past 24 hours as 193 Palestinians killed and 920 injured, which included those killed or hurt in the aid convoy incident.
In its latest operational briefing, Israel’s military says it continues to operate in Khan Younis, where it claims to have “located a weapon storage facility containing numerous AK-47 rifles and ammunition”. It also claims to have targeted “a pit in which rocket launchers were concealed” and to have killed several fighters. The claims have not been independently verified.
Egypt’s foreign minister Sameh Shoukry said he is still hopeful that talks initiated by Qatar can agree a cessation of hostilities before the start of Ramadan.
A demonstration has taken place outside the US embassy in Tel Aviv calling for Joe Biden’s administration to do more to help free the 134 hostages still beleived held in Gaza by Hamas. A separate march calling for the release of the hostages has entered its third day. The march, featuring family and friends of those being held, is heading for Jerusalem.
Nearly 20,000 worshipers were able to reach the al-Aqsa mosque for Friday prayers despite significant restrictions on the entry of worshipers imposed by Israeli security forces. There were arrests, and some worshippers were denied entry and forced to pray outside the compound.
World Health Organization spokesperson Christian Lindmeier has said that the health system in Gaza is “more than on its knees”, and he also cautioned people not to forget that food supplies to the territory had been “cut off deliberately”. Jordan’s air force has been airdropping humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip today.
The EU has said it will resume funding the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine (UNRWA) next week, after the two parties came to an agreement to allow EU-appointed experts to audit the way it screens staff to identify extremists. Israel has accused 12 UNRWA employees of taking part in the Hamas attack inside Israel on 7 October. A month after the Israeli allegations, UN investigators have yet to receive any evidence from Israel to support the claims.
A member of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards navy serving as a military adviser in Syria was killed in a suspected strike by Israel on Friday. Israel also launched air raids over Lebanon.
More than 200 MPs from 12 countries have committed themselves to trying to persuade their governments to impose a ban on arms sales to Israel, arguing they will not be complicit in “Israel’s grave violation of international law” in its assault on Gaza.
In the UK, veteran political agitator George Galloway has been elected to parliament after running a byelection campaign in Rochdale chiefly about Gaza. He said established political parties in the UK “will pay a high price for the role that you have played in enabling, encouraging and covering for the catastrophe presently going on in occupied Gaza.”
We are pausing our live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East for now, and the live blog will be back tomorrow. Here is Harriet Sherwood’s latest report on events in the region …
Here are some further quotes from Egypt’s foreign minister Sameh Shoukry about the prospects for a peace deal.
Reuters reports he said:
I can say that we have reached a point of understanding, we will still exert every effort with our brothers in Qatar and the US and others close to the negotiations.
We will continue to strive in collaboration with the UN, with our partners to relieve the suffering of the Gazan people and to increase the level (of aid). Practically, this cannot happen without the cessation of hostilities.
Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Malki was speaking at the same panel at the event in Turkey, and he said Israel would not announce a ceasefire unless international pressure is imposed on Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. He said:
If we are not able to reach a ceasefire in the next two or three weeks, is clear we will see another round of attacks on Rafah and the continuation of a genocide.
Haaretz reports that Israeli settlers have established a new outpost near the Eli settlement in the northern occupied West Bank overnight. It comes a day after two Israelis were killed in a shooting attack at a gas station near the settlement.
Eli, which is to the south of Nablus and north of Ramallah, was founded in 1984 and has a population of about 4,400.
One of the victims of yesterday’s attack, 57-year-old Yitzhak Zeiger, was buried in Jerusalem earlier today.
Overnight the IDF issued a photo of it preparing the Qalandiya refugee camp home of Muhammad Manasra, who carried out the shooting, for demolition.
The EU has said it will resume funding the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine (UNRWA) next week, after the two parties came to an agreement to allow EU-appointed experts to audit the way it screens staff to identify extremists.
Israel has accused 12 UNRWA employees of taking part in the Hamas attack inside Israel on 7 October. A month after the Israeli allegations, UN investigators have yet to receive any evidence from Israel to support the claims though they expect some material to be forthcoming “shortly”.
The European Union said Friday that it will pay €50m (£42.8m / $54m) next week.It said that the agency has now “indicated that it stands ready to ensure that a review of its staff is carried out to confirm they did not participate in the attacks and that further controls are put in place to mitigate such risks in the future.”The commission said that two further tranches of funding worth €16m (£13.7m / $17.3m) each will be given to UNRWA as it complies with the agreement.AP reports UNRWA commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini welcomed the EU’s announcement and said that the commitment to provide money next week “comes at a critical time.”
The allegations against the 12 employees led 16 major donors to suspend contributions totalling $450m at a time when more than two million Gazans are facing famine.
Egypt’s foreign minister Sameh Shoukry said he is hopeful that talks initiated by Qatar can agree a cessation of hostilities in Gaza before the start of Ramadan.
Speaking at the Antalya diplomacy forum in Turkey, Reuters reports he said:
We are hopeful that we can reach a cessation of hostilities and exchange of hostages. Everyone recognises that we have a time limit to be successful before the start of Ramadan.
Ramadan is expected to begin on 10 March.
Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that the Islamic Waqf that administers the site in Jerusalem said nearly 20,000 worshipers were able to reach the al-Aqsa mosque despite significant restrictions on the entry of worshipers imposed by Israeli security forces.
There were arrests, and some people were forced to pray outside Lion’s Gate having been denied entry.
World Health Organization spokesperson Christian Lindmeier has said that the health system in Gaza is “more than on its knees”, and he also cautioned people not to forget that food supplies to the territory had been “cut off deliberately”.
In comments made to the media in Geneva, Reuters reports he said:
The system in Gaza is on its knees, it’s more than on its knees. All the lifelines in Gaza have more or less been cut. People are so desperate for food, for fresh water, for any supplies that they risk their lives in getting any food, any supplies to support their children, to support themselves. The food supplies have been cut off deliberately. Let’s not forget that.
A senior UN aid official told the UN security council on Tuesday that one quarter of the population of Gaza is one step away from famine, and widespread famine could be “almost inevitable” without action.
A member of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards navy serving as a military adviser in Syria was killed in a suspected Israeli strike on Friday, Reuters reports, citing Iran’s official news agency IRNA.
Other Iranian media reports said Reza Zarei was killed along with two fighters from Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah group.
Israel usually does not comment on repeated reports of raids on Syria.
State media in Lebanon is also reporting Israeli air raids, which it said targeted the southern Lebanese town of Aita al-Shaab, and also villages near the outskirts of Jabal Blat, all close to the UN-drawn blue line which separates Israel and Lebanon.
Images on the news wires show Palestinians mourning at the morgue of the Shuhada al-Aqsa after an overnight Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip.
India says the situation in Gaza remains “a concern”. Reuters reports in a statement the country’s foreign ministry said “Such loss of civilian lives and the larger humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to be a cause for extreme concern.”
President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has added her voice to those who have expressed concern over events in Gaza yesterday. She posted to social media to say:
Deeply disturbed by images from Gaza. Every effort must be made to investigate what happened and ensure transparency Humanitarian aid is a lifeline for those in need and access to it must be ensured. We stand by civilians, urging their protection in line with international law.

Trump Georgia case: judge says he hopes to have decision on whether to disqualify Fani Willis in two weeks – as it happened,2024-03-01,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/mar/01/trump-classified-documents-election-biden-latest-updates,"This live blog is now closed. You can read the full report on the Fani Willis hearing here.
A lawyer for one of Donald Trump’s co-defendants in the Georgia election interference case has argued that not removing Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney, would undermine public confidence in the legal system.
John Merchant, an attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman, argued that just “an appearance of a conflict of interest” between Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade would be “sufficient” to disqualify her from the election subversion case.
Merchant told Judge Scott McAfee that “if the court allows this kind of behavior to go on ... the entire public confidence in the system will be shot”, AP reported.
If the judge denies the bid to disqualify Willis, “there’s a good chance” an appeals court would overturn that ruling and order a new trial, Merchant argued, it writes.
Lawyers presented their closing arguments in a three-day evidentiary hearing to determine whether the district attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified from handling the election interference against Donald Trump because of her romantic relationship with a deputy handling the case.
Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the Georgia election interference case, indicated that he would rule within the next two weeks on whether to remove Willis from the case.
Joe Biden signed into law a short-term stopgap spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown. The bill was approved by the Senate on Thursday following a House vote that narrowly averted a shutdown that was due to occur this weekend.
A federal judge overseeing Donald Trump’s criminal case over his retention of classified documents appeared inclined to reject a proposal by special counsel prosecutors that she set a schedule culminating in a July trial. Trump himself attended the entirety of the hearing on Friday.
Prosecutors from special counsel Jack Smith’s office said holding Trump’s classified documents trial before the November presidential election would not violate the justice department’s policy against taking actions close to an election.
Joe Biden announced that the US will begin dropping food into Gaza by air “in the coming days” and consider making deliveries by sea. The news came after more than 100 Palestinians in Gaza were killed when desperate crowds gathered around aid trucks and Israeli troops opened fire on Thursday.
The Alaska Republican senator Lisa Murkowski has endorsed Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential primary, marking the first endorsement from a sitting senator for Haley.
Greg Abbott, the hard-right governor of Texas, is “absolutely” on Donald Trump’s short list for vice-president should Trump as expected win the Republican nomination to face Joe Biden.
A key question before Judge Scott McAfee is what standard he should use to determine if Fani Willis should be disqualified. Lawyers for the defense argued that the appearance of a conflict of interest was enough to disqualify Willis.
Adam Abbate, a lawyer in Willis’s office, said on Friday:
Not a single shred of evidence was produced through the exhibits or any testimony showing how their due process rights or constitutional rights were violated by the relationship that began in March 2022. There has been absolutely no evidence the district attorney has benefitted financially at all.
Adam Abbate, representing Willis, said that Georgia law was clear in saying an actual conflict had to exist. “They must show an actual conflict,” he said. Experts say state law has long established this high bar to clear and the defendants in the case have not done so, but McAfee seemed somewhat skeptical on Friday that the appearance of a conflict wouldn’t be enough.
A disqualification would upend the case and delay it past the 2024 election. The Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, a state agency, would have the sole discretion to reassign the case to another prosecutor, and there’s no timeline for how long that could take.
Pressed by McAfee, Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for Michael Roman, struggled to articulate what exactly Willis’s personal interest in the case was. “I think you know it when you see it,” he said.
Lawyers presented their closing arguments on Friday afternoon in a three-day evidentiary hearing to determine whether the district attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified from handling the election interference against Donald Trump because of her romantic relationship with a deputy handling the case.
The hearing was the coda to a dramatic deviation from the racketeering case against the former US president and 14 remaining co-defendants for trying to overturn the election in Georgia.
Willis sat at the counsel table in court on Friday for the latter half of the hearing, and Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the case, said he hoped to issue a decision on the matter in the next two weeks.
The matter kicked off in January when Michael Roman, a Republican operative and one of the defendants in the case, filed a motion claiming Willis financially benefitted from the case because of a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a top prosecutor in the case. Trump and several other defendants later joined the request.
Willis and Wade both admitted to a romantic relationship, but both said it only began after he was hired on 1 November 2021. They both testified about vacations they had taken together and revealed personal details about a romantic relationship that they say only began in 2022, after he was hired, and ended last summer.
The Republican senator for Alaska, Lisa Murkowski, has endorsed Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential primary, marking the first endorsement from a sitting senator for Haley.
“I’m proud to endorse Gov Nikki Haley,” Murkowski said in a statement.
America needs someone with the right values, vigor, and judgment to serve as our next President – and in this race, there is no one better than her.
The endorsement comes just days before Super Tuesday, when Alaska and several other states will cast their ballots.
Murkowski was among seven Republican senators who voted to convict Donald Trump for his alleged role in the January 6 insurrection.
In closing arguments in the hearing to determine whether the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, should be disqualified from handling the Trump election interference case, lawyers for the district attorney’s office argued that the defendants had failed to show any actual conflict of interest.
Adam Abbate, a lawyer with the district attorney’s office, accused the defendants’ attorneys of pushing “speculation and conjecture” and trying to harass and embarrass Willis with questions on the witness stand that have nothing to do with the issue at hand, AP reported.
“We have absolutely no evidence that Ms Willis received any financial gain or benefit” from the relationship, Abbate told the judge.

New: Judge McAfee says he hopes to have a resolution on motion to disqualify Fani Willis in Trump case in the next two weeks
It’s been a big day for two of Donald Trump’s most significant court cases. In the matter of the classified documents found in his possession at Mar-a-Lago, judge Aileen Cannon sounded skeptical of prosecutors’ request for a July trial, but did not set a new date. In the case alleging meddling in Georgia’s 2020 election, Trump’s attorneys argued for the removal of district attorney Fani Willis, saying failing to do so would undermine faith in the legal system. Willis is now in court as her office is expected to argue why it should remain on the case.
Here’s what else is going on today:
Joe Biden said the United States would airdrop aid into Gaza, and may also make deliveries by sea, while calling on Israel to facilitate access by land.
Trump said Texas’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, is a potential candidate to be his vice-president.
Nikki Haley campaigned in Virginia ahead of its primary next week, and was interrupted by protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Meanwhile, in Georgia, Fani Willis is back in the courtroom where a judge is considering whether to remove her from the election meddling case she brought against Donald Trump and 18 co-defendants:

Joe Biden’s vow to get humanitarian aid into Gaza by air and potentially sea comes after more than 100 people were killed amid a scramble to pick up food in the besieged territory, leading even some of Israel’s allies to demand an investigation. Here’s more on that, from the Guardian’s Harriet Sherwood, Emma Graham-Harrison and Julian Borger:
Israel is facing growing international pressure for an investigation after more than 100 Palestinians in Gaza were killed when desperate crowds gathered around aid trucks and Israeli troops opened fire on Thursday.
Israel said people died in a crush or were run over by aid lorries although it admitted its troops had opened fire on what it called a “mob”. But the head of a hospital in Gaza said 80% of injured people brought in had gunshot wounds.
The UK called for an “urgent investigation and accountability”. In a statement, David Cameron, the foreign secretary, said: “The deaths of people in Gaza waiting for an aid convoy were horrific … this must not happen again.” Israel must allow more aid into Gaza, Lord Cameron added.
France called for an independent investigation into the circumstances of the disaster, and Germany said the Israeli army must fully explain what happened. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said: “Every effort must be made to investigate what happened and ensure transparency.”
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 112 people were killed and more than 750 others were injured as crowds rushed towards a convoy of trucks carrying food aid.
The United States will work with Jordan to drop food into Gaza by air and will consider make deliveries by sea, Joe Biden said, while noting he will “insist” Israel allow more trucks bearing aid to enter the territory by land.
“In the coming days, we are going to join with our friends in Jordan and others in providing airdrops of additional food and supplies into [Gaza] and seek to continue to open up other avenues into [Gaza], including the possibility of a marine corridor to deliver large amounts of humanitarian assistance,” Biden said in the Oval Office. The president initially misspoke, saying the airdrops would be done in Ukraine rather than Gaza.
“In addition to expanding deliveries by land, as I said, we’re going to insist that Israel facilitate more trucks and more routes to get more and more people the help they need. No excuses, because the truth is aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough now – it’s nowhere nearly enough. Innocent lives are on the line and children’s lives are on the line.”
In a statement released just as Joe Biden announced the US would airdrop humanitarian aid into Gaza, the independent senator Bernie Sanders called on the president to approve such action – while also insisting the onus lay on Israel to help civilians.
“The United States, which has helped fund the Israeli military for years, cannot sit back and allow hundreds of thousands of innocent children to starve to death. As a result of Israeli bombing and restrictions on humanitarian aid, the people of Gaza are facing an unprecedented humanitarian disaster. Whether Netanyahu’s rightwing government likes it or not, the United States must immediately begin to airdrop food, water, and other lifesaving supplies into Gaza,” the progressive lawmaker from Vermont, who caucuses with the Democrats, wrote.
Here’s more:
But while an airdrop will buy time and save lives, there is no substitute for sustained ground deliveries of what is needed to sustain life in Gaza. Israel MUST open the borders and allow the United Nations to deliver supplies in sufficient quantities. The United States should make clear that failure to do so immediately will lead to a fundamental break in the U.S. – Israeli relationship and the immediate halt of all military aid.
The US will begin airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza, Joe Biden has said.
Biden said the airdrops will begin in the “coming days”, an announcement that came a day after more than 100 Palestinians in Gaza were killed when desperate crowds gathered around aid trucks and Israeli troops opened fire.
Donald Trump’s lawyer Steve Sadow has argued that Fani Willis should be disqualified from the election interference case because she may have lied to the court about her undisclosed affair with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.
Sadow said Willis’s claim under oath that her relationship with Wade did not begin until after she hired him was not credible, Reuters reports. He told the judge:
Once you have the appearance of impropriety ... the law in Georgia is clear: That’s enough to disqualify.
Joe Biden has signed into law a short-term stopgap spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown, the White House has said.
The bill was approved by the Senate on Thursday following a House vote that narrowly averted a shutdown that was due to occur this weekend.
The temporary extension funds the departments of agriculture, transportation, interior and others through 8 March. It funds the Pentagon, homeland security, health and state through 22 March.
A lawyer for one of Donald Trump’s co-defendants in the Georgia election interference case has argued that not removing Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney, would undermine public confidence in the legal system.
John Merchant, an attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman, argued that just “an appearance of a conflict of interest” between Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade would be “sufficient” to disqualify her from the election subversion case.
Merchant told Judge Scott McAfee that “if the court allows this kind of behavior to go on ... the entire public confidence in the system will be shot”, AP reported.
If the judge denies the bid to disqualify Willis, “there’s a good chance” an appeals court would overturn that ruling and order a new trial, Merchant argued, it writes.
Judge Scott McAfee has said he might be able to make a decision on the hearing on Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis as he hears closing arguments in the case. CNN quotes him as saying:
I think we’ve reached the point where I’d like to hear more of how the legal argument apply to what has already been presented, and it may already be possible for me to make a decision without those needing to be material to that decision.
Closing arguments began about half an hour ago over whether Willis should be disqualified from handling the election interference against Trump because of her romantic relationship with a deputy handling the case.

Middle East crisis live: UK-owned cargo ship sinks in Red Sea days after Houthi attack; US aircraft carry out airdrops of aid to Gaza – as it happened,2024-03-02,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/02/middle-east-crisis-israel-gaza-latest-news-updates-live,"Officials say a British-registered cargo ship hit in a missile attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels has sunk in the Red Sea. This blog is now closed.
Here is a wrap-up of the day’s key events:
A senior Houthi leader said that he is holding the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, responsible for the sinking of the UK-owned Rubymar after it was struck by Houthis earlier this week, Reuters reports. In a tweet, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of Yemen’s Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, said: “Sunak has a chance to recover the Rubymar by allowing aid trucks into Gaza.”
Israeli forces on Saturday struck tents housing displaced Palestinians near a hospital in Rafah, killing 11 people and wounding dozens, according to Gaza’s health officials. In a statement reported by Agence France-Presse, health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said that a paramedic was among those killed and that children were also wounded in the strikes, which occurred near the Emirati maternity hospital.
Israeli forces arrested 14 members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, the organization said on Saturday. In a tweet on Saturday, the PRCS said: “PRCS expresses deep concern for the safety of its detained teams, whose fate remains unknown, and calls on the international community to urgently intervene to pressure the Israeli occupation authorities to immediately release our detained colleagues.”
The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, will meet with Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz on Monday, a White House official told Reuters. The upcoming meeting is expected to cover topics including reducing Palestinian casualties, securing a temporary ceasefire, hostage release and an increase in aid flow.
US Central Command released a statement following its airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza, where Israel’s attacks across the strip have forced approximately 2 million Palestinians to the verge of famine. In a post on X, US Central Command announced that the operation was coordinated alongside the Royal Jordanian Air Force and involved the distribution of 38,000 meals.
A framework for a deal that would establish a six-week ceasefire in Gaza is in place with Israel’s agreement and is now dependent on Hamas, US administration official said on Saturday. “The hostages have to be released,” the official told reporters on a conference call. “The deal is basically there. But I don’t want to create expectations one way or the other.”

According to the US military, the ship was carrying more than 41,000 metric tons of fertilizer and caused an 18-mile oil slick after it was attacked.
Here are some images coming through the newswires of demonstrators who gathered around the world over the weekend to demand a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israeli forces have killed more than 30,000 Palestinians since 7 October.
Médecins Sans Frontières has issued a response to Saturday’s attack near a hospital in Rafah, in which Gaza health officials said Israeli strikes killed 11 Palestinians while wounding dozens more.
In several posts on X, the humanitarian organization said:
The Emirati hospital, supported by MSF, is the main primary maternity facility in southern Gaza. In recent weeks, patients have voiced their fear of entering the hospital due to systematic attacks in and around healthcare facilities across Gaza.
With 1.5 million people cramped into Rafah, any military escalation in the area would lead to catastrophic consequences. MSF reiterates its call for an immediate and sustained ceasefire and for the protection of civilians, healthcare facilities and staff.

Since 7 October, numerous human rights organizations have condemned Israel’s attacks on Gaza’s healthcare facilities, which have crippled the healthcare system across the strip.
In December, Tlaleng Mofokeng, the UN special rapporteur on the right to health, said that Israel has declared an “unrelenting war” on Gaza’s healthcare system.
Meanwhile, in November, Human Rights Watch said that Israel’s “repeated, apparently unlawful attacks on medical facilities, personnel, and transport are further destroying Gaza’s healthcare system and should be investigated as war crimes”.
Israeli forces on Saturday struck tents housing displaced Palestinians near a hospital in Rafah, killing 11 people and wounding dozens, according to Gaza’s health officials.
In a statement reported by Agence France-Presse, health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said that a paramedic was among those killed and that children were also wounded in the strikes which occurred near the Emirati maternity hospital.
“Eleven citizens were martyred and about 50 injured, including children, as a result of Israeli forces targeting tents of displaced people near the Emirati hospital,” Qudra said.
Speaking to AFP, Rafah resident Belal Abu Jekhleh said: “Destruction is everywhere and there are many martyrs … Suddenly the glass shattered and a fire broke out. Everyone fled, some were martyred and others injured. I was injured in my hands and head, and my brother was also injured.”
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), World Health Organization chief Tedros Ghebreyesus called the attacks “outrageous and unspeakable,” adding: “Health workers and civilians are #NotATarget, and must be protected at all times.”
He went on to urge Israel, whose forces have killed more than 30,000 Palelstinians while injuring more than 60,000 others since 7 October, to cease fire.
Reports that tents sheltering displaced people in Rafah were bombed - reportedly killing 11 people and injuring 50, including children - are outrageous and unspeakable. Among those killed are two health workers. Health workers and civilians are #NotATarget, and must be…
The upcoming meeting between the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz on Monday is expected to cover topics including reducing Palestinian casualties, securing a temporary ceasefire, hostage release and increasing aid flow, Reuters reports.
“The vice president will express her concern over the safety of the as many as 1.5 million people in Rafah,” a US official told Reuters, adding that Israel also had a “right to defend itself in the face of continued Hamas terrorist threats”.
Meanwhile, a statement from Gantz’s office said that in addition to Harris, Gantz will meet with US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, along with Democratic and Republican congressional members.
“Minister Gantz personally updated the prime minister on his own initiative on Friday of his intention to travel, in order to coordinate the messages to be transmitted in the meetings,” the statement said.
Since 7 October, Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians while leaving approximately 2 million survivors forcibly displaced across the narrow strip.
Here are some images coming through the newswires from Gaza, where Israeli forces have killed more than 30,000 Palestinians since 7 October while leaving approximately 2 million survivors grappling with shortages in food, water, fuel and medical supplies:
Airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza might not be necessary if Israel faced more pressure from western countries on aid entry, the Guardian’s Patrick Wintour writes:
Melanie Ward, the chief executive of Medical Aid for Palestinians, said: “Instead of dropping packages from the sky – some of which end up in the sea or outside of Gaza and which the most vulnerable cannot reach in any case – the US, the UK and others should ensure that Israel immediately opens all crossings into Gaza for aid and aid workers to assist those in need. This includes the Karni and Erez crossings, which give direct access to the north of Gaza. Only safe and unfettered access for aid and aid workers, the lifting of the siege and an immediate ceasefire can end starvation in Gaza.”
The distribution of aid once it hits the ground is also a concern of the UN Relief and Works Agency. Civil order is breaking down in northern Gaza and it is just as likely that Hamas will end up being the distributor and chief consumer of the aid, thereby reinforcing its authority.
Chris Doyle, the director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, saw a political message in the White House decision. He said: “When the US, the world’s greatest military power and the greatest ally of Israel, is reduced to operating air aid drops, it is a sign of America’s ineffectiveness.”

The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, will meet with Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz on Monday, a White House official told Reuters.
Reuters adds that the meeting is set to take place at the White House.
A framework for a deal that would establish a six-week ceasefire in Gaza is in place with Israel’s agreement and is now dependent on Hamas, Reuters reports a US administration official saying on Saturday.
“The hostages have to be released,” the official told reporters on a conference call. “The deal is basically there. But I don’t want to create expectations one way or the other.”
Reports of the potential deal come as Israeli forces have killed more than 30,000 Palestinians since 7 October while leaving approximately 2 million survivors forcibly displaced across the Gaza Strip.
US Central Command has released a statement following its airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza, where Israel’s attacks across the strip have forced approximately 2 million Palestinians to the verge of famine.
In a post on X, US Central Command announced that the operation was coordinated alongside the Royal Jordanian Air Force and involved the distribution of 38,000 meals.
These airdrops are part of a sustained effort to get more aid into Gaza, including by expanding the flow of aid through land corridors and routes.

As one of the chief exporters of arms to Israel, the US has provided the country with more than 70,000 weapons – including missiles and bombs – since 1950.
It is has gone 6.20pm in Gaza, Tel Aviv and Beirut, and 7.50pm in Tehran. Here is a recap of the latest developments from today:
World leaders have called for an investigation and a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war after at least 104 people were reported killed among a crowd of Palestinians gathered to receive humanitarian aid in Gaza City. There were conflicting reports about events leading up to the deaths. A UN team that visited some of the wounded in al-Shifa hospital on Friday saw a “large number of gunshot wounds”, a spokesperson for the UN chief, António Guterres, said.
The EU’s diplomatic service also urged an international investigation. Many of the Palestinians killed or injured in the chaos as they tried to get bags of flour from an aid convoy were hit by Israeli army fire, said the European External Action Service on Saturday.
French president Emmanuel Macron said on Friday he was angered by the images “coming from Gaza where civilians have been targeted by Israeli soldiers”. On X, he strongly condemned the shootings and called for “truth, justice, and respect for international law”.
African Union chief Moussa Faki Mahamat on Saturday strongly condemned “the mass killing of Palestinians queueing for humanitarian aid” and urged an international probe.
US military C-130 cargo planes on Saturday dropped food in pallets, containing about 38,000 meals, into Gaza. US president, Joe Biden had announced on Friday that the US would soon start airdropping aid to Gaza, a day after dozens of desperate Palestinians were killed rushing an aid convoy.
Gaza ceasefire negotiations are due to resume in Cairo on Sunday, Reuters reported citing Egyptian security sources. Additionally, a source close to Hamas told AFP that a delegation was expected to fly to Cairo on Saturday for talks on a truce in Gaza.
More than 200 MPs from 12 countries have committed themselves to trying to persuade their governments to impose a ban on arms sales to Israel, arguing they will not be complicit in “Israel’s grave violation of international law” in its assault on Gaza.
A tenth child in a Gaza hospital has been registered as having died from starvation, said the UN on Friday, warning that the “real figure is likely to be higher”. “The official records yesterday or this morning said there was a tenth child officially registered in a hospital as having starved to death,” said UN health agency spokesperson Christian Lindmeier. “A very sad threshold …[but] the unofficial numbers can unfortunately be expected to be higher,” he added.
At least 11 Palestinians were killed by an Israeli airstrike on Saturday that hit a tent in Rafah, the Gaza health ministry said. The airstrike took place over an area where displaced Palestinians have been taking shelter, outside the Emirate hospital in the suburb of Tel Al-Sultan of southern Gaza’s Rafah. The Hamas-run health ministry said another 50 people were injured in the strike and that one of the dead was a medic at the hospital. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment, said Reuters.
The Israeli military said its forces killed eight militants in Khan Younis, about 20 militants in the central Gaza Strip and three more in Rimal, near Gaza City.
The Palestinian Authority hopes a ceasefire can be agreed in Gaza in time for Ramadan, its foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, said on Saturday. Speaking at a news conference at a diplomatic forum in Antalya, Tukrey, Maliki said the Palestinian Authority would be “the only legitimate authority” to run Gaza after the war.
Biden, said on Friday he was “hoping” for a ceasefire deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict by the Muslim holy month of Ramadan but agreement was still not sealed.
Also on Friday, Biden said the US would begin airdropping humanitarian assistance into “Ukraine” when he meant Gaza. The president twice referred to airdrops to help Ukraine, but White House officials clarified he was referring to Gaza.
92 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes and 156 were injured in the past 24 hours, according to the latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.
An Israeli drone strike killed three Hezbollah fighters in south Lebanon on Saturday. The men were killed when the car they were in was targeted on a coastal road near the town of Naqoura, security sources in Lebanon told Reuters.
In response to reports about the drone strike that killed three Hezbollah fighters in south Lebanon on Saturday, the Israeli army said one of its aircraft had struck a vehicle in south Lebanon transporting “a number of terrorists who launched rockets into Israeli territory”. It also said its jets struck “Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure” in the Labbouneh area at the Israeli border on Saturday, in addition to two Hezbollah military compounds hit overnight in another frontier area.
Hezbollah said it carried out an attack on an Israeli military headquarters in the village of Liman using an explosive drone at 5.40am (3.40am GMT) on Saturday, reporting a direct hit.
Officials say Rubymar, a British-registered cargo ship, attacked by Yemen’s Houthi rebels has sunk in the Red Sea after days of taking on water. It marks the first ship sunk by the Houthis amid their months-long attacks on shipping in the vital waterway.
Pro-Palestine protests took place across the UK on Saturday after the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak warned that democracy was being targeted by “extremists”. In an address to the nation on Friday, the prime minister spoke about “forces here at home trying to tear us apart”, in the aftermath of the 7 October attacks by Hamas against Israel.
A month after Israeli allegations that a dozen United Nations staff were involved in the 7 October Hamas attack, UN investigators have yet to receive any evidence from Israel to support the claims, though they expect some material to be forthcoming “shortly”. The allegations against the 12 employees of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine (UNRWA) led 16 major donors to suspend contributions totalling $450m (£356m).
Polling closed in Iran’s parliamentary elections on Friday night, with officials claiming the nationwide turnout was a record low of 40.6%. After 10 hours of voting, turnout had stood at only 27%, and in Tehran it was just 12% after eight hours, before the polls were unexpectedly kept open for an extra two hours.
An Iranian pop singer whose song became an anthem during mass protests more than a year ago has been sentenced to at least three years in prison. Shervin Hajipour, 26, wrote and published Baraye during nationwide demonstrations triggered by Mahsa Amini’s death in custody in September 2022.
As Israelis are called up to join the war effort in Gaza, anger is mounting at the ultra-Orthodox community which has long been spared the compulsory military service required of most citizens. Since the 7 October attack by Hamas, the question surrounding whether the insular community, whose members see army service as conflicting with their religious duties, should be obliged to serve has sparked debate and led to protests against their decades-long exemptions.
According to the Times of Israel, war cabinet minister Benny Gantz, who is head of the National Unity party, is to travel to Washington on Sunday on a trip that is believed to have not been coordinated with Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Citing the Israeli news website, Ynet, the Times of Israel said the report had left Netanyahu “fuming”.
A Hamas delegation was expected to fly to Cairo on Saturday for talks on a truce in Gaza, a source close to the group told AFP.
Egyptian, Qatari and US go-betweens have been shuttling between Israeli and Hamas negotiators, trying to secure a pause in fighting before the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan, which begins on 10 or 11 March, depending on the lunar calendar.
Both Washington and Doha had voiced hope a ceasefire could go into effect as early as next week but US president Joe Biden said on Thursday that a deal would take longer after more than 100 Palestinian civilians were killed rushing an aid convoy in the Gaza Strip.
The Hamas delegation will “meet with Egyptians overseeing the ceasefire negotiations, to follow up on the negotiation developments that aim to stop the offensive and the war, and to reach a hostage exchange deal,” said the source close to Hamas, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.
According to AFP, the source said the delegation would submit Hamas’s “official answer” to a proposal thrashed out with Israeli negotiators in Paris late last month.
A Hamas source told AFP earlier this week that under the proposal, a truce would last for six weeks, with Hamas releasing 42 hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
On Thursday, the White House said the hostage release “would result in an immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza over a period of at least six weeks”.
The only previous truce in the war lasted for one week in late November.
In addition to halting Israel’s offensive, Hamas wants new truce terms to ensure immediate humanitarian relief for Palestinians, an Israeli withdrawal and the return of Palestinians displaced from the north, said the source close to the group.
Here are some images from the newswires showing pro-Palestine protests in London and Dorset on Saturday.
The protests follow UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak’s warning on Friday that demonstrations and democracy itself were being targeted by extremists.

Cameron describes talks with Israeli minister over Gaza as ‘tough but necessary’,2024-03-06,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/06/uk-patience-with-israel-wearing-thin-over-gaza-aid-cameron-to-tell-gantz,"UK foreign secretary repeated request to Benny Gantz for Israel to allow delivery of more aid and refrain from a full-scale assault on Rafah
The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, has said he had held a “tough but necessary” conversation with Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz, repeating calls for more humanitarian aid for Gaza and warning him against a fully fledged offensive in Rafah.
Cameron said ensuring the availability of aid in Gaza would be a factor when the UK assesses whether Israel is acting in line with international law.
Gantz, a former defence minister and domestic political rival of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has caused a furore at home by going to both Washington and London independently to speak to their most senior figures about the future of the war. Netanyahu instructed the British embassy to afford him no help or security detail on his visits.
After the meeting, Cameron issued a statement: “Palestinians are facing a devastating and growing humanitarian crisis. In my meeting with Israeli minister Benny Gantz today, we discussed efforts to secure a humanitarian pause to get the hostages safely home and life-saving supplies into Gaza.
“I once again pressed Israel to increase the flow of aid. We are still not seeing improvements on the ground. This must change.”
Cameron spelled out the UK’s call for an immediate humanitarian pause in the fighting, increased capacity for aid distribution within Gaza and greater access for supplies through both land and maritime routes.
He also called for a wider variety of aid items to be allowed into Gaza, including shelters and items essential to repair the infrastructure destroyed during the Israeli military campaign.
Repeating remarks he made in the Lords on Tuesday, he said: “The UK supports Israel’s right to self-defence. But as the occupying power in Gaza, Israel has a legal responsibility to ensure aid is available for civilians.
“That responsibility has consequences, including when we as the UK assess whether Israel is compliant with international humanitarian law.”
He stressed that the UK was “deeply concerned” about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah, the city in southern Gaza close to the border with Egypt that is providing shelter to more than a million people displaced by the violence.
Gantz is described as a centrist in Israeli politics but he is totally committed to the elimination of Hamas as a military force, including, if necessary, mounting a full-scale offensive in Rafah in southern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are densely crowded.
The UK remains opposed to an assault on Rafah, since it cannot envisage how tens of thousands can be moved elsewhere in Gaza. The fear is that Rafah becomes a battleground in which Hamas makes a last stand as Israel bids to extract the remaining hostages held by militants, assuming the terms of a ceasefire are not agreed.
But Gantz is regarded as a more trustworthy constructive partner who, unlike Netanyahu, is not beholden to the far right and settler movement. He is also seen as more likely to engage in the medium term with a revamped Palestinian leadership and to hold sensible discussions on the future governance of Gaza. Netanyahu, by contrast, has said Israel will maintain security in Gaza for a decade.
The US administration also senses that Netanyahu is burning his bridges with the Biden administration, confident that Donald Trump will be elected.
It has been a form of humiliation for Biden that despite his support for Israel, which has come at high political cost, he has been reduced to airdropping aid to those desperate for food and water.

Malaysian PM calls on Albanese to reinstate UNRWA funding to aid ‘besieged civilians’ of Gaza,2024-03-07,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/07/anwar-ibrahim-albanese-reinstate-unrwa-funding-aid-besieged-civilians-gaza,"Difference between the west’s responses to human suffering in Ukraine and Palestine defies reasoning, Anwar Ibrahim says
The Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, says he has appealed directly to his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, to reinstate funding to UNRWA, arguing the aid agency was the most effective channel to “help the besieged civilians” of Gaza.

Addressing the Australian National University in Canberra on Thursday, Anwar said countries should not apply international law selectively.
“Unfortunately, the gut-wrenching tragedy that continues to unfold in the Gaza Strip has laid bare the self-serving nature of the much-vaunted rules-based order,” Anwar said.
“The differing responses by the west to human suffering defy reasoning.”
Anwar questioned why the west had been “so vociferous, vehement and unequivocal in the condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while remaining utterly silent on the relentless blood-letting inflicted on innocent men, women and children of Gaza”.
“Sure, there are exceptions, but they are few and far between,” he said as he delivered the 2024 Gareth Evans Oration, named after a long-serving former foreign minister.
Anwar said some countries had labelled as “counterproductive” the proceedings initiated by South Africa at the International Court of Justice alleging Israel had breached the genocide convention. Israel has repeatedly denied claims of genocide levelled against it.
“But what could be more consistent with any reasonable conception of a rules-based order, than an appeal to those values before a panel of 17 judges?”
Anwar said it would foolish to think these inconsistencies would “go unnoticed”.
Asked later whether he included Australia in his critique of western responses, Anwar said he gave “credit to Australia, New Zealand and Canada, because they have somewhat shifted from the original stance and called for a ceasefire and humanitarian assistance”.
Those three countries voted in December for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the release of hostages. They also issued a joint statement in February warning Israel against a “catastrophic” ground offensive in Rafah in southern Gaza.
Israel states that its legitimate aim is to “destroy” Hamas and to rescue more than 100 hostages that remain in captivity in Gaza after the militant group’s 7 October attack on southern Israel.
But Anwar said the conflict had a longer history. He said Palestinians had suffered since the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, when hundreds of thousands of people were expelled or fled from their homeland after the creation of the state of Israel.
“But at least stop, for goodness sakes – stop the killings of children, women and civilians. And now I think Australia is onboard consistently calling for this.”

Anwar said he had urged Albanese – during a meeting in Melbourne on Monday – to fund UNRWA at the same time as investigations continued into allegations from Israel that 12 of the organisation’s staff members were involved in the 7 October attack.
“[Albanese] was very attentive, very polite, as most good politicians [are] … and allowed me to present my case very strongly on the issue of Gaza,” he said.
Amid reports Canada may soon reinstate funding to UNRWA, Albanese told reporters on Wednesday that Australia would “make an assessment at an appropriate time” about providing about $6m in top-up funding that was frozen in late January.
The Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, who was born in Malaysia, warmly welcomed Anwar to the ANU stage on Thursday.
“Prime Minister, as a proud Sabahan-Australian, it is a singular honour for me to introduce you today,” she said.
Wong said it was “important for us to continue to use our voices to advocate for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and humanitarian access, the release of hostages, and for the protection of civilians”.
Wong called for “an enduring peace with an independent Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel”. Unlike Australia, Malaysia does not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel.
Wong also spoke about the spillover impacts of the conflict on social cohesion: “Regrettably, here in Australia, we see people who claim to champion human rights and justice behaving in ways that show little regard for either.”
Wong said there had also been “shocking attempts at intimidation and character assassination” and “blatant antisemitism and Islamophobia” but Australia must remain “a pluralist country”.

First Thing: Gaza hunger grows as pressure builds on Israel to facilitate aid,2024-03-07,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/07/first-thing-gaza-hunger-grows-as-pressure-builds-on-israel-to-facilitate-aid,"UN warns widespread famine in Gaza ‘almost inevitable’ without action. Plus, Russian missiles strike near Zelenskiy in Odesa
Good morning,
As Israel’s war on Gaza entered its sixth month, international pressure continued to build on Israel to facilitate humanitarian aid delivery amid soaring hunger that the UN says will almost inevitably cause widespread famine without a change in the blockade.
The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, said he held a “tough but necessary” conversation with the Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz on Wednesday, repeating calls for more humanitarian aid for Gaza and warning him against a fully fledged offensive in Rafah.
“As the occupying power in Gaza, Israel has a legal responsibility to ensure aid is available for civilians,” Cameron said on Tuesday. “That responsibility has consequences, including when we as the UK assess whether Israel is compliant with international humanitarian law.”
Pressure also came from China, whose foreign minister, Wang Yi, said on Thursday: “The international community must act urgently, making an immediate ceasefire and the cessation of hostilities an overriding priority, and ensuring humanitarian relief an urgent moral responsibility.” And the Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, criticised the west for its attitude to the “gut-wrenching tragedy” in Gaza.
The US is reported to have made more than 100 weapons sales to Israel, including thousands of bombs, since the start of the war. Meanwhile, the US still says a ceasefire deal “can be reached”, with next week’s start to Ramadan approaching.
Here’s the situation with hunger and starvation in Gaza: the UN’s World Food Programme has said hunger has reached “catastrophic levels” in northern Gaza. Gaza health officials say 20 people have died from malnutrition and dehydration, at least half of them children.
Here’s what we know about the impact of war: at least 30,800 Palestinians have been killed and 72,298 have been wounded since Israel began its military assault, Gaza’s health ministry said, including 83 killed in the last 24 hours. Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel killed 1,200 people and another 200 were taken hostage.
Joe Biden will deliver the final State of the Union address of his presidential term on Thursday evening, giving the incumbent Democrat an opportunity to tout the administration’s accomplishments and pitch his re-election campaign as he prepares for a rematch against Donald Trump in November.
Domestically, although the rate of inflation has eased and unemployment is at a record low, only 27% of Americans rate the country’s economic conditions as excellent or good, according to a Gallup poll conducted in January.
In foreign policy, Biden has struggled to convince Congress approve more funding for Ukraine in its war with Russia, and the vice-president Kamala Harris’s recent call for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza does not appear to have moved the needle in negotiations between Israel and Hamas.
A YouGov/Economist poll conducted 3-5 March found Trump on 44% and Biden on 42%.
Here’s what Biden will be hoping to address: more than three-quarters (76%) of US voters say they have concerns about Biden, 81, not having the necessary mental and physical health for a second presidential term, according to an NBC News poll conducted in January, while 48% said the same of 77-year-old Trump.
Here’s what else Biden will highlight: US support for abortion access has neared record highs, even as dozens of Republican-led states have enacted severe restrictions on the procedure since the overturning of Roe v Wade. Jill Biden has invited as a guest to the speech Kate Cox, who made headlines in December when she fled Texas to receive abortion care after she was denied access to the procedure in her home state.
Here’s what’s happening on the Republican side: Nikki Haley said she had “no regrets” about ending her presidential campaign on Wednesday, in effect ceding the 2024 Republican nomination to Trump. But, in her last card to play, Haley has not yet endorsed him. Almost 570,000 voters in three key battleground states – Nevada, North Carolina and Michigan – voted for Haley in the primaries, teeing up a battle between Trump and Biden to appeal to her supporters.
An “intense” Russian missile bombardment appeared to land near Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the visiting Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, in an attack that killed five people, according to Ukraine’s navy.
It came as Ukraine stepped up its own attacks behind Russian lines with the apparent car-bomb killing of a Russian election official on Wednesday and a drone assault on a metal plant, according to AFP.
Mitsotakis said in Odesa: “We heard the sound of sirens and explosions that took place near us. We did not have time to get to a shelter. It is a very intense experience.”
Meanwhile, Russian sabre-rattling continued as a Russian military officer warned that the conflict in Ukraine could escalate into a full-scale war in Europe, state news reported. On Thursday Sweden was due to become Nato’s 32nd member.
Here’s the news from the war’s frontline: the Ukrainian military said on Wednesday that Russian forces were unable to gain new ground near Avdiivka, near Donetsk. The Russians were instead focusing on an area to the south, near the village of Novomykhailivka.
Here’s the latest on war funding: UK and German foreign ministers meet on Thursday to discuss further aid. The UK said it is prepared to loan Ukraine all frozen Russian central bank assets in the UK, on the basis that Russia will be forced to pay reparations to Ukraine at the end of the war.

Last month was the warmest February on record globally, scientists have said. February was 1.77C warmer than the pre-industrial average for the month and 0.81C above the 1991-2020 average. The global average temperature for the past 12 months was the highest on record, at 1.56C above pre-industrial levels. That puts the world temporarily above the 1.5C threshold beyond which, over the long term, the worst impacts of climate change are expected.
As David Runciman asks in this long read, are we suffering from political long Covid? When the pandemic hit, its effects on politics were intensely felt and hard to predict. In some ways, it seemed like the ultimate stress test. Different political systems – and leaders – were exposed in different ways. Those with longstanding vulnerabilities seemed destined to fail. But four years on, it is also clear that many of the lasting political consequences of the virus have little to do with the relative performance of individual governments.

Middle East crisis: UN’s expert on torture investigating claims Palestinian detainees were mistreated in Israel – as it happened,2024-03-08,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/08/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-israel-gaza-palestine-hamas-war-state-of-the-union-biden,"UN special rapporteur on torture to carry out fact-finding investigation after receiving allegations detained Palestinians were mistreated
The UN’s expert on torture said on Friday she was investigating allegations of torture and mistreatment of Palestinian detainees in Israel, and was in talks to visit the country, reports Reuters.
Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the UN human rights council in Geneva, Dr Alice Jill Edwards said she had recently received allegations of torture and ill-treatment of Palestinians being detained in the Israeli-occupied West Bank or as a result of the conflict in Gaza, where Israel is fighting the ruling Palestinian Hamas movement.
“I’m looking into that as we speak and carrying out a fact-finding investigation,” said Edwards, the UN special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
“I’m calling on … Hamas, the state of Palestine, Israel to put their torture tools down, to really have a focus on peace and a prospect of living side-by-side as neighbours in the future,” she told Reuters.
Reuters said there was no immediate comment from the Israeli diplomatic mission in Geneva.
The UN human rights office says it has received numerous reports of mass detention, ill-treatment and enforced disappearance of Palestinians in northern Gaza by the Israeli military, and has recorded the arrests of thousands in the West Bank.
Edwards said she had also raised allegations of mass murders and mutilations of hostages and sexual violence against them with Palestinian authorities through the Palestinian Permanent Mission in Geneva.
She said she had, however, received “a disappointing reply” that “showed no empathy for those individuals who were subject to terrible atrocities on 7 October”. The mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters.
It has gone 5pm in Gaza and Tel Aviv. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Middle East coverage here.
Here is a recap of the latest developments from today:
The European Commission, Cyprus, the UAE, UK and US put out a joint statement on what it described as the activation of a maritime corridor to deliver humanitarian assistance to Gaza. “This maritime corridor can – and must – be part of a sustained effort to increase the flow of humanitarian aid and commercial commodities into Gaza through all possible routes,” it added.
It is believed that the maiden aid voyage will be made by Spain’s Open Arms in what will be a test voyage of the sea corridor. The vessel had been waiting at Cyprus’s port of Larnaca for permission to deliver food aid from World Central Kitchen, a US charity founded by celebrity chef José André.
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she expected the maritime aid corridor to start operating between Cyprus and Gaza over this weekend, taking desperately needed aid to besieged Palestinians. Von der Leyen said a pilot test run of food aid collected by a charity group and supported by the UAE could be leaving Cyprus as early as Friday from the port of Larnaca.
Von der Leyen held talks with the president of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides, on Friday. The EU chief travelled to Larnaca to inspect the command centre and port facilities that will be used.
US forces will build a temporary dock on the Gaza shoreline to allow delivery of humanitarian aid on a large scale, president Joe Biden announced in his State of the Union speech, amid warnings of a widespread famine among the territory’s 2.3 million Palestinians. He promised “no US boots will be on the ground”, and said: “This temporary pier would enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day.”
Biden also warned Israel that it cannot use aid as a “bargaining chip” as he issued a call for an immediate, temporary ceasefire with Hamas. “To the leadership of Israel I say this – humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority,” Biden said in his annual State of the Union address.
Sigrid Kaag, the UN senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told reporters late on Thursday that air and sea deliveries cannot make up for a shortage of supply routes on land. Kaag said that while airdrops represented a “symbol of support for civilians in Gaza” and were “a testament to our shared humanity”, they were “a drop in the ocean”. “It’s far from enough,” she added.
Aid groups have welcomed Biden’s announcement of relief finally reaching the war-ravaged coastal strip. But there are also fears that with needs now so desperate any shipment will be “a drop in the bucket.” Reacting to the news Mercy Corps’ vice-president of global policy and advocacy, Kate Phillips-Barrasso said that while “any effort to get more aid into Gaza is needed and welcome” any ‘sea aid’ would be “a drop in the bucket in terms of the volume and range of relief Palestinians need right now.”
The UK foreign secretary David Cameron said on Friday that the US-led plan to build a temporary harbour in Gaza to bring in aid would take time, reiterating his call for Israel to open the port of Ashdod in the meantime. He said it was “crucial” for the Israelis to “confirm that they’ll open the port”. Cameron also urged Israel to allow more aid trucks into Gaza.
The UN’s expert on torture said on Friday she was investigating allegations of torture and mistreatment of Palestinian detainees in Israel, and was in talks to visit the country. Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the UN human rights council in Geneva, Dr Alice Jill Edwards said she had recently received allegations of torture and ill-treatment of Palestinians being detained in the Israeli-occupied West Bank or as a result of the conflict in Gaza.
Edwards said she had also raised allegations of mass murders and mutilations of hostages and sexual violence against them with Palestinian authorities through the Palestinian Permanent Mission in Geneva. She said she had, however, received “a disappointing reply” that “showed no empathy for those individuals who were subject to terrible atrocities on 7 October”. The mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters.
Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories have expanded by a record amount and risk eliminating any practical possibly of a Palestinian state, the UN human rights chief said on Friday. The UN’s high commissioner for human rights Volker Türk said that the growth of Israeli settlements amounted to the transfer by Israel of its own population, which he said was a war crime.
At least 30,878 Palestinians have been killed and 72,402 have been injured since 7 October in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry said in a statement on Friday.
“On average, 63 women are killed in Gaza per day” said the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in a social media post for International Women’s Day. According to UNRWA, at least 9,000 women have been killed in Gaza since early October, but the UN agency warned the number is likely higher due to the many more reported to be dead under the rubble.
Israel will not give in to international pressure to stall an attack on the southern Gaza city of Rafah and will continue its bloody offensive against Hamas, said Benjamin Netanyahu. “There is international pressure and it’s growing, but … we need to stand together against the attempts to stop the war,” the prime minister told a military graduation ceremony in southern Israel.
Israel’s army said on Friday its initial probe into an incident that the Palestinian health authorities said left more than 100 Palestinians dead as crowds rushed an aid convoy, found troops “fired precisely” at approaching suspects. Releasing its initial findings on Friday, the military said in a statement that the “command review” found that “troops did not fire at the humanitarian convoy”. It added, however, that they “did fire at a number of suspects who approached the nearby forces and posed a threat to them”.
UK support for the marine aid corridor to Gaza has involved assistance with planning and surveying, Downing Street said. A Number 10 spokesperson said: “We have supported the US in planning for the pontoon, including by sending marine surveyors and will now be working with partners to operationalise our maritime aid corridor from Cyprus.” The UK’s foreign secretary David Cameron said on Friday: “Alongside the US, the UK and partners have announced we will open a maritime corridor to deliver aid directly to Gaza”.
The UN’s human rights office said on Friday that an Israeli offensive in Gaza’s border town of Rafah could not be allowed to happen because it would cause massive loss of life. “Any ground assault on Rafah would incur massive loss of life and would heighten the risk of further atrocity crimes,” said Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for the UN human rights office.
A Hamas official told AFP that ceasefire negotiations were not over, on Friday. “The mediators informed Hamas that efforts will continue to reach an agreement,” the official told AFP, requesting not to be named as he was not authorised to speak on the matter. Israeli war cabinet member Gadi Eisenkot said Hamas was under “very serious pressure” from mediators to make a “counter-offer”.
British maritime agencies said on Friday an incident had been reported in waters about 50 nautical miles south-east of Yemen’s city of Aden where Houthi militants have been attacking ships.
Two civilians were killed in a Turkish airstrike in the mountainous Sheladiz area in northern Iraq’s Duhok province, two security sources said on Friday.
Reuters reports that British maritime agencies said on Friday an incident had been reported in waters about 50 nautical miles south-east of Yemen’s city of Aden where Houthi militants have been attacking ships.
The Iran-backed group has launched drone and missile attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandab strait and Gulf of Aden since November. They say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians over the war in Gaza.
The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said that the authorities are investigating the incident while security firm Ambrey said it is aware of an incident nearly 52 nautical miles south of Aden and is also investigating.

The UK foreign secretary David Cameron said on Friday that the US-led plan to build a temporary harbour in Gaza to bring in aid would take time, reiterating his call for Israel to open the port of Ashdod in the meantime, reports Reuters.
“It’s going to take time to build,” Cameron told UK broadcasters of the harbour. “So the crucial thing is today the Israelis must confirm that they’ll open the port at Ashdod.”
The UN’s expert on torture said on Friday she was investigating allegations of torture and mistreatment of Palestinian detainees in Israel, and was in talks to visit the country, reports Reuters.
Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the UN human rights council in Geneva, Dr Alice Jill Edwards said she had recently received allegations of torture and ill-treatment of Palestinians being detained in the Israeli-occupied West Bank or as a result of the conflict in Gaza, where Israel is fighting the ruling Palestinian Hamas movement.
“I’m looking into that as we speak and carrying out a fact-finding investigation,” said Edwards, the UN special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
“I’m calling on … Hamas, the state of Palestine, Israel to put their torture tools down, to really have a focus on peace and a prospect of living side-by-side as neighbours in the future,” she told Reuters.
Reuters said there was no immediate comment from the Israeli diplomatic mission in Geneva.
The UN human rights office says it has received numerous reports of mass detention, ill-treatment and enforced disappearance of Palestinians in northern Gaza by the Israeli military, and has recorded the arrests of thousands in the West Bank.
Edwards said she had also raised allegations of mass murders and mutilations of hostages and sexual violence against them with Palestinian authorities through the Palestinian Permanent Mission in Geneva.
She said she had, however, received “a disappointing reply” that “showed no empathy for those individuals who were subject to terrible atrocities on 7 October”. The mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters.
We now have the statement endorsing what it describes as the activation of a maritime corridor to deliver humanitarian assistance to Gaza. The statement has been put out jointly by the European Commission, Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates, the UK and the United States:
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire, with innocent Palestinian families and children desperate for basic necessities. That is why today, the European Commission, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the US announce our intent to open a maritime corridor to deliver much-needed additional amounts of humanitarian assistance by sea.
Cyprus’s leadership in establishing the Amalthea Initiative-which outlines a mechanism for securely shipping aid from Cyprus to Gaza via sea-was integral to enabling this joint effort to launch a maritime corridor. Together, our nations intend to build on this model to deliver significant additional aid by sea, working in coordination with UN senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag – who is charged with facilitating, coordinating, monitoring, and verifying the flow of aid into Gaza under UN security council resolution 2720. The dedicated efforts of the UAE to mobilise support for the Initiative will result in the initial shipment of food by sea to the people of Gaza.”
Cyprus, it continued, “will soon convene senior officials to discuss how we can accelerate this maritime channel supporting those in need, supplementing land and air routes, including from Egypt and Jordan.
The US announced an emergency mission led by the US military to establish a temporary pier in Gaza, in coordination with humanitarian partners and other countries, to enable the delivery of significant quantities of assistance by sea. These efforts will be closely coordinated with the government of Israel.”
But the statement also predicted that the delivery of humanitarian assistance directly to Gaza by sea would be complex, necessitating nations to continue “to assess and adjust our efforts to ensure we deliver aid as effectively as possible.”
“This maritime corridor can – and must – be part of a sustained effort to increase the flow of humanitarian aid and commercial commodities into Gaza through all possible routes,” it added.
“We will continue to work with Israel to expand deliveries by land, insisting that it facilitate more routes and open additional crossings to get more aid to more people. We affirm that protecting civilian lives is a key element of international humanitarian law that must be respected. And together, we must all do more to ensure aid gets to people who desperately need it.”
Here are some more of the latest images from the newswires:
UK support for the marine aid corridor to Gaza has involved assistance with planning and surveying, Downing Street has said, according to the Press Association (PA).
A Number 10 spokesperson said:
We will and have been supporting it. We have supported the US in planning for the pontoon, including by sending marine surveyors and will now be working with partners to operationalise our maritime aid corridor from Cyprus.
We continue to be very clear that we need to go much further, not enough aid is getting into Gaza, and we continue to push them to take further action, to do more to protect civilians, to abide by international humanitarian law and allow more aid in and to protect foreign aid workers and to facilitate humanitarian operations.
We continue to impress the importance of this in our conversations and as you’ve seen today we are also taking action with our allies to get more vital aid in.”
UK involvement in the maritime corridor is not expected to involve a deployment of British personnel to Gaza, added the PA.
Israel’s army said on Friday its initial probe into an incident that the Palestinian health authorities said left more than 100 Palestinians dead as crowds rushed an aid convoy, found troops “fired precisely” at approaching suspects, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).
World leaders had called for an investigation into the incident on 29 February when the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip said Israeli forces opened fire on people scrambling for food from a truck convoy. The Israeli military said at the time that a “stampede” occurred when thousands of people surrounded the convoy.
Releasing its initial findings on Friday, the military said in a statement that the “command review” found that “troops did not fire at the humanitarian convoy”. It added, however, that they “did fire at a number of suspects who approached the nearby forces and posed a threat to them”.
The health ministry in Gaza, in an updated toll issued on Friday, said 120 people were killed in the 29 February incident and at least 750 others were injured. It has previously alleged they were shot by Israeli forces.
Witnesses said thousands of people had rushed towards aid trucks in Gaza City early that morning, and that soldiers “fired at the crowd as people came too close to the tanks.”
A UN team that visited Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital the day after the incident reported seeing “a large number of gunshot wounds” among dozens of Palestinian patients.
In its statement on Friday, the military said about 12,000 Palestinians had gathered around the aid trucks and began taking the supplies, reports AFP.
“During the course of the looting, incidents of significant harm to civilians occurred from the stampede and people being run over by the trucks,” the army said.
At that time, “dozens of Gazans advanced towards nearby IDF troops, up to several metres from them, and thereby posed a real threat to the forces at that point,” it said.
The military said troops “fired cautionary fire in order to distance the suspects,” and after they continued to advance, “the troops fired precisely toward a number of suspects to remove the threat.”
A Hamas official told AFP that ceasefire negotiations were not over, on Friday.
“The mediators informed Hamas that efforts will continue to reach an agreement,” the official told AFP, requesting not to be named as he was not authorised to speak on the matter.
Israeli war cabinet member Gadi Eisenkot said Hamas was under “very serious pressure” from mediators to make a “counter-offer”. “Then it will be possible to advance it and take a position,” he said.
US president Joe Biden had urged Hamas to accept a ceasefire plan with Israel before Ramadan, but Hamas negotiators left talks with mediators in Egypt to consult with the movement’s leadership in Qatar.
According to AFP, Hamas’s delegation voiced dissatisfaction with Israeli responses so far before leaving Cairo, although US ambassador to Israel Jack Lew denied the talks had “broken down”.
We are hearing that the maiden aid voyage will be made by Spain’s Open Arms in what will be a test voyage of the sea corridor.
The vessel had been waiting at Cyprus’s port of Larnaca for permission to deliver food aid from World Central Kitchen, a US charity founded by celebrity chef José André.
The Guardian has learned that a joint statement by the EU, US, UK, Cyprus and the United Arab Emirates will detail how the aid operation will work.
Earlier this week a source familiar with the matter divulged that aid was being coordinated with the UAE.
Speaking from Nicosia, one western diplomat told us: “The facilities at the port are ready and the aim is to get the first shipment out before Sunday.”
Aid groups have welcomed US president Joe Biden’s announcement of relief finally reaching the war-ravaged coastal strip. But there are also fears that with needs now so desperate any shipment will be “a drop in the bucket.” Reacting to the news Mercy Corps’ vice-president of global policy and advocacy, Kate Phillips-Barrasso said this morning:
Any effort to get more aid into Gaza is needed and welcome as the entire population faces crisis levels of hunger and the abyss of famine. However, any ‘sea aid’ will be a drop in the bucket in terms of the volume and range of relief Palestinians need right now.
While inspection and logistics details are still unclear, any aid moving through this route would still be subject to many, if not all, the same impediments, delays, and bureaucratic obstacles we’re facing getting aid in through land crossings. And even if a seaport enables more aid into Gaza, once it arrives there is still no way to effectively distribute at the scale needed or to the people who are most urgently facing starvation absent a ceasefire.
The Biden administration is rightly focused on getting more lifesaving assistance to Palestinians trapped in Gaza – but ad hoc, time-consuming, and unsustainable workarounds like airdrops and offshore deliveries further underscore that the US is not adequately using its leverage with Israel to end the siege that is driving humanitarian needs or to enable increased, safe, and sustainable access for aid and aid workers in a meaningful way.”
Sigrid Kaag, the UN senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told reporters late on Thursday that air and sea deliveries cannot make up for a shortage of supply routes on land.
Speaking on the diversification of aid supply routes, after addressing the UN security council, Kaag told reporters that land remained the “optimal solution”. “It’s easier, it’s faster, it’s cheaper – particularly if we know we need to sustain humanitarian assistance to Gazans for a long period of time – and, of course, I’ve spoken to the importance of opening additional crossings,” she said.
Kaag said that while airdrops represented a “symbol of support for civilians in Gaza” and were “a testament to our shared humanity”, they were “a drop in the ocean”. “It’s far from enough,” she added.
Kaag commended the government of Cyprus for, what she called “their foresight and inclusive planning” on a maritime corridor to Gaza. She said:
In recent days you will have heard, and will hear more today or tomorrow, on a number of big countries joining and accelerating – or almost, I’d say, fast forwarding the establishment of a maritime corridor with a focus on humanitarian goods – and I think this is really important.”
However, she pointed out that delivering aid by air and sea could not to make up for a shortage of aid supply routes on land:
“Air or sea is not a substitute for what we need to see arrive at land.”
Kaag also spoke about other considerations regarding aid for Gaza: “Humanitarian assistance, and I’ve mentioned this before, is not an exercise in counting trucks. We need to know quality, relevance, it meets the needs, and as I said, volume.”
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she expected a maritime aid corridor to start operating between Cyprus and Gaza over this weekend, taking desperately needed aid to besieged Palestinians.
According to Reuters, von der Leyen said a pilot test run of food aid collected by a charity group and supported by the United Arab Emirates could be leaving Cyprus as early as Friday from the port of Larnaca in Cyprus.
The UK said it would work alongside the US to open a maritime corridor to deliver aid directly to Gaza, the UK’s foreign secretary David Cameron said on Friday.
“Alongside the US, the UK and partners have announced we will open a maritime corridor to deliver aid directly to Gaza,” Cameron said on social media.
“We continue to urge Israel to allow more trucks into Gaza as the fastest way to get aid to those who need it,” he added.
People in Gaza are in desperate humanitarian need. Alongside the US, the UK and partners have announced we will open a maritime corridor to deliver aid directly to Gaza. We continue to urge Israel to allow more trucks into Gaza as the fastest way to get aid to those who need…
The UN’s human rights office said on Friday that an Israeli offensive in Gaza’s border town of Rafah could not be allowed to happen because it would cause massive loss of life, reports Reuters.
“Should Israel launch its threatened military offensive into Rafah, where 1.5 million people have been displaced in deplorable, subhuman conditions, any ground assault on Rafah would incur massive loss of life and would heighten the risk of further atrocity crimes,” said Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for the UN human rights office.
“This must not be allowed to happen,” he said.
Here are some of the latest images on the newswires:
Over in Cyprus, EU Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen is holding talks with local leader Nikos Christodoulides in the latest fine-tuning of plans to create a maritime corridor from the east Mediterranean island to Gaza.
The EU chief, who arrived in the country last night, will travel from Nicosia, its capital, to Larnaca to inspect the command centre and port facilities that will be used to ship desperately needed aid to the besieged coastal strip a mere 210 nautical miles away.
Speaking to the state-run CyBC radio this morning the government spokesperson, Konstantinos Letymbiotis said an announcement on how the operation would work would be issued later today. “The presence of von der Leyen alone in Cyprus sends messages as to the progress of the Cypriot initiative,” he said.
Nicosia first proposed establishing an humanitarian maritime corridor to Gaza in October but the scheme is believed to have come up against the opposition of Israel which has repeatedly expressed concerns over the potential of Hamas to hide weapons among the aid shipments. Israeli agents would inspect supplies, expected to include food and medicines, both at the Cypriot port and once they were transferred on to ships.
The EU’s most easterly member state, Cyprus has good relations with Israel and the Arab world. Christodoulides has said the initiative highlights the strategic island’s ability to be “a bridge to the region.”
Officials have hinted that the first shipment could happen as early as Sunday, the expected start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

A US charity said it was loading aid for Gaza on to a boat in Cyprus, the first shipment to the war-ravaged territory along a maritime corridor the European Commission hopes will open this weekend, reports AFP.
The Spanish-flagged vessel Open Arms docked three weeks ago in the port of Larnaca in Cyprus, the closest EU country to the Gaza Strip.
“World Central Kitchen teams are in Cyprus loading pallets of humanitarian aid on to a boat headed to northern Gaza,” the charity said in a statement on Friday.
“We have been preparing for weeks alongside our trusted NGO partner Open Arms for the opening of a maritime aid corridor that would allow us to scale our efforts in the region,” it added.
The charity said it plans to tow a barge loaded with provisions for the people of Gaza, where dire humanitarian conditions more than five months into the Israel-Hamas war have led some countries to airdrop food and other assistance.

“The endeavor to establish a humanitarian maritime corridor in Gaza is making progress, and our tugboat stands prepared to embark at a moment’s notice, laden with tons of food, water, and vital supplies for Palestinian civilians,” Open Arms said on social media platform X.
In Larnaca, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen had earlier expressed hope that a maritime corridor could open this Sunday, although details remained unclear, according to AFP.
She said a “pilot operation” would be launched on Friday, aided by the United Arab Emirates which secured “the first of many shipments of goods to the people of Gaza“.
There are no functioning ports in Gaza and officials did not say where the initial shipments would go, whether they would be subject to inspection by Israel, or who would distribute aid.
The Pentagon said on Friday that a US plan to establish a “temporary offshore maritime pier” in Gaza would take up to 60 days and would probably involve more than 1,000 US personnel.
It has gone 6pm in Gaza, Tel Aviv and Beirut, and 7pm in Sana’a. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Middle East coverage here.
Here is a recap of the latest developments:
A Gaza-bound aid ship expected to make the maiden voyage along a new maritime corridor from Cyprus has yet to set sail because of logistical challenges. Government officials confirmed on Saturday that while a vessel belonging to the Spanish search and rescue group, Open Arms, had been loaded with food, water and other supplies, and was ready to depart the Mediterranean island, it was unlikely to leave before tomorrow.

Three Palestinian children died of dehydration and malnutrition at the northern al-Shifa hospital overnight, said the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry on Saturday. Its spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said this raised to 23 the number of Palestinians who had died of similar causes in nearly 10 days.
The Israeli military said it conducted arrests, located weapons and killed more than 30 fighters in Khan Younis, including in the Hamad area, in central Gaza and in the area of Beit Hanoun in the north, according to a statement on Saturday summarising its operations in Gaza over the past day.
Gaza’s health ministry said on Saturday that at least 82 people were killed in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip in the last day. In Khan Younis, medics said at least 23 people were killed in military raids on homes and in Israeli shelling of a housing project in the Hamad area of the city. In the northern Gaza Strip, Israeli fire killed a Palestinian fisher along the beach, medics said.
Israel struck one of the largest residential towers in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on early Saturday. The 12-floor building, located about 500 metres from the border with Egypt, was damaged in the strike. Dozens of families were made homeless though no casualties were reported, according to residents. However, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that “scores of civilians sustained various injuries”.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that it had struck one of the largest residential towers in Rafah overnight, saying it housed a “Hamas military asset”. The IDF said it had warned residents of the 12-floor Al-Masry Tower ahead of the strike, and said they all evacuated in time.
Canada and Sweden confirmed that they will restore funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). According to CBC News, Canada’s international development minister Ahmed Hussen confirmed the move at a press conference on Friday, while the Swedish government announced on Saturday that it would resume suspended payments with a grant of 200m crowns ($20m/£16m).
“This brutal war has ruptured any sense of a shared humanity,” said Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday. According to Reuters, she called for an end of hostilities to allow for meaningful aid distribution in Gaza, for Hamas to release all hostages without conditions and for Israel to treat Palestinians in its custody humanely and to permit them to contact their families.
US president, Joe Biden said it was “looking tough” to secure a ceasefire in Gaza before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is expected to begin in the coming days.
An attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels set off explosions ahead of a Singapore-flagged vessel in the Gulf of Aden, authorities said. The attack on Friday targeted the US bulk carrier Propel Fortune, which continued on its way, according to US Central Command (Centcom). “The missiles did not impact the vessel,” the US military said, adding that there were “no injuries or damages reported”. The Houthis said on Saturday they were behind the attack.
Houthi military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed that along with targeting the Propel Fortune, the Houthi forces also launched 37 drones targeting US warships. The US military said on Saturday that the US and allied forces had shot down 15 one-way attack drones fired by the Houthis into the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Centcom said the “large-scale” Houthi attack occurred before dawn into the Red Sea and adjacent Gulf of Aden.
Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Saturday that Ankara “firmly backs” the Palestinian militant group Hamas. “No one can make us qualify Hamas as a terrorist organisation,” he said in a speech in Istanbul. “Turkey is a country that speaks openly with Hamas leaders and firmly backs them.”
Hundreds of thousands of Pro-Palestinian activists marched through London calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, during a National Day of Action for Palestine on Saturday. The demonstration, organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), made its way from Hyde Park Corner to the US embassy in Nine Elms.
Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA’s commissioner-general told Swiss broadcaster RTS that the UN Palestinian refugee agency is at the “risk of death” after Israel alleged some of its staff took part in the 7 October Hamas attack. But, he said he was “cautiously optimistic” that “a number of donors will return” over the next few weeks and after an independent review of UNRWA is due to be published next month.
Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said the cost of rebuilding Gaza could exceed $90bn (£70bn). He made the comment during a speech marking Martyrs’ and Veterans’ Day in Egypt on Saturday.
Five people were killed and 10 injured in Gaza when they were hit by a pallet of aid parachuted into the territory as part of a humanitarian airdrop. Witnesses said the accident happened on Friday morning near the coastal refugee camp known as al-Shati, one of the most devastated parts of Gaza, after a parachute attached to the pallet failed to deploy properly.
A top US treasury official visiting Beirut this week pressed Lebanese authorities to prevent funds from being funneled to Hamas by way of Lebanon, officials told the Associated Press (AP).
The UN’s top aid official has renewed his call for a ceasefire in Gaza and outlined six priorities in the humanitarian response. In a social media post via the account of the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (Ocha) on Friday, Martin Griffiths, the UN emergency relief coordinator, listed six facts that “should keep us all awake at night” and six “things that would make a difference”.
Iran on Saturday denounced US tech company Meta’s decision to remove the Facebook and Instagram accounts of its supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling it a “violation of freedom of expression”. Meta’s move last month came as Khamenei increasingly voiced support for Palestinian militant group Hamas and denounced Israel amid the war between the two sides in the Gaza Strip.
The Iranian regime’s human rights violations during its brutal suppression of protests in 2022 amount to crimes against humanity, a UN fact-finding mission (FFM) said. Established by the UN human rights council in November 2022 – two months after the Woman, Life, Freedom protests swept the country in response to the death in custody of Mahsa Amini – the FFM released a report concluding the regime carried out widespread and sustained human rights violations against its own people, which broke international laws and specifically targeted women and girls.
A Gaza-bound aid ship expected to make the maiden voyage along a new maritime corridor from Cyprus has yet to set sail because of logistical challenges.
Government officials confirmed on Saturday that while a vessel belonging to the Spanish search and rescue group, Open Arms, had been loaded with food, water and other supplies, and was ready to depart the Mediterranean island, it was unlikely to leave before tomorrow.
“We are still waiting for the green light from Israel,” deputy government spokesperson Yiannis Antoniou told the Guardian. “And the weather will also play a role … the boat is going to move very slowly, it will take twice the time it would normally take, around 50 hours, to get there.”
Where “there” was also remains unclear. Although Israel’s foreign ministry has said shipments will be subject to inspection “according to Israeli standards,” who will distribute the assistance and what the destination of boats will be has still not been revealed because of security concerns.
“It is going to Gaza but at this stage we cannot say where it will offload,” Antoniou added, explaining that the mission is being seen as a test run by officials.
The island’s foreign minister Constantinos Kombos also made clear that while there was still optimism the operation would be activated “over the weekend” there were issues that had to be clarified.
Speaking to the Cyprus News agency, he said “speed should not affect efficiency, there has to be balance.”
“There are various issues and that’s why we say the window is this weekend [for the launch of the mission] as long as there isn’t an incident in Gaza, Israel or on the borders with Lebanon which could cause unrest and affect the operation, even the weather could cause problems.”
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has confirmed that it struck one of the largest residential towers in southern Gaza’s Rafah overnight, saying it housed a “Hamas military asset”, according to the Times of Israel.
According to the online newspaper, in response to a query on the strike, the IDF said: “Acts of terror against our forces and the civilian home front were planned from this asset.” The Times of Israel write: “According to a military source, the building was used by Hamas’s so-called emergency committee.”
The IDF said it had warned residents of the 12-floor Al-Masry Tower ahead of the strike, and said they all evacuated in time.
Reuters earlier reported that dozens of families living in the tower were made homeless though no casualties were reported, according to residents. However, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that “scores of civilians sustained various injuries”.
Here are some of the latest images coming in across the newswires from Saturday’s pro-Palestine march in London:
Reuters has more on the comments by Philippe Lazzarini, the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) commissioner general, who said the UN Palestinian refugee agency is at the “risk of death” after Israel alleged some of its staff took part in the 7 October Hamas attack.
According to Reuters, Lazzarini also said he was cautiously optimistic some donors would start funding UNRWA again within weeks.
An independent review of UNRWA has been launched under French former foreign minister Catherine Colonna, and the final report is expected to be published next month.
“I am cautiously optimistic that within the next few weeks, and also following the publication of Catherine Colonna’s report, a number of donors will return,” Lazzarini said in an interview with Swiss broadcaster RTS that was aired on Saturday. Lazzarini told RTS that UNRWA was at “risk of death, at risk of dismantlement.”
Colonna, whose work on the review began in mid-February, said on Saturday she would visit Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Ramallah and Amman next week.
UNRWA, which provides aid and essential services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and across the region, has been in crisis since Israel accused 12 of its 13,000 staff in Gaza of involvement in the 7 October attack on Israel. The allegations prompted several countries, including the US, to pause funding.
When the allegations emerged, UNRWA fired some staff members, saying it acted to protect the agency’s ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, and an independent internal UN investigation was launched.
Reuters reports that UNRWA said some employees released into Gaza from Israeli detention reported having been pressured by Israeli authorities into falsely stating that staff took part in the 7 October attack, according to a report by the agency dated February.
“What is at stake is the fate of the Palestinians today in Gaza in the short term who are going through an absolutely unprecedented humanitarian crisis,” Lazzarini told RTS.
UNRWA runs schools, healthcare clinics and other social services in Gaza, and distributes humanitarian aid. The UN has said 3,000 members of staff are still working to deliver aid in Gaza, where it says 576,000 people – one quarter of the population – are a step away from famine.
“The agency I currently manage is the only agency that delivers public services to Palestinian refugees,” Lazzarini said.
“We are the quasi-ministry of education, of primary health. If we were to get rid of such a body, who would bring back the million of girls and boys who are traumatised in the Gaza Strip today back to a learning environment?”
Houthi forces in Yemen claim to have launched one of their largest attacks on US shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, saying they sent 37 drones to hit US navy war ships and a commercial ship.
The US Central Command said it had stopped the attack, which it attributed to Iranian-backed Houthi forces. The US spoke of only shooting down 15, not 37, drones.
The Houthis in a statement issued by the group’s military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said the attack had been a success, but provided no evidence.
Among those repelling the Houthi attacks was a Danish frigate Iver Huitfeldt, which shot down four Houthi drones in the Red Sea on Friday night.
The commander on the Iver Huitfeldt, Capt Sune Lund, said: “At a little after 4am local time we recognised a drone which was heading towards Iver Huitfeldt and the surrounding ships. After making sure it was an enemy, we engaged and defeated it. Over the next hour this happened three more times.”
According to Reuters, in a speech marking Martyrs’ and Veterans’ Day in Egypt on Saturday, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said the cost of rebuilding Gaza could exceed $90bn (£70bn).
The Iranian regime’s human rights violations during its brutal suppression of protests in 2022 amount to crimes against humanity, a UN fact-finding mission (FFM) has said.
Established by the UN human rights council in November 2022 – two months after the Woman, Life, Freedom protests swept the country in response to the death in custody of Mahsa Amini – the FFM has released a report concluding the regime carried out widespread and sustained human rights violations against its own people, which broke international laws and specifically targeted women and girls.
The report also investigated and corroborated accounts published in the Guardian that female protesters had been specifically targeted because of their gender and were shot at close range in the face and genitals – actions the report cites as evidence of crimes committed by the state against the civilian population.
The report states: “The mission has … established that many of the serious human rights violations … amount to crimes against humanity – specifically those of murder; imprisonment; torture; rape and other forms of sexual violence; persecution; enforced disappearance and other inhumane acts – that have been committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against a civilian population, namely women, girls and others expressing support for human rights.”
According to Human Rights Watch, more than 500 people, including 68 children, were killed by security forces during the protests. It is estimated that more than 20,000 protesters were arrested.
Following Israel’s allegations that 12 staff took part in the 7 October attacks by Hamas, the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is now at “risk of death”, reports Reuters.
UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini told Swiss broadcaster RTS:
The agency is at risk of death, it is risking dismantlement.
What is at stake is the fate of the Palestinians today in Gaza in the short term who are going through an absolutely unprecedented humanitarian crisis.”

A top US treasury official visiting Beirut this week pressed Lebanese authorities to prevent funds from being funneled to Hamas by way of Lebanon, officials told the Associated Press (AP). Jesse Baker, deputy assistant secretary of the treasury for Asia and the Middle East in the office of terrorist financing and financial crimes, met Lebanese politicians and officials from the financial sector on Thursday and Friday.His visit came as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza appear to have stalled. Should the war continue during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which could begin late Sunday, many fear a regional escalation, including in Lebanon.
Near-daily low-level clashes have taken place between the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, and Israeli forces for more than five months, say AP.A US treasury official who spoke on condition of anonymity with AP to discuss sensitive matters said Baker had shared with Lebanese authorities “specific concerns” about “the movement of Hamas funds through Lebanon, Hezbollah funds from Iran into Lebanon and then out into other regional areas” and called for “proactive measures” to combat it.The official said that the groups need the flow of funds to pay their fighters and conduct military operations and cannot achieve their aims otherwise.The US treasury official added that, for Lebanon, showing compliance with global anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing standards is key to attracting investment from the US and the rest of the world and to pulling the country out of its protracted crisis.Baker pushed for Lebanon to crack down on the large sector of illicit financial service companies that have flourished amid the collapse of the country’s formal banking system over four years of economic crisis, including illegal money exchange and unlicensed money transfer operations, the US treasury official said.Those businesses – along with a cash economy that the World Bank has estimated amounts to nearly 46% of Lebanon’s GDP – have offered workarounds for people and groups barred from the formal financial system by US sanctions, including Hamas and Hezbollah, both of which Washington considers terrorist organisations.Walid Kilani, a spokesperson for Hamas in Lebanon, told AP he had “no information” about the matter.Halim Berti, spokesperson for Lebanon’s central bank, confirmed that officials with the institution had met Baker and described the meetings as “very positive.”He said that the central bank is doing its part to regulate licensed financial services businesses but that those operating without a licence are “not in our jurisdiction” and should be dealt with by law enforcement.
Three Palestinian children died of dehydration and malnutrition at the northern al-Shifa hospital overnight, said the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. Its spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said this raised to 23 the number of Palestinians who had died of similar causes in nearly 10 days, reports Reuters.
“This brutal war has ruptured any sense of a shared humanity,” said Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross. According to Reuters, she called for an end of hostilities to allow for meaningful aid distribution in Gaza, for Hamas to release all hostages without conditions and for Israel to treat Palestinians in its custody humanely and to permit them to contact their families.
In a statement summarising its operations in Gaza over the past day, the Israeli military said it conducted arrests, located weapons and killed more than 30 fighters in Khan Younis, including in the Hamad area, in central Gaza and in the area of Beit Hanoun in the north, reports Reuters.
Gaza’s health ministry said at least 82 people were killed in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip in the last day. In Khan Younis, medics said at least 23 people were killed in military raids on homes and in Israeli shelling of a housing project in the Hamad area of the city. In the northern Gaza Strip, Israeli fire killed a Palestinian fisher along the beach, medics said.
Israel struck one of the largest residential towers in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday, residents said, stepping up pressure on the last area of the territory it has not yet invaded and where over a million displaced Palestinians are sheltering, reports Reuters.
The 12-floor building, located about 500 metres from the border with Egypt, was damaged in the strike. Dozens of families were made homeless though no casualties were reported, according to residents. However, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that “scores of civilians sustained various injuries”.
The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment on the incident.
One of the tower’s 300 residents told Reuters that Israel gave them a 30-minute warning to flee the building at night. “People were startled, running down the stairs, some fell, it was chaos. People left their belongings and money,” said Mohammad al-Nabrees, adding that among those who tripped down the stairs during the panicked evacuation was a friend’s pregnant wife.
A Rafah-based official with the Fatah party, which dominates the Palestinian Authority that has limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank, another Palestinian territory, said he feared that hitting the Rafah tower was a sign of an imminent Israeli invasion, according to Reuters.
Canada has confirmed it will restore funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), reports the Canadian public broadcaster CBC.
According to CBC News, Canada’s international development minister Ahmed Hussen confirmed the move at a press conference on Friday in Mississauga.
Canada, along with a number of major donors, suspended funding to UNRWA in January after Israel alleged that 12 UNRWA employees were involved in the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.
CBC News first reported on Tuesday that the Canadian government intended to resume funding after Ottawa received an interim report from the UN’s investigation of Israel’s allegations.
Iran on Saturday denounced US tech company Meta’s decision to remove the Facebook and Instagram accounts of its supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling it a “violation of freedom of expression”, reports AFP.
Instagram and Facebook are among the most popular social media platforms for Iranians, but while the government blocks their use, officials in the Islamic republic have accounts on them.
Meta said last month it had removed Khamenei’s accounts from Facebook and Instagram for having “repeatedly violated” its policy on “dangerous organisations and individuals”, according to AFP.
In response, Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said the move was “not only a violation of freedom of speech, but also an insult to millions of followers of his positions and news”.
“The mottoes of freedom of expression by some western claimants are hollow and showy slogans and a cover for their illegitimate political goals,” he told the Middle East Eye news outlet in remarks also published by Iran’s foreign ministry.
Khamenei, 84, has been the country’s supreme leader since 1989, a position that allows him the final say in major state policies. He had about five million followers on Instagram.
Meta’s move on 8 February came as Khamenei increasingly voiced support for Palestinian militant group Hamas and denounced Israel amid the war between the two sides in the Gaza Strip.
“Khamenei is the most prominent supporter of the oppressed people of Palestine and Gaza in the world, and the Silicon Valley empire cannot prevent this voice from reaching the public opinion of the world,” Amir-Abdollahian said.
Despite the Iranian government’s ban on Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms including X, internet users in the Islamic republic can still access them using virtual private networks, or VPNs.
US president, Joe Biden, has dampened expectations of a ceasefire in Gaza before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is expected to begin in the coming days.
Biden was visiting Rose Valley, Pennsylvania, on Friday when reporters asked him about developments in talks between Hamas and Israel, to which he responded: ‘It’s looking tough.’
Biden also expressed concern about the prospect of violence during Ramadan between Israeli authorities and Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem, the location of the third holiest site in Islam, al-Aqsa mosque.
Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Saturday that Ankara “firmly backs” the Palestinian militant group Hamas, reports AFP.
“No one can make us qualify Hamas as a terrorist organisation,” he said in a speech in Istanbul. “Turkey is a country that speaks openly with Hamas leaders and firmly backs them.”
Erdoğan has been one of the most virulent critics of Israel since the start of the war in Gaza, which began after an 7 October attack by Hamas in Israel that claimed at least 1,160 lives, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
Israel has responded with a relentless ground and air offensive that the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said has killed at least 30,878 Palestinians, mostly women and children.
Erdoğan has called Israel a “terrorist state” and accused it of conducting a “genocide” in Gaza.

"West won’t stop Houthi attacks unless it works with Yemeni authorities, say experts",2024-03-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/11/houthi-attacks-red-sea-yemeni-authorities-west,"Calls for closer collaboration made after multiple Houthi drone strikes on ships in Red Sea over weekend
Western efforts to stop Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea will fail unless the US and its allies build stronger intelligence and military relations with the UN-recognised government in Yemen, politicians and experts are warning.
Yemen’s ambassador to the UK has warned the Houthis have to be confronted and driven away from Red Sea ports such as Hodeidah. Similar calls were made by members of the Yemeni government coalition when they visited London last month.
At present, American and British diplomats are reluctant to draw the Aden-based government closer into its Red Sea operations, fearing this could reignite a civil war that has been on effective hold since April 2022.
They worry as well that an outline peace plan agreed last October between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia could be cast aside if they start strengthening the UN-recognised government.
But they also acknowledge there is little sign US-UK strikes on Houthi positions along the coastline have had a full deterrent effect, and other options have to be kept on the table.
That assessment was underlined at the weekend when a multiple Houthi drone strike on western ships early on Saturday morning forced US, French, UK and Danish ships to become involved in a complex and largely successful operation to shoot down more than 35 Houthi drones and missiles. Four were aimed at the already stricken bulk carrier True Confidence, which was being escorted by the French frigate Alsace after being hit on Wednesday, killing three sailors. British and Danish ships both shot down drones in their vicinity.
The Italian destroyer Caio Duilio coordinated the four ships working as the EU protection force.
Since 19 October, the Yemeni movement has launched 403 missiles or drones against 61 ships. As many as 15 missiles have struck targets. The three most serious incidents have been the sinking of the Rubymar, the capture of Galaxy Leader and its crew, and the serious damage inflicted on True Confidence.
The Houthis, keen users of social media, also screened on Sunday a video of a mock Yemeni attack in the Negev desert in southern Israel, in which buildings displaying US, UK and Israeli flags were attacked. The US has admitted in congressional hearings that its intelligence about Houthi activity is limited.
Maj Gen Aidarous al-Zubaidi, vice-chair of the Aden-based Yemen government executive – the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) – on Sunday again called for western help in building its naval forces.
Yemen’s ambassador to London, Dr Yassin Saeed Noman Ahmed, said an opportunity existed to seize back control of the strategic port of Hodeidah from Houthi control. “We are facing a group that cannot live without war, and it is not surprising that it obstructs all peace efforts by insisting on plunging the country into a catastrophe of destruction.”
He claimed there was a new opportunity to take back Hodeidah – adding that peace would not be achieved without its liberation, and leaving it in Houthi hands would only prolong the war.
Different branches of the badly divided Aden-based government were in London last month, arguing the western position had been too reactive, and lacked an overall vision for how Yemen could fit into a new Middle East.
Tareq Saleh, a senior figure in the PLC, told a Chatham House seminar: “It is not possible that the Houthis got this many weapons in reaction to what is happening in Gaza. This has been pre-planned for years. The quantity of missiles and drones they have never came from our stocks. They have the markings and colour of the Iranians. The Iranians and the Houthis have been trying to hijack the Palestinian file from the Arab world.”
He said the crisis would not end with resolution in Gaza, since Iranians wanted to control the Strait of Hormuz and Red Sea. The Houthis say they are attacking Israeli-linked shipping in solidarity with Palestinians.
Tehran has denied any involvement in supplying weapons.
Baraa Shiban, an associate fellow at the defence thinktank Rusi, said: “Western governments do not have a basket of good options, but they need to work more with the UN recognised Yemeni government – the anti-Houthi bloc – more so it has the edge and leverage to prevent the coastline being controlled by the Houthis. The channels of communication between the Yemen government and western governments is surprisingly limited.
“You do not need to ignite the whole civil war again but you need to give them enough help to give them the advantage, and right now that is not what is happening.
“The UN backed forces on the west coast right now are sitting ducks waiting to be attacked by the Houthis. The Houthis are making the case to the public that they need to take control of the entire coast down the Babal-Mandab strait because they need to be able to hit shipping more accurately.”
Ta’izz governorate, which includes part of the west coast, is divided between Houthi and government control.
Shiban said: “This is going to be difficult. The Houthis finally have leverage over the international community and they are not going to give that up easily.”
The Aden-based government is in a quandary in that the Palestinian cause is popular in Yemen, and many see the Houthis as at least standing up to Israel in a way that other Gulf leaders have avoided. One expert claimed the Houthi actions in the Red Sea may have helped it to recruit tens of thousands of new fighters.
The Aden government is fighting back by claiming the Houthis actions including the sinking of the Rubymar will bring famine and a marine environmental disaster that will damage fishers’ lives for generations. The information minister, Moammar al-Eryani, said the disaster would lead to the proliferation of algae, forming a cover over the surface of the water and blocking light from it, leading to the death of coral reefs and marine animals.
In the absence of greater cooperation with the anti-Houthi bloc inside Yemen or any troops on the ground, western forces have limited other options apart from hoping more attacks on Yemen missile launch sites will finally degrade the Houthis’ effectiveness, or that upon a ceasefire in Gaza the Houthis will stick to their promise to end the attacks and there will be a revival of the peace process. But that requires diplomats treating the Houthis after the past four months as credible partners for peace.
The US has not ruled out targeted assassinations of key Houthi leaders, while US senators want the US to sink an Iranian ship, Beshad, that for months has been cited as a spy ship in US intelligence reports.

Middle East crisis: European Commission ‘hopeful’ first boat from Cyprus carrying aid to Gaza will set sail soon – as it happened,2024-03-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/11/middle-east-crisis-live-aid-ship-gaza-israel-latest-news,"The EU says the ship is just one of three routes to getting life-saving supplies to the population of Gaza
An aid ship carrying 200 tonnes of food to alleviate looming famine in the Gaza Strip remained docked in Cyprus on Sunday night, despite the push for maritime aid in the face of stalling ceasefire talks and the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
The Cyprus government spokesperson, Konstantinos Letymbiotis, told the island’s official news agency that the exact timing of the vessel’s departure would not be made public for “security reasons”. It was later reported that due to “technical difficulties”, it might not depart until Monday morning.
The delay in the departure of the aid ship highlights the complexity of delivering aid to Gaza through unconventional means. Israel has been repeatedly accused of not doing enough to facilitate humanitarian assistance to Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people. Its shallow shoreline waters and dearth of functioning ports make such maritime operations difficult, and it is unclear how much assistance via the new “sea highway” will affect the dire humanitarian situation on the ground.
After five months of war, the UN says a quarter of people in the besieged Palestinian territory are on the brink of starvation. The local health ministry said on Saturday that 23 people, including several children, had died of dehydration or malnutrition in the previous 10 days.

The European Commission has said it is “hopeful” that the first boat carrying aid to Gaza will set sail soon after delays over the weekend. Departure arrangements for the Open Arms vessel were in the hands of the Cypriots, a spokesperson said. The delay in the departure of the aid ship highlights the complexity of delivering aid to Gaza through unconventional means.
As Ramadan begins, the Hamas-led health ministry in Gaza issued new casualty figures, claiming at least 31,112 Palestinians have been killed and 72,760 wounded since 7 October in Israel’s military offensive on the Gaza Strip.
In its latest operational update, Israel’s military has claimed that “IDF troops struck terrorist operatives who endangered the forces in the central Gaza Strip” and that “special forces are continuing to operate in the area of Hamad in Khan Younis.”
Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, has issued a statement for Ramadan in which he cautions against making it “a month of jihad”. Gallant said “We tell everyone who is thinking of trying us – we are ready, don’t make mistakes.”
In a video statement Israel’s prime minister has claimed the country has killed a senior Hamas leader, without naming them. Benjamin Netanyahu told viewers “We are on the way to total victory. On the way to this victory, we already eliminated number four in Hamas. Three, two, and one are on the way. They are all dead men, we will reach them all”. It is unclear who Netanyahu was referring to, although Israeli media have speculated he may have meant deputy political leader Saleh al-Arouri. He was killed in Beirut in January.
The UN secretary-general António Guterres has reiterated his calls for an end to hostilities in Gaza and the increased delivery of humanitarian aid, describing international humanitarian law as in tatters. He told the media “International humanitarian law lies in tatters. And a threatened Israeli assault on Rafah could plummet the people of Gaza into an even deeper circle of hell”. He also called for the release of hostages held by Hamas and the removal of “all obstacles to ensure the delivery of lifesaving aid at the speed and massive scale required” to Gaza.
Twelve of Israel’s most prominent human rights organisations have signed an open letter accusing the country of failing to comply with the international court of justice’s (ICJ) provisional ruling that it should facilitate access of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Hezbollah has claimed it launched a multi-drone attack on an Israeli air defence outpost across from Lebanon in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel claimed two “suspicious aerial targets” struck open areas in the northern Golan Heights, and there are no reports of any damage of casualties.
British maritime security firm Ambrey has said it was aware of a missile-related incident west of Yemen’s Red Sea port city of Hodeidah. Local media has claimed “the Yemeni port of Ras Issa has been attacked by three airstrikes in what it calls “US-British aggression”. The claims have not been independently verified.
Police in Italy have arrested three Palestinians who they said were planning attacks in an unspecified country, according to a police statement.

Israel has never directly claimed the strike inside Lebanon’s capital.
Israeli media has also reported that Israel’s military is investigating whether it killed Hamas’s number three, Marwan Issa, over the weekend. The deputy head of the group’s military wing was reportedly killed in an airstrike Sunday.

Over the weekend, Islamic Relief reported that pregnant women and new mothers in Gaza are facing a constant struggle to keep themselves and their babies alive, amid life-threatening shortages of food, water and medical care. Of 36 hospitals in Gaza, just 12 are partially functioning, with the rest not functioning. The Hamas-led health ministry says the death toll since 7 October has reached over 31,100, and huge swathes of the population in Gaza have been displaced from their homes, and are living in makeshift tent camps in the south of the territory.
Hamas is believed to still be holding 134 hostages abducted from inside Israel on 7 October, not all of whom are thought to still be alive.
Al-Masirah, a Houthi-linked news channel, is claiming that the Yemeni port of Ras Issa has been attacked by three airstrikes in what it calls “US-British aggression”. The claims have not been independently verified.

The European Commission has said it is “hopeful” that the first boat carrying aid to Gaza will set sail soon after delays over the weekend. Departure arrangements for the Open Arms vessel were in the hands of the Cypriots, a spokesperson said.“We are very hopeful nonetheless that despite the delay that has happened over the weekend, the ship will be in a position to leave shortly and head for Gaza,” he added.It remains unclear why the boat has not yet left with local reports citing “technical issues.”Sources say the sailing of the first ship “was always going to be the most difficult” with security in Cyprus complete but questions over distribution of that aid on land understood to be delaying matters.The EU says the ship, which is separate to the US plans for a maritime corridor, is just one of three routes to getting life-saving supplies to the besieged population of Gaza where there are now warnings of starvation and famine.But the demand for aid still dwarfs supply, with just 200 tonnes of aid on the boat. EU figures show that 500 tonnes a day were being delivered in peacetime. On good days, during the conflict, about 100 tonnes have been delivered by land.A humanitarian airbridge has seen 41 flights to Egypt carrying vital supplies including shelter, medicine and hygiene kits. Separately the European Commission is also working on possible partnership to parachute aide in as the Jordanians and others have been doing.“The European Commission is responsible for the delivery of aid to Palestine, to Palestinians in Gaza, and this is what we’re working on. Yes, there are significant difficulties, which is why we’re looking at other options, like the maritime corridor which is being opened and like the airdrops. Of course in parallel, all efforts are being undertaken by the responsible actors in order to work on the political dimension of this conflict,” said the official spokesperson for the commission.The maritime corridor from Cyprus has been under discussion since late last year and could ultimately used for other purposes including reconstruction, the commission added.
Twelve of Israel’s most prominent human rights organisations have signed an open letter accusing the country of failing to comply with the international court of justice’s (ICJ) provisional ruling that it should facilitate access of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
The court in The Hague made a number of legal requirements of Israel when it issued a provisional ruling in late January in response to South Africa’s complaint accusing the state of committing genocide in its military campaign in Gaza.
The requirements included taking all measures to prevent intentional harm to civilians, facilitating immediate humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, preventing and punishing direct or public incitement to genocide, and preserving evidence of any wrongful acts committed during the country’s war against Hamas.
In their letter, the rights groups say Israel was legally obliged to implement the measures ordered by the court but has so far failed to do so. Signatories to the letter include the military whistleblower group Breaking the Silence and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.
“The ICJ order is a legal obligation to end the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. It must be abided by, not only to ease the urgent suffering of civilians but for the sake of humanity as a whole,” the letter says. It also notes that the ICJ urged Hamas to immediately and unconditionally release all Israeli hostages.

Italian police have arrested three Palestinians based in central Italy who they said were planning attacks in an unspecified country, according to a police statement.
Reuters reports:
The three men living in l’Aquila, about 120 km (75 miles) northeast of Rome, had set up a cell linked to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, it said.
The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades is an armed group that is linked to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah movement and is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the European Union and the United States.
Police said the three Palestinians had been charged with criminal conspiracy for terrorism purposes or subversion of the democratic order, which carries jail terms of up to 15 years.
Police said:
The suspects engaged in proselytism and propaganda (...) and planned attacks, including suicide attacks, against civilian and military targets on foreign territory.
One of the three men is wanted by Israel, and an Italian court is examining an extradition request for him, the statement added.
In a separate statement, Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi hailed the arrest of “three dangerous terrorists” and said Italy was always on high alert against extremism and radicalisation.
There was no immediate comment by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.

The Times of Israel quotes Gallant saying:
The month of Ramadan is an important month in which the Qur’an was revealed and in which there is an opportunity to improve neighbourly relations and strengthen family ties.
We are aware that the month of Ramadan may be a month of jihad. We tell everyone who is thinking of trying us – we are ready, don’t make mistakes.
Mona Chalabi and Andrew Witherspoon have produced this interactive for us today, entitled The Story of Gaza’s Destruction in 100 Lives, which tries to put the figures emerging from the territory into context. As Chalabi writes:
Rafah, the southernmost province of Gaza, had a prewar population of 280,000; now it holds almost 1.5 million people, most of them in tents that are not able to provide adequate shelter during cold and rainy weather, let alone offer sanitation facilities. Five hundred people share a single toilet.
The 15% of Gazans who have not been displaced from their homes are not necessarily any less vulnerable than their displaced neighbors. Frequently, those who stay are compelled to do so because disability makes movement impossible. When someone is too unwell to evacuate, family members are often reluctant to leave them behind.

Reuters reports British maritime security firm Ambrey has said it was aware of a missile-related incident west of Yemen’s Red Sea port city of Hodeidah.
More details soon …
Hezbollah has claimed it launched a multi-drone attack on an Israeli air defence outpost across from Lebanon in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Reuters reports it said the attack, in which it deployed four drones, hit its target with “accuracy”. It described it as an operation in support of Palestinian groups in Gaza.
Israel has occupied the Golan Heights since capturing them from Syria in 1967.
The IDF claimed this morning that two “suspicious aerial targets” struck open areas in the northern Golan Heights, and there are no reports of any damage of casualties.
The claims have not been independently verified.
Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Gaza and Israel.

"Middle East crisis: Israel and Hamas ‘not near a truce’, says Qatar; Biden ‘devastated’ US-Israeli citizen killed in 7 October attack – as it happened",2024-03-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/12/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-gaza-houthis-ramadan-yemen-latest-news-updates,"All parties ‘continuing to work in negotiations’, says Qatar; US president says he has heavy heart after learning of death of Itay Chen. This live blog is closed

Israel and Hamas are not close to a deal on a cessation of hostilities in Gaza and releasing hostages, Qatar, which is acting as a mediator, has said.
“We are not near a deal, meaning that we are not seeing both sides converging on language that can resolve the current disagreement over the implementation of a deal,” foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari told a news conference.
All parties were “continuing to work in the negotiations to reach a deal hopefully within the confines of Ramadan,” Ansari said.
But he added that he could not “offer any timeline” on a deal and explained the conflict remained “very complicated on the ground”.
Israel’s war on Gaza was triggered last October after Hamas, the militant organisation that has ruled Gaza since 2007, killed 1,200 Israelis, mainly civilians, and abducted another 250 in surprise attacks in southern Israel. About half of the hostages were released during a short-lived ceasefire in November.
Hamas has said it will not release all of the remaining hostages without a full Israeli withdrawal. A second demand is the release of a large number of prisoners, including senior militant figures serving life sentences, in exchange for the hostages.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has called Hamas’s demands “delusional”.
The US president, Joe Biden, said he was “devastated” to learn that dual US-Israel citizen Itay Chen, 19, was killed in Hamas’ 7 October attack on Israel. Chen, who was serving in the Israeli army near the Gaza border, was earlier believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas.
At least 31,184 Palestinians have been killed and 72,889 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. Palestinian health officials have reported that nine Palestinians were killed and dozens injured by Israeli gunfire when crowds were awaiting aid trucks at the Kuwait Square in Gaza City.
A charity ship that has been docked in Cyprus for close to a month finally set sail for Gaza, taking almost 200 tonnes of aid in a pilot project to open a new sea route for aid to a population on the brink of famine. A video showed the Open Arms boat departing the Mediterranean island’s southern port of Larnaca at an unknown time early on Tuesday.
In response, the EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, thanked the president of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides, for the island’s “leadership in setting up the humanitarian maritime corridor to Gaza”. The EU chief wrote on X that the “the departure of the first ship is a sign of hope. We will work together for many more ships to follow. We will do everything in our power for aid to reach Palestinians.” The Open Arms aid ship is expected to arrive in Gaza around the same time that a US army ship, the General Frank S. Besson, is also expected to reach the territory’s shores. Separately, the World Food Programme said it has succesfully delivered enough food for 25,000 people to Gaza City on Tuesday, in its first successful convoy to the north of the enclave since 20 February.
Ursula von der Leyen warned that starvation of people in Gaza cannot be allowed to happen, amid reports of children dying of malnutrition and mothers giving birth to underweight babies because of a lack of food. “The situation on the ground is more dramatic than ever, and it has reached a tipping point. We have all seen the reports of children dying of starvation. This cannot be,” she told the European parliament in an address.
Israeli warplanes struck deep into Lebanon for a second consecutive day on Tuesday, hitting a facility belonging to Hezbollah in the Bekaa Valley and killing at least one member of the Iran-backed group, sources in Lebanon told Reuters. The Israeli military said its fighter jets had “struck two Hezbollah military command centers” in the Baalbek area, in response to Hezbollah rocket launches towards northern Israel earlier in the day.
Airstrikes carried out by the US have hit port cities and small towns in western Yemen, killing at least 11 people and injuring 14, a spokesperson for Yemen’s internationally recognised government has told Reuters. US Central Command said it carried out six strikes on Monday, claiming it destroyed an unmanned underwater vessel and 18 anti-ship missiles in Houthi controlled areas. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said on Tuesday that the group would escalate their military operations during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
The World Food Programme (WFP) said it has succesfully delivered enough food for 25,000 people to Gaza City on Tuesday, in its first successful convoy to the north of the enclave since 20 February.
“With people in northern Gaza on the brink of famine, we need deliveries every day + we need entry points directly into the north,” it wrote in a post on X.

The UN’s food agency said it was “largely unsuccessful” in its attempt last week to resume deliveries to northern Gaza, which is nearing famine.
The WFP said on 20 February it was pausing deliveries of food aid to northern Gaza until conditions in the Palestinian enclave allow for safe distribution.
The US president, Joe Biden, said he was “devastated” to learn that dual US-Israel citizen Itay Chen was killed in Hamas’ 7 October attack on Israel.
“I reaffirm my pledge to all the families of those still held hostage: we are with you. We will never stop working to bring your loved ones home,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House.
Chen, who was serving in the Israeli army near the Gaza border, was earlier believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas (see post at 13.16).
The full statement from the White House reads:
Today, our hearts are heavy. Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Itay Chen was killed by Hamas during its brutal terrorist assault on 7 October.In December, Itay’s father and brother joined me at the White House, to share the agony and uncertainty they’ve faced as they prayed for the safe return of their loved one. No one should have to endure even one day of what they have gone through. At the end of our meeting, they gave me a menorah-a solemn reminder that light will always dispel the darkness, and evil will not win.Today, as we join Itay’s parents, brothers, and family in grieving this tragic loss, we keep this reminder close to our hearts.
And I reaffirm my pledge to all the families of those still held hostage: we are with you. We will never stop working to bring your loved ones home.
Palestinian health officials have reported that nine Palestinians were killed and dozens injured by Israeli gunfire when crowds were awaiting aid trucks at the Kuwait Square in Gaza City. There was no immediate comment from Israel on this.
“Bombing gatherings of hungry people has become a daily routine practiced by the occupation and seen by the international community on screens,” Ashraf Al-Qidra, spokesperson for the Gaza health ministry, said.
“Hunger will claim the lives of all residents in northern Gaza. Aid is very scarce. The price of a meal could mean certain death. Help the people of the north. Don’t leave them prey to hunger, bombing, and disease.”
Last month, more than 100 people were killed when Israeli forces opened fire near an aid convoy in Gaza. Israeli military has said most died in a stampede. The Palestinians, however, say that Israeli forces carried out a massacre, opening fire on a crowd of people who had gathered in the hope that food would be distributed.
The Israeli military said a soldier believed to be held captive in Gaza had been killed in the 7 October attack, AFP reports.
Sergeant Itay Chen, 19, “fell on 7 October and was then kidnapped” to the Gaza Strip by Palestinian militants, the military said in a statement.
During Hamas’ October attack on Israel, about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 abducted, according to Israeli figures.

Citing the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS), Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that the number of Palestinians detained by Israeli security forces since 7 October in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has reached about 7,555 people.
Wafa reports “From yesterday evening until this morning, the occupation forces launched a massive arrest campaign that targeted at least 25 West Bank citizens, including former prisoners.”
Reuters reports that local sources have told it that one Hezbollah member was killed and several more were wounded in an Israeli airstrike in the village of Nabi Chit inside Lebanon. Hezbollah claimed earlier on Tuesday that it had fired more than 100 rockets at Israeli targets.
Fundraising platform GoFundMe has said that since the 7 October attacks, more than $69m (£54m / €63m) has been donated to causes associated with the crisis in the Middle East. Fundraisers to help people evacuate from Gaza have received more than 155,000 unique donations, it said.
A spokesperson for the platform said it had set up a page explaining to users how to fundraise to evacuate civilians from Gaza in a way that “will comply with applicable laws and regulations and make the flow of funds from donors to beneficiaries as fast as possible”.
One person in Deir el-Balah inside the Gaza Strip has spoken to Al Jazeera. Hussain al-Ramlawi told the news network:
We don’t have anywhere to go. All that we have is to stay and wait for our turns to be killed. What is happening is beyond any human’s capability. My children are terrorised. Even in Ramadan, we are being killed and are unable to worship God. Where are the human rights organisations? Living in this world as Palestinians is a curse.
The network reports that Israeli tanks have been hitting the outskirts of Deir el-Balah, and that there have been at least four airstrikes. Images sent over the news wires today show a number of bodies being received for burial from the morgue of Al-Aqsa hospital.
In an update on X, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had located a ‘terrorist compound” containing weapons, including AK-47 rifles and explosive devices, in Hamad, and killed four “terrorist operatives” attempting to plant explosives.
In northern and central Gaza, the IDF said it dismantled rocket launchers that were used to fire toward Israeli territory, cleared the area of weapons and killed “terrorists firing rockets at troops”.
“In response to mortar shells fired at Israel, the IAF struck the terrorist, terrorist compounds and terrorist infrastructure,” the IDF wrote.

At least 31,184 Palestinians have been killed and 72,889 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
Most of the casualties have been women and children, the ministry has said, and thousands more bodies are likely to remain uncounted under rubble across Gaza.
A charity ship that has been docked in Cyprus for close to a month finally set sail for Gaza, taking almost 200 tonnes of aid in a pilot project to open a new sea route for aid to a population on the brink of famine.

Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, said it fired more than 100 Katyusha rockets at several Israeli military posts in response to Israeli shelling of the Bekaa region the previous night. At least one civilian was killed and several others injured after Israel launched four strikes on the eastern Lebanese city Baalbek, two security sources and the Baalbek governor, Bashir Khader, told Reuters.
Airstrikes carried out by the US have hit port cities and small towns in western Yemen, killing at least 11 people and injuring 14, a spokesperson for Yemen’s internationally recognised government has told Reuters. US Central Command said it carried out six strikes on Monday, claiming it destroyed an unmanned underwater vessel and 18 anti-ship missiles in Houthi controlled areas. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said on Tuesday that the group would escalate their military operations during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
An Italian military vessel serving in the EU’s naval mission in the Red Sea has shot down two drones, Italy’s defence staff has said.
It described the incidents involving the Italian Navy’s “Caio Duilio” destroyer as acts of self-defence, without elaborating on the details. The same ship had shot down another drone earlier this month.
The EU’s mission in the Red Sea was launched in February to help protect the key maritime trade route from drone and missile attacks by Yemen’s Houthi militia, who say they are retaliating against Israel’s war in Gaza.
The statement from Italy’s defence staff comes after reports of airstrikes being carried out by the US in western Yemen.
Al Jazeera has this on a report by Save the Children which warns of the huge psychological damage being done to Palestinian children affected by Israel’s war in Gaza:
Without urgent action, Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip will inflict further lifelong detrimental mental harm to Palestinian children, with rapidly shrinking opportunities to recover, a report by Save the Children said.
The report notes that before 7 October, children in Gaza were already living with exceptionally poor mental health due to the 16 years of a blockade, lack of freedom of movement, various Israeli escalations on the Strip, economic collapse, and separation from family and friends.
“It is unacceptable that any child should contend with the horrors that those in Gaza have lived through,” said Jason Lee, Save the Children’s country director for the occupied Palestinian territories.
“While dodging bombs and bullets, fleeing through streets littered with debris and corpses, being forced to sleep in the open air and going without the basic food and clean water they need to survive, children in Gaza are going through a period of mass-scale shock and grief.
“This war and the physical and mental scars it is leaving on children is further eroding their resilience.”
EU leaders will demand an “immediate humanitarian pause leading to a sustainable ceasefire” in Gaza and urge Israel not to launch a ground operation in Rafah, according to draft conclusions of a summit to take place next week.
“The European Council urges the Israeli government to refrain from a ground operation in Rafah, where well over a million Palestinians are currently seeking safety from the fighting and access to humanitarian assistance,” says the draft text, seen by Reuters.
The text will require the approval of all the EU’s 27 national leaders to be adopted at the summit on 21 March and 22.
There was significant pressure on Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire before Ramadan, which started on Monday for Palestinians. However, no deal was made.
Israel has previously said its aim is to destroy Hamas and that any ceasefire must be temporary. It has also pressed for a list of hostages still alive and held by Hamas in Gaza.
Hamas officials have said a ceasefire must be in place before the hostages are freed, Israeli forces must leave Gaza and all Gazans must be able to return to homes they have fled.

Charity hopes to send second food aid ship to Gaza in next few days,2024-03-14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/14/charity-hopes-to-send-second-food-aid-ship-to-gaza-in-next-few-days,"Pallets with 50% more supplies than first boat, Open Arms, being loaded in Cyprus
The charity sending food aid to Gaza on a ship travelling across the Mediterranean from Cyprus is loading a second boat with supplies, which it hopes will set off in the coming days.
Pallets containing 300 tonnes of food aid – 50% more than the first shipment – are expected to be screened and loaded by the end of Thursday, but there is no indication yet when it will leave the port of Larnaca.
The supplies include cans of beans, carrots, tuna, chickpeas and corn, plus parboiled rice, flour, oil and salt.
The UN has warned that at least 576,000 people in Gaza – a quarter of the population – are on the brink of famine and global pressure has been growing on Israel to allow more access to the territory.
Janez Lenarčič, the EU’s humanitarian aid and crisis management chief, said on Thursday there were already pockets of famine in Gaza, and warned it could spread to the whole region. He urged Israel to open more road routes to deliver aid.
The first ship, which is towing a barge loaded with 200 tonnes of aid, enough for half a million meals, is expected to arrive on the Gaza coast in the coming days after leaving Larnarca on Tuesday.
World Central Kitchen (WCK), a US-based food aid charity working with the governments of Cyprus and the UAE and the Spanish NGO Open Arms, had an additional 500 tonnes of aid in Cyprus ready to be loaded in what it hoped would be a series of journeys across the Mediterranean, which have been given the name Operation Safeena, meaning boat or vessel in Arabic.
Theodoros Gotsis, spokesperson for Cyprus’s foreign ministry, said the Spanish-flagged aid ship was making “good progress” and was on course for the Gaza coast. It was taking longer than expected to arrive because the boat was by necessity moving very slowly. Tracking apps had “been jammed” because the ship was sailing in seas off a war zone where communication was patchy, he said.
It was still uncertain on Thursday how the aid would be unloaded and distributed once it reached the Gaza coastline. WCK volunteers and others in Gaza are building a jetty from the rubble of buildings destroyed in Israeli bombing during the past five months.
Gaza was the “most politically complex environment WCK has operated in”, its founder, the Michelin-starred chef José Andrés, said on the charity’s website at the weekend. A spokesperson said on Thursday that plans for docking and distribution were being continually adapted.
Gaza health ministry officials, meanwhile, said six people had been killed and dozens wounded when the Israeli military opened fire as crowds waited for aid trucks in Gaza City on Wednesday evening. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the incident.
It is the latest in a series of chaotic scenes and deadly incidents at aid distributions as desperately hungry people scramble for food. More than 100 people were killed last month as they waited for an aid delivery near Gaza City. Palestinian health authorities said Israeli forces shot them, while Israel said the victims had been trampled or run over.
Aid agencies in recent days have sought to vary routes for convoys to avoid large numbers of people gathering and potentially stopping convoys.“The problem is there are very few routes to take, and all are very difficult to travel on. There have been tanks driving up and down them for months and they are basically just strips of rubble now. So people can predict where the trucks are going to be,” said an NGO official in Gaza, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The White House called for a swift investigation into an Israeli airstrike this week on a UN food distribution facility in Gaza.
Israel said the strike had killed a Hamas commander whom it targeted, and Palestinian health officials said it had killed four more people, including a UN worker.
On Wednesday, R Adm Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the Israeli military, said Israel would try to “flood” the Gaza Strip with humanitarian aid from multiple entry points.
More convoys would follow six aid trucks with supplies from the World Food Programme that entered the northern part of the Gaza Strip this week through a crossing in the security fence known as the 96th gate. There would also be deliveries from other entry points, complemented by airdrops and seaborne aid cargoes, Hagari said.
Hamas was reported by local media to have killed the head of a powerful family in the territory for stealing aid and having contact with Israel. There was no immediate confirmation of the claim, but earlier this week Hamas threatened to execute “collaborators”.Tensions in Israel and the occupied territories remain high ahead of the first Friday prayers of Ramadan. Hamas has called for a “day of escalation”, and thousands of police have been deployed around Jerusalem’s Old City.
On Thursday, Netanyahu met families of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza and said he had little positive news. The Israeli prime minister said there had been no “real response” to terms offered for a ceasefire earlier this month.
“They are still clinging to unacceptable demands ... They do not want to make progress. They want to ignite the ground during Ramadan. This is their attempt; this is their goal,” he said.

‘Man-made famine’ charge against Israel is backed by mounting body of evidence,2024-03-20,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/20/man-made-famine-charge-israel-mounting-evidence-un-gaza,"Prospect of Israel facing war crimes charges has moved closer after UN condemnation of Gaza aid restrictions
The accusation by the UN and other humanitarians that Israel may be committing a war crime by deliberately starving Gaza’s population is likely to significantly increase the prospect of legal culpability for the country, including at the international court of justice.
Amid reports that the Israel Defense Forces are hiring dozens of lawyers to defend against anticipated cases and legal challenges, the charge that Israel has triggered a “man-made famine” by deliberately obstructing the entry of aid into Gaza is backed by an increasing body of evidence.
Already facing a complaint of genocide from South Africa at the ICJ, the UN’s top court – including an allegation that senior Israeli political officials have incited genocide in public statements – Israel is also the subject of a provisional emergency ruling by the court ordering it to admit life-saving aid to Gaza.
On Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, underlined the growing sense of crisis as he warned that all of Gaza’s 2 million people were experiencing “severe levels of acute food insecurity” – the first time an entire population of Gaza has been so classified.
Unlike other issues related to Israel’s conduct in its war against Hamas in Gaza, which has claimed more than 30,000 lives and displaced more than 85% of the population amid widespread destruction, the human-made famine occurring in the Palestinian territory appears more straightforward.
While the question of civilian casualties from specific attacks and from the wider policy of bombing will need to be tested against highly contested notions in international humanitarian law such as proportionality and necessity in conflict, the war crime of starvation is simply and clearly defined.
Though Israel denies the allegation, the Rome statute of the international criminal court defines it as the crime of intentionally starving civilians by “depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival” including “wilfully impeding relief supplies”.
Underpinning the allegations is the fact that as a belligerent occupying power in Gaza, Israel is legally responsible under article 55 of the fourth Geneva convention for “ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population”, which requires the occupier to “bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate”.
A central plank of any case that Israel has provoked a famine is the data generated by the UN’s Gaza famine review committee, staffed by international experts on food security, whose findings this week fall under the auspices of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) – regarded as the international gold standard in assessing food crises.
Highly technical, often cautious and designed to be neutral in its analysis, the committee – which had already warned of the risk of famine not least in the worst affected region of northern Gaza – has relied on World Food Programme surveys that concludedPalestinians were already facing IPC phase 4 and 5 levels of malnutrition – “emergency” and “catastrophe”.
The IPC committee also examined access for food trucks to the worst affected area, concluding that a “very limited number of trucks carrying food aid is authorised to enter north Gaza and Gaza governates and since 5 February there has been no report of food trucks being able to discharge in Gaza City”.
The IPC’s report is backed up by analysis prepared independently and sent this week to the Biden administration by Oxfam America and Human Rights Watch to highlight Israel’s failure to comply with a new requirement from Washington that recipients of US arms supplies need to comply with international law.
That analysis accused Israel of “systematically prevent[ing] aid” from reaching “the roughly 300,000 Palestinians who remain in northern Gaza, where the threat of starvation is most acute”.
The two organisations added that in the first six weeks of this year, “over half of the planned humanitarian aid missions to northern Gaza were obstructed by Israeli authorities”. Charging Israel with a deliberate policy of starvation, the documents adds: “International humanitarian law prohibits parties to a conflict from deliberately causing ‘the population to suffer hunger, particularly by depriving it of its sources of food or of supplies’.”
Exacerbating Israel’s legal exposure over the issue of starvation are public comments made early in the war by the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, advocating a “complete siege of Gaza” and making clear that he meant: “No electricity, no food, no water.”
“We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly,” he said.
While Israel has allowed a minimum of aid to enter under pressure from the US and wider international community, it has faced repeated complaints, including from Joe Biden, that the quality is insufficient, prompting air drops and attempts to open a sea bridge by other countries.
The claims about using starvation as a weapon of war come amid a growing and palpable sense of anxiety in the Israeli military over the mounting legal risks from its offensive on Gaza.
Speaking to the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, an unamed IDF official said: “The international legal pressure on Israel began gradually before the war, when the international criminal court supported an investigation against Israel in 2019, and in 2021 declared that they have the authority to do that.
“Now the pressure by many countries to prioritise legal action against the IDF and the state has only increased, and not only from South Africa’s direction. Just this month the international criminal court issued arrest warrants against two Russian generals for allegedly attacking a Ukrainian power plant and for causing noncombatant casualties without justification.”

We are about to witness in Gaza the most intense famine since the second world war | Alex de Waal,2024-03-21,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/21/we-are-about-to-witness-the-most-intense-famine-since-world-war-ii-in-gaza,"Gaza’s health crisis has its own dreadful momentum. Even if the shooting ends today and the aid trucks begin to roll, the dying will carry on for some time
Gaza is already the most intense starvation catastrophe of recent decades. The death toll from hunger and disease may soon surpass the body count from bombs and bullets.
The Famine Review Committee reported this week that Gaza is facing “imminent famine”.
The Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) system, set up 20 years ago, provides the most authoritative assessments of humanitarian crises. Its figures for Gaza are the worst ever by any metric. It estimates that 677,000 people, or 32% of all Gazans, are in “catastrophic” conditions today and a further 41% are in “emergency” conditions. It expects fully half of Gazans, more than 1 million people, to be in “catastrophe” or “famine” within weeks.
A parallel report from the Famine Early Warning System Network of the US Agency for International Development sounds the same alarm. It is the clearest warning that the network has given at any time in its 40-year history.
A rule of thumb is that “catastrophe” or “famine” conditions mean a daily death rate from from hunger or disease of two people out of 10,000. About half are children under five years old. The arithmetic is simple. For a population of 1 million, that is 200 deaths per day, 6,000 per month.
By way of comparison, the worst famine on the IPC record books struck Somalia in 2011, through a combination of war, drought and a shutoff in aid. At its nadir, 490,000 people were in “catastrophe” conditions with a larger number in “emergency” conditions. An estimated 258,000 people perished over 18 months.
The only other occasion when IPC data showed famine was in South Sudan in 2017. Civil war plunged half the country’s 10 million people into a food emergency, with 90,000 suffering famine. About 1,500 people starved to death in the two districts devastated by famine, but four years of wider food emergency claimed about 190,000 lives.
The “famine” threshold is arbitrary. In the next-worst stage, that of “emergency” conditions, children are already dying of starvation. When experts first drew up a prototype “famine scale”, they had a lower bar for declaring famine, roughly equivalent to the IPC’s “emergency”, and included “severe” and “extreme” famine categories that correspond to the IPC’s “famine” conditions. They also included a measure of magnitude – total numbers affected and dying – and later considered duration too. Some food emergencies last years, with the death toll slowly accumulating, without ever crossing the IPC’s “famine” threshold.
Famine was never declared for Yemen. But food emergency affecting millions over years of war caused as many as 250,000 starvation deaths. In the Tigray region of Ethiopia, the story is similar.
We are about to witness most intense famine since the second world war. It won’t be the biggest, because starvation is confined to the 2.2 million residents of the Gaza Strip.
Our picture of starvation is a stick-thin child wasting away, whose eyes seem swollen as her skin shrinks to her bones. Some children suffer kwashiorkor, acute malnutrition marked by a tell-tale swollen belly.
As the body starves, its immune system begins to fail. The malnourished fall prey to waterborne infections and suffer diarrhoea, which causes devastating dehydration. Other communicable diseases – which today could include Covid – also ravage communities. The most common cause of death in a famine is disease, not starvation as such.
“Starvation” is defined in international criminal law as depriving people of objects indispensable to survival. That includes not just food but also medicine, clean water, sanitation, shelter, cooking fuel and maternal care for children.
When people are driven from their homes into overcrowded camps, when water supplies are scarce or unclean, when toilets are nonexistent or unsanitary, when injuries are left untreated, disease outbreaks become more common and more deadly.
Lacking shelter and exposed to cold and rain in winter, and heat and dust in summer, people succumb to hunger and disease more quickly. Without electricity or cooking fuel, mothers cannot prepare meals that young children can readily digest.
Epidemiologists in London and Baltimore have generated projections for the likely death toll in Gaza from all causes over the months to August. If epidemics are included, their “status quo” scenario projects a range of 48,210 to 193,180 deaths, while under the “with escalation” scenario those figures range even higher.
Gaza’s health crisis has its own dreadful momentum. Even if the shooting ends today and the aid trucks begin to roll, the dying will carry on for some time.
And even when the numbers of people needlessly dying dwindle, the scars of famine will endure.
Little children who survive starvation face lifelong deprivation. They tend to grow up to be shorter than their peers and suffer reduced intellectual capacity. The World Health Organization warns of an “inter-generational cycle of malnutrition” whereby infants with low birth weight or undernourished girls grow into smaller and less healthy mothers. The damage caused by the 1944 Dutch hunger winter can still be observed generations on.
Famine is a social trauma too. It tears apart communities and destroys livelihoods. People are forced into the utmost indignities, breaking taboos in what they can eat and how they can get the necessities of life. Mothers have to ration the food they give to their children. They turn away hungry neighbours from their door. Families sell their most treasured heirlooms for a pittance to buy a meal.
What solace is it to tell parents who have buried their child that it was not their fault? Survivors’ anguish lasts a lifetime.
Such is the lingering sense of shame that people cannot speak openly about famine, sometimes for generations. It took almost 150 years before Ireland began publicly to commemorate the great hunger of the 1840s.
All of this is known. And in Gaza there is no margin of doubt.
In most famines, there’s a margin of uncertainty in predictions, because people may be able to find unexpected sources of food or money. In parts of rural Africa, grandmothers may know about edible wild roots and berries or migrant workers may find creative ways of sending cash to their families. In Gaza, Israel knows every calorie that’s available. In 2008, the coordinator of government activities in the territories calculated every aspect of Gaza’s food production and consumption, in minute detail, and extracted the “red lines” needed to keep Palestinians on what it called a “diet”, just short of starvation.
Until 7 October 2023, Israel was, according to its own analysis, just on the right side of the international laws prohibiting starvation. About 500 truckloads of essentials entered every day to complement local farms, fisheries and livestock. In recent months, less than one-third of that number has been allowed to enter, while local food production has been reduced to almost zero.
Israel has had ample warning of what will happen if it continues its campaign of destroying everything necessary to sustain life. The IPC’s Famine Review Committee report on 21 December authoritatively warned of starvation if Israel did not cease destruction and failed to allow humanitarian aid at scale. Israel’s own judge nominated to sit at the international court of justice, Aharon Barak, voted with the court’s majority in favour of “immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance”.
Israel has not changed course. The supplies entering Gaza are woefully short of the minimum calories Israel specified before the war. American airdrops of supplies and an emergency port are a pitiful pretence of a substitute.
Famine is unfolding in Gaza today. We should not have to wait until we count the graves of children to speak its name.

Israel-Gaza war: US condemns ‘cynical’ Russia and China veto of ceasefire deal; Israel to go into Rafah ‘with or without US support’ – as it happened,2024-03-22,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/22/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-gaza-ceasefire-resolution-un-security-council-benjamin-netanyahu-antony-blinken-latest-updates,"This live blog is now closed. For more on the US’s vetoed UN resolution, you can read our latest reporting:
Asked what the US was trying to achieve with draft resolution that was put forward at the UN earlier today, Antony Blinken said the resolution received “very strong” support but was “cynically vetoed” by Russia and China.
The US secretary of state said the US was trying to show the international community “a sense of urgency” about getting a ceasefire.
Here’s a recap of the latest developments:
At least 32,070 Palestinians have been killed and 74,298 have been injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures from Gaza’s health ministry on Friday.
A US resolution urging a ceasefire in Gaza linked to a hostage deal has been vetoed by Russia and China in the UN security council. Eleven council members voted for the resolution on Friday morning; Russia, China and Algeria voted against it and Guyana abstained. As permanent security council members the Russian and Chinese votes counted as vetoes. The US’s critics, including Russia, noted the text did not explicitly use the word “call” in terms of a ceasefire. It also implied the ceasefire would be conditional on the release of all hostages.
The UN security council is expected to vote on Saturday on a new draft resolution that seeks an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, according to reports. The vote on the resolution, expected at 10am local time (1400 GMT), “demands an immediate ceasefire” for the ongoing Muslim holy month of Ramadan that leads “to a permanent sustainable ceasefire” respected by all sides, AFP reported, citing diplomatic sources.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said an Israeli offensive into the southern Gaza town of Rafah would risk “further isolating” Israel and damage its long-term security. Speaking as he left Israel on a short visit during his sixth Middle East trip since the start of the war, Blinken told reporters he had “candid conversations” with officials including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior ministers.
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel remained determined to send troops into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians are sheltering, and would do so without US backing if necessary. “I told him that I hope we would do this with US support but if necessary – we will do it alone,” Netanyahu said after his meeting with US secretary of state Antony Blinken.
The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said there was no way for civilians to escape the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, where Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to send troops as Washington presses for more humanitarian aid. “There is nowhere for these people to go and be safe,” Harris told reporters on Friday.
The leaders of Ireland, Spain, Malta and Slovenia have agreed to take the first steps towards recognising a Palestinian state. The prime ministers of the four countries released a joint statement indicating their “readiness to recognise Palestine and said that we would do so when it can make a positive contribution and the circumstances are right.”
The UK home secretary, David Cameron, has accused Israel of demanding the closure of a key aid crossing into Gaza, in a clash with a British-born government spokesperson that has reportedly resulted in the official’s suspension. The spokesperson, Eylon Levy, whom Israeli media reported as having been suspended, had tweeted Lord Cameron suggesting Israel was not placing any obstacles in the delivery of aid.
The Israeli military’s spokesperson said its forces have detained hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, including a number of security officials and military commanders, during its extended raid into Gaza’s main hospital. Hamas and medical staff deny that the hospital is used for military purposes or to shelter fighters. In recent days, Hamas spokespeople have said that the dead announced in previous Israeli statements were not fighters but patients and displaced people and have accused Israel of war crimes.
Palestine has condemned Israel’s declaration that an 800 hectare (1,977 acres) section of the Israeli-occupied West Bank is state land. The Israeli government announced Friday it was confiscating the land in the occupied West Bank, which activists called the largest such seizure in decades. The Palestinian ministry of foreign affairs said the latest move was “a continuation of the extermination and displacement of our people from their homeland.
People living in Gaza are facing exorbitant food prices as more than 1 million residents of the Palestinian territory face famine. Aid officials have referred to Israel’s siege of Gaza as “man-made starvation”, with the territory facing the threat of mass deaths from famine in the coming weeks. Children are already dying from hunger. But an Israeli official on Friday denied that people in Gaza are suffering from starvation.
Hundreds of worshippers were “blocked” from reaching the al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem by Israeli forces on Friday, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. Al Aqsa, Islam’s third-holiest shrine, is a focus of Palestinian statehood hopes and is also revered by Jews as vestige of their two ancient temples. Israeli controls on access have often stoked political friction, especially during Ramadan.
The head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine (Unrwa) has welcomed Finland’s decision to resume funding to the agency. All Nordic countries are now supporting Unrwa, Philippe Lazzarini said, in addition to Canada and Australia, while several Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia have increased funding. Portugal also said  it would give €10m ($10.89m/£8.6m) to Unrwa as a one-off contribution intended to provide food, medicine, and humanitarian aid to Palestinians.
The UN security council is expected to vote on Saturday on a new draft resolution that seeks an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, according to reports.
The vote on the resolution, led in part by Algeria, the Arab nation currently on the 15-member Security Council, is expected at 10am local time (1400 GMT), AFP reported, citing diplomatic sources.
Three European nations – Malta, Slovenia and Switzerland – are co-sponsoring the resolution, along with Mozambique, Guyana and Sierra Leone.
The draft resolution, seen by AFP, “demands an immediate ceasefire” for the ongoing Muslim holy month of Ramadan that leads “to a permanent sustainable ceasefire” respected by all sides. It also demands both the “immediate and unconditional” release of hostages seized in the 7 October attack by Hamas and humanitarian access in the battered Gaza Strip.
The US has indicated it may veto the new draft resolution, it writes.
The head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine (Unrwa) has welcomed the news that Finland will resume funding to the agency.
Finland was one of 16 major donors that suspended payments after Israel accused a dozen Unrwa of involvement in the 7 October Hamas attack. The UN agency denies the charge and says no substantial evidence has been provided to support the allegation.
Finland’s decision today means that all Nordic countries are now supporting Unrwa, its head Philippe Lazzarini wrote on social media.
Countries including Canada, Australia and Sweden have also restored funding to Unrwa, while several Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia have increased funding.
With #Finland decision today to resume funding to @UNRWA, all Nordic countries are now supporting the Agency & its lifeline activities for #Palestine Refugees in #Gaza & across the region. 🇩🇰🇫🇮 🇮🇸🇳🇴🇸🇪 thank you for standing by UNRWA at this extremely critical time.@DanishMFA…
A rival draft resolution favoured by African states has been circulating that is more explicit about an immediate ceasefire, but this will not be put to the vote on Friday.
France’s ambassador to the UN, Nicolas de Rivière, has said an alternative draft championed by the non-permanent members of the security council, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Ramadan, “will come to the table and put to the vote”. He said:
We need a ceasefire and then talks.
But such are the entrenched divisions in the security council that this resolutionis also likely to be killed – this time by a US veto, potentially the fourth of this conflict. For many observers the episode will confirm that the security council is simply broken.
We reported earlier that the leaders of Ireland, Spain, Malta and Slovenia have agreed to take the first steps towards recognising a Palestinian state. We now have a joint statement from the prime ministers of the four countries.
The statement says that the prime ministers met in the margins of the European Council to share views on the situation in Gaza and the Middle East, and that they are agreed on the “urgent need for an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of hostages and a rapid, massive and sustained increase of humanitarian aid into Gaza.” The statement continues:
We are agreed that the only way to achieve lasting peace and stability in the region is through implementation of a two-state solution, with Israeli and Palestinian States living side-by-side, in peace and security.
We discussed together our readiness to recognise Palestine and said that we would do so when it can make a positive contribution and the circumstances are right.
Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz has posted about his meeting with US secretary of state Antony Blinken in Tel Aviv, saying he “conveyed the imperative of completing the mission in Gaza, including Rafah”.
Gantz, a key political rival of Benjamin Netanyahu, said he reiterated his “profound appreciation” for the US’s continued support for Israel during their meeting.
I met today with US Secretary of State @SecBlinken. I reiterated my profound appreciation for the continued support for Israel and deep commitment to Israel’s security. I conveyed the imperative of completing the mission in Gaza, including Rafah, to dismantle terrorist Hamas…
An Israeli official has denied that people in Gaza are suffering from starvation, despite aid groups warning that virtually every resident in the Palestinian territory is struggling to get enough food.
Aid officials have referred to Israel’s siege of Gaza as “man-made starvation”, with the territory facing the threat of mass deaths from famine in the coming weeks. Children are already dying from hunger.
But Col Moshe Tetro, the head of the Israeli army unit responsible for the delivery of humanitarian aid, told reporters at Gate 96, a new entry point for delivering supplies to the northern area:
As much as we know, by our analysis, there is no starvation in Gaza. There is a sufficient amount of food entering Gaza every day.
Tetro claimed Israel was “doing everything we can to enlarge the capacity of humanitarian aid going into Gaza,” instead blaming “bottlenecks” on international aid groups which he said lacked capacity to distribute supplies inside the territory.
ActionAid has described the failure of the US resolution urging a ceasefire in Gaza at the UN security council as a disappointment, and urged countries to “stop playing politics with people’s lives”.
In a statement, the organisation said:
It is disappointing to see the UN security council yet again fail to take seriously its mandate to maintain peace and promote human rights by refusing to come together and determine that an immediate, unconditional ceasefire is imperative, when we know this is desperately needed to put an end to almost six months of bloodshed in Gaza.
With children already dying of hunger and experts warning that famine is imminent in North and Gaza Governorates, where 70% of people are experiencing catastrophic hunger, all efforts must continue to secure an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. It is the only way to stop the devastating death toll climbing any higher and ensure enough life-saving aid can be safely and effectively delivered at scale. It’s time to stop playing politics with people’s lives, the people of Gaza can’t afford to wait any longer.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said his discussions with Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his war cabinet today focused on three things: the hostage negotiations, humanitarian assistance, and Rafah.
Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv.:
There were important, candid conversations to have at a critical time.
I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli War Cabinet in Tel Aviv to discuss efforts to get more aid into Gaza and get hostages out.More aid is getting in, but it’s not enough. I emphasized that Israel must make this a priority. pic.twitter.com/gw0tp9VvzB
The US state department has released a readout of the meeting between its secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his war cabinet in Tel Aviv.
Blinken briefed Israel’s war cabinet members on “his consultations in Jeddah and Cairo about efforts to achieve lasting peace and security for Israel, the Palestinian people, and the broader region,” state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.
Blinken “reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to Israel’s security and the lasting defeat of Hamas, including in Rafah,” and discussed efforts to reach an agreement for a ceasefire to allow for the release of hostages and enable “a surge in humanitarian assistance,” he said, adding:
Secretary Blinken emphasized the need to protect civilians in Gaza and increase and sustain humanitarian assistance, including through both land and sea routes.
Asked what the US was trying to achieve with draft resolution that was put forward at the UN earlier today, Antony Blinken said the resolution received “very strong” support but was “cynically vetoed” by Russia and China.
The US secretary of state said the US was trying to show the international community “a sense of urgency” about getting a ceasefire.

Israel’s attempt to destroy Unrwa is part of its starvation strategy in Gaza | Kenneth Roth,2024-03-26,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/26/israel-unrwa-palestine,"This attack could not come at a worse time for Palestinians. Hunger is widespread in Gaza, and famine is projected in the north by May
Israel’s vendetta against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (Unrwa) illustrates the callousness with which Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government has fought the war in Gaza. It also reflects an effort to use Hamas’s 7 October attack as an opportunity for demographic re-engineering.
Unrwa established by the UN general assembly in December 1949 to address the 700,000 Palestinian refugees whom Israeli troops had forced from their homes during the war that led to the creation of the state of Israel in May 1948. Palestinians refer to this expulsion as the nakba, or catastrophe. Today, Unrwa provides education, healthcare and social services to the surviving refugees and their descendants. They number nearly 7 million, scattered among Jordan, Lebanon and Syria as well as the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.
In January 2024, the Israeli government alleged that 12 members of Unrwa’s staff had taken part in the 7 October attack. Although Israel has been slow to provide evidence, Unrwa immediately dismissed 10 of the 12 (the other two were said to be dead) and vowed to hold accountable anyone implicated in the attack. The UN also launched an investigation. These steps are exactly what a responsible agency should take.
But the Israeli government saw a broader opportunity. It distributed “intelligence reports” that were said to show that 10% of Unrwa’s staff had unspecified “ties” to Islamist militant groups in Gaza. Israel then pressed governments to suspend funding for Unrwa, which many did, including the United States, Unrwa’s largest funder, and Britain. Some of these governments, including those of the EU, Canada and Australia, have now at least partially resumed funding. Britain and others are awaiting a report on the UN’s internal investigation. The budget deal earlier this month that kept the US government funded through the end of September barred any US funding of Unrwa for a year. (US military aid and arms sales continue, even as Israel bombs and starves Palestinian civilians.)
This attack on Unrwa could not come at a worse time for the Palestinian civilians of Gaza. As has been widely reported, hunger is widespread in Gaza, and famine is projected in the north by May if current trends persist.
With Unrwa’s 13,000 employees in Gaza, “No other entity has the capacity to deliver the scale and breadth of assistance that 2.2 million people in Gaza urgently need,” according to UN leaders. Eight of the biggest private humanitarian agencies working in Gaza said: “The plain reality is that Unrwa’s humanitarian role in this crisis is indispensable and cannot remotely be replaced by any other aid organization.”
Destroying Unrwa thus furthers the Netanyahu government’s starvation strategy for Gaza. Since the siege it imposed on 7 October, the Israeli government has been letting in just enough food to avoid widespread deaths but nowhere near enough to alleviate hunger or to dim the prospects of famine. This past weekend, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, visited the Egyptian side of the Gaza border and saw “long lines of blocked relief trucks waiting to be let into Gaza”. Israel’s understaffed, convoluted procedures for inspecting aid trucks can take three weeks, with trucks often rejected for carrying a single innocuous item that Israel deems of military value, forcing them to start the process all over again.
Israel has allowed much-publicized airdrops and sea delivery of food, but they amount to a tiny fraction of what is needed. Only land deliveries can provide the scale of food required. Unrwa’s delivery system is indispensable for those deliveries.
A land delivery that Israel organized without Unrwa in February ended in disaster, with more than 100 killed and hundreds more wounded when Israeli troops opened fire at hungry people desperate for food, contributing to panic. As some governments resumed Unrwa funding, averting the agency’s potential shutdown, Israel said it would prevent Unrwa from delivering aid to northern Gaza, where, because it is most distant from the two open southern entrances, the need is most dire. The World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Israel was “denying starving people the ability to survive”.
Israel’s obstruction flouts the UN security council’s demand that it lift “all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale”. That blockage is a war crime, as the international criminal court prosecutor Karim Khan has warned. It also contravenes the international court of justice’s order in its preliminary genocide ruling, which, fueling further Israel’s animosity, relied in part on evidence provided by Unrwa.
Israel also hopes to destroy Unrwa because the government naively believes that Palestinian refugees would then somehow forget that they are Palestinian refugees and stop insisting on a right to return. Many would not exercise that right but others would. Israel denies this right not only for return to Israel within its 1967 borders but also for return to the occupied Palestinian territory – to Palestine.
Israeli partisans suggest that the passage of time since 1948 should lead us to forgive and forget its criminal forced deportation, that Palestinian refugees should resettle elsewhere and abandon their hopes of return. But even Moshe Dayan, the legendary Israeli general, realized that “Palestinians would never forget the nakba or stop dreaming of returning to their homes”.
To justify their rejection of Palestinian refugees, Israeli partisans make various unfounded arguments. They assert that only the people who were forced out of Israel in 1948 – few of whom are still alive – should be considered refugees, not their descendants.
But it is common for descendants of refugees to be considered refugees. That is the case for Rohingya from Myanmar in Bangladesh, Somalis in Kenya, Afghans in Pakistan, Sahrawis in Algeria, Bhutanese in Nepal, and others. This multigenerational understanding is a prerequisite for many governments to accept refugees because of the governments’ regrettable but real reluctance to contemplate resettlement if the need for a refuge persists, as it often does.
The partisans also complain that Palestinian refugees should be resettled elsewhere the way some other refugees are. But most refugees flee ongoing persecution or war and do not want to return; for them, resettlement is the best option. But many Palestinian refugees do want to return. They see their compatriots in Israel and Palestine and want to join them. They are barred only by the Israeli government. Refugee status should maximize the welfare of refugees, not serve as a tool for governments to rid themselves of an unwanted population.
Moreover, it is hardly unprecedented for refugees to seek a temporary but not a permanent safe haven. That is what many Ukrainian refugees want now that the Russian invasion has stalled.
The attack on Unrwa is best understood as part of Israel’s quest to alter the demographics of the land it seeks to control. The population of the territory from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea is currently divided roughly equally between Jews and Palestinians. The obvious way for Israel to maintain its Jewish majority would be to allow a Palestinian state, but Netanyahu opposes that. Israel might continue to rule by repressing and disenfranchising millions of Palestinians in the occupied territory, but that has rightly been condemned as apartheid and prompted calls for equal rights for all in what has become a “one-state reality”.
Some Israeli leaders see an ugly third way out of this conundrum – reducing the number of Palestinians. By starving Palestinians in Gaza and destroying much of the housing and infrastructure, Netanyahu seems to want to render Gaza unlivable. That would be consistent with the calls of his rightwing ministers for mass deportation from Gaza – an effort to wipe 2.2 million Palestinians from the demographic balance sheet.
Certainly Netanyahu does not want to make the demographics worse by offering any sustenance to Palestinian refugees who might want to return – even to Palestine. Destroying Unrwa is part of that awful plan. No funder should join it.

"Australian officials scrambled to understand allegations before Unrwa funding suspended, documents show",2024-03-28,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/28/australia-unrwa-funding-pause-documents-october-7-israel-gaza-war,"Exclusive: Dfat official said there was ‘precious nothing in the public domain’ on claims against aid agency hours before pause announced
Australian officials scrambled to “understand what the allegations are” against Unrwa staff and complained of “precious nothing in the public domain” hours before the government suspended funding to the “vital” aid agency.
New documents obtained by Guardian Australia show how the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade rushed to gather information after Israel alleged 12 Unrwa staffers were involved in the 7 October Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel.
The emails shed light on some of the internal discussions that occurred prior to the government’s decision in late January to pause $6m in emergency top-up funding to the agency, although some parts of the documents are redacted.
Just two weeks earlier, a senior Dfat official had described Unrwa as “the largest provider of humanitarian assistance in Gaza” with a distribution network that was “vital for assistance to reach those in need”.
The foreign minister, Penny Wong, announced on Saturday 27 January that the $6m in top-up funding to Unrwa would be paused “temporarily”, after similar moves by other countries including the United States.
Emails obtained under freedom of information laws show the Australian embassy in Washington DC quickly relayed to Canberra the US decision to suspend funds to Unrwa, pending investigations. That occurred on Friday 26 January US time, or early 27 January Australian time.

The Australian ambassador to the UN, James Larsen, advised Canberra that he had “requested further info from Unrwa” and would “engage closely” with Australia’s allies and like-minded countries “for views/reactions”.
Marc Innes-Brown, a Dfat first assistant secretary responsible for the Middle East and Africa division, replied: “Thanks James. We are trying to understand what the allegations are – precious nothing in the public domain. Good to know what they are.”
Larsen promised to “continue to follow up” with Unrwa. He later confirmed he and a colleague were due to speak with the head of Unrwa, Philippe Lazzarini, early on the Saturday US time.
“Please advise any points you would like raised,” Larsen told colleagues.
Hours later, Wong issued a statement saying Australia was “deeply concerned” by the allegations and would “temporarily pause disbursement of recently announced funding”.
She welcomed Unrwa’s “immediate response, including terminating contracts and launching an investigation”.
The newly released documents show that shortly after Wong’s statement, Dfat sent an urgent request to Australian diplomats around the world, including in Europe, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Middle East.
The diplomatic cable requested that Australia’s diplomatic missions compile reports “on reactions to allegations some Unrwa staff were involved in the 7 October terror attacks”.
“Some 12,000 Palestinians are employed by Unrwa in Gaza alone and an estimated 1.4 million Palestinians in Gaza are currently sheltering in Unrwa facilities,” said the cable drafted on 27 January.
It would take another seven weeks for Australia to reinstate the $6m in funding to Unrwa, after similar moves by Canada, Sweden and the European Union.

The Israeli government, which has long raised concerns about Unrwa, alleges infiltration by Hamas and other militants and argues the agency cannot be part of the solution in Gaza.
Israel is no longer approving Unrwa food convoys to the north of Gaza, where the threat of famine is highest.
The $6m in Australian funding was paused not long after Wong announced it on her trip to the Middle East in mid-January.
Internal emails from that earlier period show Dfat’s humanitarian coordinator, Beth Delaney, asked Wong and the international development minister, Pat Conroy, to approve new funding to “respond to urgent and ongoing humanitarian needs resulting from the Hamas-Israel conflict”.
“This drawdown would form part of package which includes additional support for refugee programs in Jordon and Lebanon at a time of increasing regional instability,” Delaney wrote on 10 January.
Delaney cited figures showing 1.9 million people, or 85% of the population of Gaza, were internally displaced and 2.2 million people were “at imminent risk of famine”.
“The humanitarian situation is dire and there are indications of escalating violence in the West Bank,” she wrote.
“[Unrwa’s] distribution network is vital for assistance to reach those in need.”
In the previously secret advice, Delaney said Australia would “continue to seek additional assurances to enable further confidence the risks associated with humanitarian delivery are being managed given the difficult operating environment in Gaza, specifically”.
Guardian Australia’s FOI application sought documents about the decisions to top up Unrwa funding in mid-January and then to pause it, including any assessment of the allegations against the agency.
Dfat redacted some parts of the material, citing potential damage to Australia’s international relations and the need to protect material communicated in confidence.

The Guardian view on the IDF’s killing of aid workers: a grim milestone in Gaza | Editorial,2024-04-02,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-idfs-killing-of-aid-workers-a-grim-milestone-in-gaza,"The attack on a relief convoy, an assassination on diplomatic premises and a devastating hospital raid show Israel does not heed allies or critics
Even by the standards of a conflict that has killed almost 33,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and created the entirely human-made famine taking hold in Gaza, Israel has crossed multiple lines in just a couple of days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) killed seven foreign aid workers, including a dual US/Canadian citizen, three Britons as well as team members from Poland and Australia, and their Palestinian driver, as they attempted to meet some portion of the desperate need. Gaza’s chief hospital, al-Shifa, lies in ruins after a two-week IDF raid. Israel says no civilians died there; the World Health Organization disagrees. And it has killed the Revolutionary Guards Corps commander Mohammad Reza Zahedi and his deputy at an Iranian diplomatic mission in Syria – reviving fears of a wider regional conflagration, and setting a dangerous precedent in targeting diplomatic premises.
Israel and its armed forces boast of following international law. A senior Tory has said that British government lawyers believe Israel has broken it. The former Israeli president Reuven Rivlin has warned that it is “one step away from international ostracism”. While the rhetoric of Israel’s allies has been slowly hardening, and their diplomatic position shifting, polls suggest that the public mood is moving faster. The World Central Kitchen workers were in clearly marked cars, in a “deconflicted” zone, heading away from an aid warehouse, having coordinated movements with the IDF. The convoy was struck not once but three times, killing the fleeing survivors.
Unusually, Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged IDF responsibility, while calling it “unintentional” and adding: “This happens in wartime.” The deaths of the innocent are happening in this war again and again and again. Death on this scale cannot be written off as a series of unfortunate accidents. It is a choice in a conflict that far exceeds any reasonable attempt to pursue those responsible for the horrific Hamas attack on 7 October.
Asking Israel to investigate these deaths, as the UK has done, is absurd given Israel’s history of obfuscation in such cases and avoidance of accountability. (It is banning Al Jazeera under a new law allowing ministers to shut down foreign media organisations.) It is uncomfortable to dwell on foreign lives lost when thousands of Palestinian deaths have received little scrutiny, but the destruction of the relief system is killing many more. Aid ships have turned back in the wake of the attack. Israel wants to dismantle the Palestinian relief agency Unrwa, the only entity capable of responding at scale.
On the international front, Israel seems to have gambled that Iran, and its “axis of resistance”, are too weak to risk a broader confrontation, given its calibration to date. But Tehran will seek to re-establish deterrence and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has already vowed revenge.
In the face of growing unpopularity at home, with tens of thousands of Israelis joining the families of hostages to demand his removal, Mr Netanyahu sees his best hope of survival as a forever war. Israel’s allies are increasingly reluctant to defend his actions, but they won’t stop them either. What would it take to turn US lamentation into action and stop Joe Biden greenlighting an $18bn deal for F-15 fighter jets? Where are the lines now? What will it take for Israel’s allies to say: no more – and show they mean it?

Australian international court judge calls for Israel to suspend Gaza military operation,2024-04-02,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/02/australia-icj-judge-hilary-charlesworth-israel-suspend-gaza-idf-military-operation,"Hilary Charlesworth further explains ruling calling on Israel to permit aid deliveries to Palestinians, saying ICJ was too ‘opaque’ in its wording
She is the only Australian woman to have served on the international court of justice. Now, just months after the Australian government supported her re-election to the top UN court, Hilary Charlesworth has taken a significant stand: calling for Israel to suspend its military operations in Gaza.
Charlesworth, a distinguished international lawyer who replaced the late Australian judge James Crawford on the ICJ, believes a suspension is required to ensure enough aid reaches civilians, while also cautioning that such a step “only partly addresses the risk of destruction of the Palestinians in Gaza”.
Charlesworth expressed this position after joining 15 other judges last Thursday in unanimously ordering Israel to urgently ensure “the unhindered provision at scale by all concerned of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance” including food and water.
The declaration, posted on the ICJ website alongside statements from several other judges, is not so much a dissenting opinion as an additional explanation of her position.
Charlesworth said the ICJ’s new orders included a call for Israel to ensure “its military does not commit acts” that breach the genocide convention “including by preventing, through any action, the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian assistance”.
But Charlesworth, who has a doctor of juridical science from Harvard Law School, said this “elliptical” phrasing was “drafted in such opaque terms that it fails to provide clear guidance to the parties”.

“Instead of employing [these] convoluted terms … in my view the court should have made it explicit that Israel is required to suspend its military operations in the Gaza Strip, precisely because this is the only way to ensure that basic services and humanitarian assistance reach the Palestinian population,” she wrote.
Charlesworth noted that the ICJ did not have power to order measures directed at entities not bound by its statute – a likely reference to Hamas – but said South Africa also had responsibilities given it had brought the legal dispute before the court.
“In my view it is open to the court to order both Israel and South Africa to take all reasonable measures within their power to achieve an immediate and sustained humanitarian ceasefire, which would serve to preserve the rights in dispute between them,” she wrote.
The ICJ has yet to make a substantive ruling on South Africa’s allegation that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, while Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has said the claim “is not only false, it’s outrageous”.
In January the ICJ issued a provisional ruling that Palestinians in the Gaza Strip had a “plausible” right to be protected from acts of genocide, and it ordered Israel to “take all measures within its power to prevent the commission” of genocidal acts.
South Africa returned to the court last month with a request to issue new provisional orders on the basis that widespread starvation was a “change in the situation in Gaza”.
Israel rejected “in the strongest terms” any claims that incidents of starvation in Gaza were a direct result of its deliberate acts and omissions, and maintains that its military operations are a legitimate response to Hamas’s 7 October attack on southern Israel.

On Thursday, however, the ICJ agreed that the recent developments in Gaza were “exceptionally grave” and said “famine is setting in”.
Rita Jabri Markwell, a lawyer with the Australian Muslim Advocacy Network, said it was significant that Charlesworth had indicated Israel should explicitly be ordered to suspend its military operations.
“The Australian government is at odds with Judge Charlesworth’s opinion because it has only made qualified calls for a ceasefire and has not applied a single consequence to Israel as required by international law,” she said.
Since December, the Australian government has called for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in Gaza and the release of hostages, leading to a “sustainable ceasefire” that “cannot be one-sided”.
The foreign minister, Penny Wong, has said ICJ orders are binding and that Hamas should also comply with the UN security council demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.
“And we should be able to come together to demand that the Netanyahu government comply with the security council’s demand that all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale are removed,” Wong told fellow senators last Tuesday.
Wong said during the ICJ re-election campaign last year: “A vote for Judge Charlesworth is a vote to uphold an international legal system that is representative, that is robust, that is fair. It’s a system that serves us all.”

Sunak calls for investigation as British aid workers killed in Israeli airstrike named,2024-04-03,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/02/israeli-airstrike-gaza-british-citizens-aid-workers-killed,"PM demands ‘transparent investigation’ from Benjamin Netanyahu’s government as names emerge of three Britons killed in Gaza
Rishi Sunak has called for an urgent investigation into the deaths of three British aid workers working for the charity World Central Kitchen who were killed by an Israeli airstrike that hit an aid convoy in Gaza.
WCK confirmed that British victims John Chapman, 57, James “Jim” Henderson, 33, and James Kirby, 47, who were working for the charity’s security team, were among seven of its staff killed.
The team’s leader, Lalzawmi “Zomi” Frankcom, 43, an Australian national, also died, along with American-Canadian dual citizen Jacob Flickinger, 33, Polish national Damian Sobol, 35, and Palestinian Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha, 25.
The UK prime minister said far too many aid workers and ordinary civilians had lost their lives in Gaza during a conversation with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Tuesday.
David Cameron, the foreign secretary, spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Israel Katz, and requested an urgent explanation of the incident.
A Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister “was appalled by the killing of aid workers, including three British nationals, in an airstrike in Gaza … and demanded a thorough and transparent independent investigation into what happened”.
The spokesperson added: “The prime minister said far too many aid workers and ordinary civilians have lost their lives in Gaza and the situation is increasingly intolerable.
“The UK expects to see immediate action by Israel to end restrictions on humanitarian aid, deconflict with the UN and aid agencies, protect civilians and repair vital infrastructure like hospitals and water networks.
“The prime minister reiterated that Israel’s rightful aim of defeating Hamas would not be achieved by allowing a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.”
In a post on X, Lord Cameron said he underlined to Katz that the deaths of the humanitarian workers were “completely unacceptable” and that Israel must make “major changes to ensure safety of aid workers on the ground”.
Andrew Mitchell, a Foreign Office minister, summoned the Israeli ambassador over the incident and requested “a quick and transparent investigation, shared with the international community, and full accountability”.
The group of aid workers had been travelling in two armoured vehicles marked with the charity’s logo, according to a statement released early on Tuesday.
World Central Kitchen said it was suspending operations in the Palestinian territory.
Earlier, Sunak told broadcasters during a visit to north-east England on Tuesday morning: “We are asking Israel to investigate what happened urgently, because clearly there are questions that need to be answered.
“My thoughts are with [the victims’] friends and family,” the prime minister added. “They are doing fantastic work bringing alleviation to the suffering that many are experiencing in Gaza.”
Keir Starmer condemned the strike and called for a full investigation and immediate ceasefire.
“Reports of the death of British nationals – among others from World Central Kitchen – in an Israeli strike on Gaza are horrifying,” the Labour leader said.
“Our thoughts are with the families of all of those killed. This war must stop now. Far too many innocent people have died in this conflict and more than a million are facing starvation.”
The Foreign Office said it was working to support the families. Netanyahu said the aid workers were killed by an “unintended strike” by Israeli forces.
The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: “This is a war machine totally out of control in Gaza.” He said more aid workers had been killed there “than in any other conflict”.
Egeland said he had visited Gaza recently and ate meals with the WCK. “There is no nobler task,” he said. “I saw the good work of these very compassionate people helping the civilian population.”
Alicia Kearns, the Tory MP who chairs the UK’s foreign affairs select committee, said: “Humanitarian agencies must be given the assurances they need that their people will be protected.” UK-based aid agencies have condemned the strike.
The UK-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians said it was a “horrific attack” that demonstrated there was “no safe place in Gaza, whether you are Palestinian, British or any other nationality”.
It added: “Gaza is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be an aid worker right now.”
The Israel Defense Forces “expressed the deepest condolences” to the families of the aid workers and said it was “reviewing the incident at the highest levels”.
“As a professional military committed to international law, we are committed to examining our operations thoroughly and transparently,” an IDF spokesperson said.
“The incident will be investigated in the fact-finding and assessment mechanism, an independent, professional and expert body.”

Aid groups demand Israel improve measures to keep their workers safe,2024-04-04,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/04/aid-groups-demand-israel-improve-measures-to-keep-their-workers-safe,"Humanitarian organisations working in Gaza say Israeli forces must stick to deconfliction procedures
Aid organisations working in Gaza have said they are demanding the Israeli military improve and adhere to security procedures intended to keep their workers safe, following Israeli airstrikes that killed all seven members of a convoy of humanitarian workers from World Central Kitchen (WCK).
“What happened is above all else a tragedy, but I would be surprised if coordination [with Israeli forces] continues in the same way it did in the past,” said one aid worker from a leading humanitarian organisation, who asked not to be named.
They said their organisation was constantly pushing for improvements to the deconfliction system, including improved lines of communication and “command and control” within the Israeli military.
A second senior aid official at a different organisation said they felt attacks on aid workers were due to “a loophole in the chain of command within the Israeli army”.
“We do this everywhere in the world: every time we move into a dangerous area we coordinate to deconflict with the army in charge. We are doing our job. What the Israeli army needs to do is theirs – which means respect the laws of war,” they said.
WCK said in a statement after the incident that the convoy had coordinated its movements with the Israeli military, but was struck on a coastal road while leaving a warehouse in Deir al-Balah, south of Gaza City.
“The deconfliction system works if Israel wants it to. We want Israel to abide by the existing system, where we notify them and they don’t hit us,” said Bushra Khalid, Oxfam’s policy adviser for the occupied Palestinian territories.
“I don’t think it’s a problem of the system. I think there’s an unwillingness to abide by the system and by the locations provided,” she added.
Israeli authorities, including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, labelled the strikes on the WCK convoy “unintentional” and have promised to investigate. But the attack raised fears and insecurity for aid groups working in Gaza. Multiple organisations, including WCK, have ceased operations there citing risks to worker safety, further curtailing aid at a time when the global authority on food security believes famine is imminent, if not already happening, in northern Gaza.
WCK was one of few aid organisations permitted by Israeli authorities to deliver food to northern Gaza. It said before suspending operations that it had delivered 35m meals in the enclave.
“Children trapped in Gaza are dying of hunger while Israel obstructs aid and kills aid workers – this is why children are dying of starvation. This is not a natural disaster,” said Khalidi. “The burden is on Israel to avoid harming us. We make ourselves visible when delivering aid so we protect our teams and the people in Gaza where we serve.”
But, she added, an internal debate persists about whether it is safe or not to share the locations of their guesthouses and offices with Israeli authorities for fear staff will be targeted.

The strikes in the early hours of Tuesday follow a pattern of attacks on humanitarian facilities and aid workers in Gaza since 7 October.
Aid groups working in the enclave provide the coordinates of their offices, residences and the movements of their aid convoys to Israeli forces via a system of deconfliction, which operates through the UN.
An international outcry after the strikes on the WCK convoy, aid workers hope, will force a change in how they are treated on the ground.
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and Cogat, a body within the Israeli military that oversees operations in Gaza, have been contacted for comment.
Last November, a convoy from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) carrying medical supplies for hospitals came under fire, damaging two trucks and wounding a driver, after the organisation had provided details to Israeli forces. The IDF said they were unwilling to comment on the incident without the exact coordinates of the attack. The same month, the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said its guesthouse in Rafah was also struck shortly after staff had left.
In January, Israeli naval forces struck a guesthouse used by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Medical Aid for Palestinians in the coastal area of al-Mawasi. IRC said it had shared coordinates of the building through the UN deconfliction process and that the IDF had provided “six different explanations as to why the airstrike took place”, without providing any clarity about the attack.
A month later, Doctors Without Borders said one of its guesthouses in the same area was struck by Israeli naval fire and Unwra said that Israeli naval gunfire hit an aid truck as it attempted to cross the northern Gaza Strip.
“This is not an isolated incident,” said Jamie McGoldrick, UN humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian Territories, of the strikes on the WCK convoy. “As of 20 March, at least 196 humanitarians had been killed in the OPT [Occupied Palestinian Territory] since October 2023. This is nearly three times the death toll recorded in any single conflict in a year.”
During a previous round of conflict in 2014, when Israeli forces also conducted a ground invasion of Gaza, a physical operations room with aid groups was set up early in the conflict, according to a humanitarian worker. This allowed organisations to relay details of aid convoys and locations of shelters or offices in real time and ensure swift deconfliction.
Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant announced following the attack on the WCK convoy that the Israeli military would establish an operations room with aid groups to coordinate distribution, although some aid workers questioned why it had taken six months of war for this to happen.
A staff member from the aid group Anera, which suspended operations in Gaza after the strike on the WCK convoy, was killed in an Israeli strike last month ago, although aid groups said the coordinates of his shelter had been provided to Israeli forces multiple times.
Khalidi pointed to the unprecedented scale of loss in Gaza. “A hundred-and-ninety-six aid workers is an army that could be helping, but they’re dead,” she said. “This is not proportionate, and no distinction is being made here.”

David Cameron warns of Gaza famine as UK sends Royal Navy ship to boost aid effort,2024-04-06,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/06/david-cameron-warns-of-gaza-famine-as-uk-sends-royal-navy-ship-to-boost-aid-effort,"Move to join US-led maritime corridor follows international fury at last week’s killing of seven aid workers
The Royal Navy was ordered into action on Saturday to help supply desperately needed aid to Gaza, as the foreign secretary, David Cameron, warned that the Palestinian people trapped there were on the brink of famine.
With the UK and US governments under intense pressure to halt arms sales to Israel, Downing Street said on Saturday that ministers would instead boost support for a planned new maritime corridor from Cyprus to Gaza, to channel “life-saving aid” by sea to a population in urgent need of basic food supplies.
Announcing the emergency deployment of a Royal Navy vessel and £9.7m in aid, Lord Cameron said: “The situation in Gaza is dire and the prospect of famine is real. We remain committed to getting aid to those who so desperately need it.”
The defence secretary, Grant Shapps, said a navy ship was en route to the eastern Mediterranean.
As part of the operation, first announced by Joe Biden at the beginning of Ramadan last month, the US, UK, EU and other partners will establish a new temporary pier off the coast of Gaza, where aid can be channelled straight into the blockaded territory without the risk of it being sent back at the border. The shipments will be inspected by Israeli officials in Larnaca before setting off.
The move follows a wave of international outrage at the killing last week by Israeli forces of seven aid workers, three of them British, employed by the charity World Central Kitchen (WCK), which had just sent a second ship and tug carrying 400 tonnes of aid – enough for 1m meals – to Gaza after a successful pilot run last month.
The organisation and several other agencies have since suspended operations in the Palestinian territory, increasing the risk of starvation for its 2.3 million people still further.
The WCK deliveries, which were unloaded at a makeshift jetty near the central town of Deir al-Balah that was constructed by volunteers from rubble, are separate to the US-led project for a temporary floating pier, which officials hope will be fully operational by early May.
The announcement on increased aid is unlikely to reduce calls for both the UK and US governments to stop supplying arms to Israel. Many legal experts believe the UK is breaching international humanitarian law with its prosecution of the war on Hamas, which, according to the health ministry in the Islamist-run territory, has led to the deaths of at least 33,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children. With many bodies still trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings, the true figure is likely to be higher.
The Guardian reported last week that Israeli military officials had permitted large numbers of Palestinian civilians to be killed in unguided “dumb” bomb strikes targeting even low-level Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants, based on what intelligence sources said was an AI-driven system that in many cases risked “attacking by mistake”.
Both the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said they were looking into the report.
Israel says it is fighting a war of self-defence against a brutal enemy bent on destroying the state, after Hamas killed more than 1,100 people, the majority civilians, on 7 October last year in cross-border attacks and took at least 250 people hostage to Gaza.
Israel denies blocking aid, saying any shortages are a result of logistics failures by humanitarian organisations or Hamas diverting supplies.
Last week, the Observer reported Alicia Kearns, the Tory MP and chair of the foreign affairs select committee, as saying that the Foreign Office’s own lawyers had concluded that Israel was in breach of international law and that the UK as a result had to halt arms sales. This was not denied by the Foreign Office.
The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, will outline on Sunday how Labour will try to use parliament to pressure the government into releasing the legal advice. Lammy said that the UK government should “unequivocally commit to complying with international law in this conflict, including following the licensing criteria governing arms sales, as well as calling on Israel to implement the provisional measures in the ICJ [international court of justice]’s binding January ruling in full.”
To mark six months since the Hamas attacks, Rishi Sunak toughened his line on Israel, saying that while the UK stood by the state’s right to defend itself, “the whole of the UK is shocked by the bloodshed and appalled by the killing of brave British heroes who were bringing food to those in need”.
Sunak added: “This terrible conflict must end. The hostages must be released. The aid – which we have been straining every sinew to deliver by land, air and sea – must be flooded in. The children of Gaza need a humanitarian pause immediately, leading to a long-term sustainable ceasefire.”
The comments were in stark contrast to those he made a week after 7 October, in which he offered unconditional and permanent support to Israel and failed even to mention innocent Palestinians caught up in the conflict.
The maritime corridor scheme will take several weeks to put into action, carrying the risk of supplying too little relief, too late. While aid experts have welcomed it as a step in the right direction, they said the plan, along with airdrops introduced after more than 100 people were killed at an aid distribution point in February, remains a less effective way of getting aid into Gaza than deliveries by land.
The number of aid lorries entering the territory over the past five months has been far below the 500 a day that entered before the war, and getting assistance to where it is most needed has been made difficult by damaged roads, a lack of fuel, a breakdown of public order and what aid agencies have described as unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles imposed by Israel and a failure by Israeli forces to ensure safe passage.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told Biden last week that Israel would reopen a key land crossing into Gaza, allow more aid through another crossing and open an Israeli port to aid deliveries after a warning in the wake of the aid worker killings that future US support for Israel will depend on it taking concrete action to protect civilians and humanitarians.
The Israeli cabinet’s decision followed briefings by foreign ministry officials who warned that if aid were not increased, Israel would risk sanctions and arms embargos.
The US has also made clear that it strongly opposes Israel’s plans for a ground operation in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah, where a million people are sheltering, not least because of Israel’s “unrealistic plans” to evacuate civilians before an assault.
Although 100 Israelis were freed in a week-long ceasefire at the end of November in exchange for 240 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails, negotiations since aimed at a second, longer truce and the release of the remaining hostages have repeatedly faltered.
 This article was amended on 8 April 2024 to correct a typographical error; the volume of aid being carried in the World Central Kitchen shipment was 400 tonnes, not 400m tonnes as an earlier version said.

‘All we think about is how to stay alive’: the horror of daily life for those trapped in Gaza,2024-04-07,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/07/all-we-think-about-is-how-to-stay-alive-the-horror-of-daily-life-for-those-trapped-in-gaza,"With more than 33,000 dead and a growing famine, some of the people caught up in the conflict speak about their daily struggles merely to exist
Two hundred and fifty calories represents two slices of supermarket wholemeal bread sold in the UK. Twelve per cent of recommended nutrition intake. Today in northern Gaza, already in the grip of a “catastrophic” level of hunger as defined by the UN, it represents an entire day’s calorific intake.
Six months into Israel’s war against Gaza, which followed Hamas’s brutal surprise attack on southern Israel’s border communities on 7 October last year which killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and saw almost 250 ­others taken hostage, acute hunger has become pervasive in the coastal strip.
For those who have money, food is in perilously short supply. For those with none – and with Israel, according to UN officials and other agencies, having obstructed the delivery of humanitarian aid for months – finding sustenance has become a matter of life and death.
According to the IPC, the UN-backed hunger-monitoring mechanism, 1.1 million people, half of Gaza’s population, are expected to live with catastrophic hunger within three months if the violence does not escalate.
“Before the war we were in good health and had strong bodies,” one mother recently told the British-based aid agency Oxfam. “Now, when I look at my children and myself, we have lost so much weight. We try to eat whatever we find, edible plants or herbs, just to survive.”
Another mother of six echoed this account to the World Health Organisation, explaining that in the markets wild plants are mainly available at high prices with “no vegetables, no fruits, no juice… no lentils, no rice, no potatoes or eggplants, nothing”, leaving many to survive by eating mallow, a common leafy weed. In a ruined and besieged Gaza, threatened constantly by bombs, artillery and drones, life is defined by a refrain repeated by many. “I’m still alive. I’m still breathing.”
“I don’t know if I still feel anything other than fear, sadness and frustration,” says Mohammed Mortaja, one of hundreds of thousands who have been displaced to the southern city of Rafah, even now a place under threat of a new Israeli offensive.
“Every morning the sun rises and you are alive. Your daily journey is to remain alive – between the search for water and food and escaping from the bombing and occupation.”
Mortaja says he is completely focused on survival and no longer pays attention to the news. After six long months, hope, too, has been set aside, replaced by a numb sense of dislocation.
“I’m no longer tempted by words like truce or ceasefire. I don’t care about anything – I just search for what can satisfy my hunger and my thirst and I wait anxiously for my death.”
More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, including more than 13,000 children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
In half a year of violent conflict, that in turn followed years of an Israeli blockade of the coastal strip which served more to strengthen Hamas than to undermine it, Gaza is defined today more by what has been lost than what remains of a once-vibrant society.
Apartment blocks and whole neighbourhoods have been flattened. Hospitals have been reduced to ruins, now roamed by dogs and stinking of sewage. Universities have been blown up and agriculture destroyed. Electricity and with it the ability to process potable and waste water has been fatally disrupted, contributing to the rampant spread of disease.
As of last month, satellite images analysed by the United Nations Satellite Centre concluded that 35% of the Gaza Strip’s buildings have been destroyed or damaged in the offensive. Life itself has been atomised as the war has driven over 80 percent of the population of 2.3 million out of their homes to seek shelter mainly in the south in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions.
Aid deliveries have been throttled by Israel’s closure of land crossings into Gaza, while recent air drop operations are limited in scale and have on several occasions led to deaths after problems with parachute failures and aid dropping into the sea.
The question for Gaza is where the war goes from here. An avalanche of international condemnation of Israel for its killing of seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen charity last week in a protracted drone strike that hit their cars, one after the other, follows anger at the high and escalating death toll and a growing famine.
And while Israel, under US pressure following the aid worker deaths, has agreed to open more border crossings to allow in more aid, some international officials, including the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, believe it is too little and too late to prevent starvation.
“Israel and its allies must ensure that aid can now flow freely to avert a famine, and that there will be a protection system for humanitarian workers that guarantees our security. Most of all we need protection for Palestinian civilians, who have been indiscriminately killed during these last six months,” said Jan Egeland, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s secretary general.
Alongside the threat of famine, the biggest question is what happens to Rafah, home to 1.5 million people, which Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that he plans to attack despite the objections of Washington and other allies.
Ahmed Masoud, a Gazan human rights activist now living in Rafah after being displaced six times over the past six months – a typical experience – says he has lost 40 of his friends, his home and his job. Now he fears losing his mental health.
“All we think about is how to stay alive and struggling to get water and food. Once the night comes, we think more about being killed - especially because we hear 24/7 the sound of Israeli warplanes, especially the drones,” says Masoud, who describes a constant battle to keep his mental health which he fears may not survive the war.
“I’m so lucky that I still have my mind and I haven’t lost it yet.”

But Rafah now is no longer a safe zone – though it has never been exempted from airstrikes – and the population says rumours have built of a looming Israeli invasion.
“Everything is destroyed around us. We feel that at any moment now they will enter Rafah,” said another Palestinian living in the city, who did not want to be named. “We are waiting to evacuate Rafah at any moment. We will probably go towards the sea, to the beach.”
Masoud says everyone in Rafah is waiting for an invasion but they do not know where to go.
The corrosive and all-pervading sense of fear has driven those with contacts abroad to issue desperate pleas to borrow money to pay the heavy bribes required by Egyptian “brokers” – sometimes ­amounting to tens of thousands of dollars for a single family – to escape across the border.
“The American administration wants a clear plan to evacuate people to safety. To be honest, I don’t know what ‘safe area’ they’re talking about,” he says. “It’s a really big fear but we’ve got used to being killed, to hearing sad news, so we have nothing to lose. So here we are, waiting for our destiny.”
Despite the growing international pressure to stop the fighting, including the recent passage of a resolution to that effect in the UN Security Council, ceasefire negotiations centred on a release of the dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas – many of whom are believed to have died in captivity – remain stuck despite the scale of the suffering.
Hamas says Israel’s forces must leave Gaza. Israel says it must finish its destruction of Hamas.
Yet despite Israel’s claims to have killed around 13,000 Hamas fighters and dismantled the group’s military capabilities across most of Gaza there is no sign that Hamas is finished, with its fighters regrouping in areas where Israel previously declared victory.
Michael Milshtein, a former high-ranking Israeli military intelligence officer who is an expert in Palestinian studies at Tel Aviv University, says Israel faces two unappealing choices: accept a hostage and ceasefire deal that acknowledges Hamas has survived, or step up the military campaign and conquer Gaza in the hope that Hamas will eventually be destroyed.
He said expectations that the Israeli military’s current approach can destroy Hamas or force it to surrender are “wishful thinking”.
Amos Harel in Israeli newspaper Haaretz was even more blunt, describing a stagnated war, burnt-out troops and an ever-increasing insensitivity to Palestinian lives where “the notion that ‘there are no innocents in Gaza’” is rife among the combat troops.
“Today it is clear to everyone – other than blind followers – that the promises of ‘total victory’ that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu made every other day are totally worthless,” he wrote.
For now, all that can be said with any certainty is that a war launched with unrealistic expectations will drag on longer yet amid Israel’s growing international isolation.
And that those paying the heaviest price are Gaza’s Palestinian civilians.

"Middle East crisis: Israel to join Cairo talks on Gaza truce and hostage release, says official – as it happened",2024-04-07,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/apr/07/middle-east-crisis-live-four-israeli-soldiers-killed-in-khan-younis-as-gaza-war-reaches-six-month-mark,"Israel was previously undecided on whether to attend talks but will now take part in the latest round of negotiations
An Israeli delegation will take part in the latest round of negotiations in Cairo aimed at reaching a truce in the Gaza conflict and a hostage release deal, an Israeli government official said on Sunday.
Israel was previously undecided on whether to attend, an Israeli official said, citing concern that the event would be “more political theatre than actual progress”.
Hamas’s demands include a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, a return of the displaced, and a “serious” exchange deal of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages being held in Gaza.
Israel reportedly said, in a previous round of talks, that ceasefire discussions would falter unless Hamas presented a list of the hostages, including who is alive and who is dead.
Six months on from the start of the war, negotiators are reportedly meeting in Cairo to try to reach a ceasefire deal, which has so far remained elusive despite several high-level attempts. According to some media reports, CIA director Bill Burns and Qatari prime minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani will join negotiators from Egypt, Israel and Hamas. Despite speculation they would not be present, an Israeli government official said on Sunday that an Israeli delegation will take part in the latest round of negotiations in the Egyptian capital. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Sunday, however, that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire with Hamas until the hostages being held in Gaza are released. At the same cabinet meeting, Netanyahu, under intense pressure from the families of hostages still being held captive in Gaza, was quoted as saying: “We are one step away from victory… But the price we paid is painful and heartbreaking.”
A senior Iranian official said on Sunday that none of Israel’s embassies were safe any more, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. Yahya Rahim Safavi, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, was quoted as saying that Tehran viewed confrontation with Israel as a “legitimate and legal right”. He was speaking after a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus on 1 April for which Tehran has vowed retaliation. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said earlier today that preparations had been completed to handle any scenario that may develop with Iran. The minister’s office made the statement after he held an “operational situation assessment” with senior military officers.
World Central Kitchen founder, José Andrés, has raised questions over the Israeli probe into an Israeli strike that killed seven of his staff in Gaza, and warned that Israel’s war in Gaza had become a “war against humanity itself”. “This doesn’t seem like a war against terror. This doesn’t seem any more like a war about defending Israel,” he said. “This really, at this point, seems like a war against humanity itself.”
At least 33,175 Palestinian people have been killed and 75,886 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said. There have been 38 Palestinians killed and 71 injured in the past 24 hours, the ministry said. UN agencies and charities decried the devastating humanitarian impact of Gaza’s war, warning that the situation was “beyond catastrophic” with a faming looming and millions of people at risk of hunger.
The Israeli military has withdrawn all ground troops from the southern Gaza Strip except for one brigade, a military spokesperson said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a “significant force” will continue to operate in the rest of Gaza. “They’ve been on the ground for four months, the word we’re getting is they’re tired, they need to be refit,” US national security council spokesperson John Kirby told ABC’s This Week programme, though he stressed that it was “hard to know exactly what this tells us right now”.

Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels on Sunday said they targeted a “British ship” and two “Israeli” vessels, after a British maritime security firm reported three separate attacks off Yemen’s coast in less than 24 hours.
In a statement posted on social media on Sunday, Huthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said the rebels carried out five military operations during the previous 72 hours.
They include a missile strike against a “British ship (Hope Island) in the Red Sea”.
Missiles also targeted what Saree described as two Israeli ships, MSC GRACE F and MSC GINA.
Israel’s partial withdrawal from the southern Gaza Strip is likely so its troops can “rest and refit”, rather than a move towards a new operation, the White House said on Sunday.
“They’ve been on the ground for four months, the word we’re getting is they’re tired, they need to be refit,” national security council spokesperson John Kirby told ABC’s This Week, though he stressed that it was “hard to know exactly what this tells us right now”.
Kirby spoke hours after Israel, pulled most of its troops out of southern Gaza, including from the city of Khan Younis, according to the military and Israeli media.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a “significant force” will continue to operate in the rest of Gaza. Kirby said he would let the IDF “speak to their operations”.
“As we understand it, and through their public announcements, it is really just about rest and refit for these troops that have been on the ground for four months and not necessarily, that we can tell, indicative of some coming new operation for these troops,” he said.
In Athens, Cyprus’ president, Nikos Christodoulides, has been discussing the alarming increase in Syrian migrants fleeing Lebanon for the Mediterranean island as tensions escalate along the Lebanese-Israeli border.
Over lunch with visiting EU chief, Ursula Von der Leyen, the Cypriot leader appealed for support from Brussels in handling what has been described as an unprecedented surge of refugees embarking on the sea journey from Lebanon.
Last week, 15 boats carrying 800 people made the 10-hour crossing, leaving Cyprus, Christodoulides said, in “a state of serious crisis”.
The influx, seen as a by-product of the ongoing Israeli-Hamas conflict, has stoked fears of Cyprus, the region’s nearest EU member state, being overwhelmed by refugees if the war spreads into Lebanon.
Commenting on the talks, also attended by Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Cyprus’s government spokesperson said: “The main topic of discussion is the management of the recent increased migration flows from Lebanon, and specific ways to prevent this phenomenon through more active involvement of the EU.”
Christodoulides will travel to Lebanon with the island’s interior and foreign ministers on Monday to discuss ways of assisting the country stop the flows.
This weekend Cyprus’s interior minister, Constantinos Ioannou, told the Guardian the country’s refugee reception facilities were at breaking point and called for the EU to help Lebanon in exchange for local authorities stemming the irregular migrant outflows.

UN agencies and charities have decried the devastating humanitarian impact of Gaza’s war in Israel on its six-month mark, warning that the situation was “beyond catastrophic”.
“Six months is an awful milestone,” the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said, warning that “humanity has been all but abandoned”.
The IFRC chief Jagan Chapagain was quoted by AFP as having described the situation as “beyond catastrophic”.
Amid looming famine, he warned that “millions of lives are at risk of hunger”.
“An urgent and unhindered flow of humanitarian aid must be ensured to reach those in need. Not tomorrow, but now.”
It's been six months since the terrible day of violence in Israel.It’s been almost six months of ever-escalating violence in Gaza, where the situation is desperate, and worsening.We @IFRC take no side other than the side of humanity.Six months on, I reiterate my call for:…
IFRC said in a post on X that 18 members of its network – 15 staff and volunteers with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and three from Magen David Adom (MDA) – had been killed since 7 October.
“These deaths are devastating and unacceptable,” Chapagain said on X.
IFRC took “no side other than the side of humanity”, he said, stressing the urgent need to ensure “unhindered access for aid into and to all parts of the Gaza Strip”.
Unicef chief Catherine Russell pointed out that more than 13,000 children were reportedly among those killed.
“Homes, schools and hospitals in ruin. Teachers, doctors and humanitarians killed. Famine is imminent,” she said on X.
“The level and speed of destruction are shocking. Children need a ceasefire now.”
Here are some of the latest images coming out from the newswires:
Israel’s military has explained its decision to withdraw troops from southern Gaza (see earlier post at 11.17 for more details).
The military said a “significant force” will continue to operate in the rest of the besieged Gaza Strip.
“The 98th commando division has concluded its mission in Khan Yunis,” the army said in a statement to AFP. “The division left the Gaza Strip in order to recuperate and prepare for future operations.
“A significant force led by the 162nd division and the Nahal brigade continues to operate in the Gaza Strip and will preserve the IDF’s freedom of action and its ability to conduct precise intelligence based operations,” the statement said.
World Central Kitchen founder, José Andrés, has raised questions over the Israeli probe into an Israeli strike that killed seven of his staff in Gaza, and warned that Israel’s war in Gaza had become a “war against humanity itself”.
“I want to thank, obviously, the IDF, for doing such a quick investigation,” the head of the US-based charity told ABC’s This Week programme.
“At the same time, I would say with something so complicated, the investigation should be much more deeper,” Andrés added.
“And I would say that the perpetrator cannot be investigating himself.”

On Friday, Israel said an inquiry had found that a series of “grave errors” by officers were to blame for the attack, that killed three Britons, three other foreign nationals and a Palestinian colleague while delivering food, and that two middle-ranking officers had been dismissed and a general reprimanded.
In its investigation, the Israeli military claimed that an armed man climbed on the roof of one of the trucks and “started firing his weapon”, leading to suspicions that the “convoy had been hijacked by Hamas”.
When asked about the Israeli report, Andrés questioned the narrative, adding “this is not any more about the seven men and women of World Central Kitchen that perished in this unfortunate event.”
He said that Israel was targeting anything that “seems” to move, and has been doing so “for too long”.
“This doesn’t seem like a war against terror. This doesn’t seem any more like a war about defending Israel,” he said. “This really, at this point, seems like a war against humanity itself.”
An Israeli delegation will take part in the latest round of negotiations in Cairo aimed at reaching a truce in the Gaza conflict and a hostage release deal, an Israeli government official said on Sunday.

Israel reportedly said, in a previous round of talks, that ceasefire discussions would falter unless Hamas presented a list of the hostages, including who is alive and who is dead.
In the same cabinet meeting prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Israel was “one step away from victory” in the war in Gaza.
“We are one step away from victory,” Netanyahu said. “But the price we paid is painful and heartbreaking.”
Speaking as truce talks were expected to resume in Cairo with international mediators, he reiterated “there will be no ceasefire without the return of hostages. It just won’t happen.”
He stressed that “Israel is ready for a deal, Israel is not ready to surrender”.
“Instead of international pressure being directed at Israel, which only causes Hamas to harden its positions, the pressure of the international community should be directed against Hamas. This will advance the release of the hostages.”
Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire after six months of war against Hamas in Gaza until the hostages being held in Gaza are released.
His comments, made at the start of a weekly cabinet meeting, came as a new round of truce talks in Egypt are set to begin.
Netanyahu said that, despite growing international pressure, Israel would not give in to “extreme” demands from Hamas, the militant group which runs Gaza, which sparked the war on 7 October with its deadly attack on southern Israel.
As we reported earlier, the Israeli military has withdrawn more ground troops from the southern Gaza Strip, leaving just one brigade there six months after the start of its war in Gaza.
Palestinian residents of the southern city of Khan Younis, which has come under Israeli bombardment in recent months, said they had seen Israeli forces leaving the centre of the city and retreating to the eastern districts.
Six months on from the start of the war, negotiators plan to meet in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, later to try to reach a ceasefire deal, which has so far remained elusive despite several high-level attempts. According to some media reports, CIA director Bill Burns and Qatari prime minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani will join negotiators from Egypt, Israel and Hamas.
A senior Iranian official said on Sunday that none of Israel’s embassies were safe any more, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

The Israeli military has withdrawn all ground troops from the southern Gaza Strip except for one brigade, a military spokesperson said. The military did not immediately provide further details, and it was unclear whether the withdrawal would delay a long-threatened incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
Prof Nick Maynard was operating on a patient with abdomen and chest bomb injuries when an Israeli missile struck the al-Aqsa hospital’s intensive care unit in the adjacent building, forcing his medical emergency team to withdraw from Gaza days earlier than scheduled.
“I’ve witnessed with my own eyes an attack by the Israel Defense Forces on the intensive care unit there,” said Maynard, who works as a surgeon in Oxford and has been travelling to Gaza since 2010.
The Guardian spoke to volunteer healthcare workers from the UK who have travelled to Gaza with aid organisations since 7 October who claimed the Israeli military was deliberately targeting healthcare infrastructure. They also expressed concerns about continuing their humanitarian work in Gaza after seven international aid workers, including three Britons, were killed by an Israeli airstrike.

Unrwa, the UN Palestinian refugee agency, which is the main UN agency in Gaza, said that six months of Israel’s war in Gaza meant “6 months of never-ending displacement” for the Palestinians in the enclave.
It said on X that “around 1.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes”, with it providing shelter for thousands of families with nowhere else to go.

Famine is “projected and imminent” in the northern half of Gaza, a UN-backed report said last month, and according to Oxfam, since December, the number of people in the Palestinian territory facing “catastrophic levels” of hunger has nearly doubled.
The vast majority of the population has been displaced by Israel’s war and much of the healthcare infrastructure in the besieged enclave destroyed.
A senior Iranian official has warned that none of Israel’s embassies were safe any more, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.
Yahya Rahim Safavi, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, was quoted as saying that Tehran viewed confrontation with Israel as a “legitimate and legal right”.
Iran’s semi-official ISNA new agency published a graphic on Sunday that it said showcased nine different types of Iranian missiles it says are capable of hitting Israel.
It comes after Iran vowed revenge after an airstrike destroyed the Iranian consulate in Damascus, killing at least 11 people last week, including a senior commander in the al-Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
Israel has not confirmed it was behind the strike on Damascus. Though its leaders have said in more general terms that they are operating against Iran, which backs militant groups Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both of which have been in combat with Israel for the past six months.
Preliminary hearings open on Monday at the UN’s top court in a case that seeks an end of German military and other aid to Israel, based on claims that Berlin is “facilitating” acts of genocide and breaches of international law in Israel’s war in Gaza.
Nicaragua has asked the court to hand down preliminary orders known as provisional measures, including that Germany “immediately suspend its aid to Israel, in particular its military assistance including military equipment in so far as this aid may be used in the violation of the Genocide Convention” and international law.“We are calm and we will set out our legal position in court,” German foreign ministry spokesperson Sebastian Fischer said ahead of the hearings.“We reject Nicaragua’s accusations,” Fischer told reporters in Berlin on Friday.
“Germany has breached neither the genocide convention nor international humanitarian law, and we will set this out in detail before the International Court of Justice.”The international court of justice (ICJ) will probably take weeks to deliver its preliminary decision and Nicaragua’s case will probably drag on for years.
In January, the ICJ imposed provisional measures ordering Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and acts of genocide in Gaza. The orders came in a case filed by South Africa accusing Israel of breaching the Genocide Convention.
Israel strongly denies its military campaign amounts to breaches of the Genocide Convention.

Morning Mail: $10m fines mooted for supermarkets; Israel withdraws from southern Gaza; fears over rooming house boom,2024-04-07,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/apr/08/morning-mail-monday-ntwnfb,"Want to get this in your inbox every weekday?

Good morning. Changes are needed to redress a heavy imbalance in market power between suppliers and supermarkets in Australia’s heavily concentrated supermarket industry. So says a report ordered by the federal government, to be released today, but its author, the former Labor trade minister Craig Emerson, stops short of calling for powers to break up the big supermarkets. He says heavy penalties would be “a far more credible deterrent to anti-competitive behaviour”.
Meanwhile, an explosion of interest from investors in rooming houses has prompted concerns about vulnerable residents, and Israel has withdrawn troops from southern Gaza.
Supermarkets | A new report on supermarket competitiveness proposes a mandatory code for operators instead of the current voluntary one, but stops short of urging a breakup of the duopoly.
Housing | An explosion of interest in rooming houses from investors based on their higher rental yields has prompted concern from advocates about unregistered dwellings and vulnerable residents in this “housing of last resort”.
Child protection | The New South Wales government will review a child protection tool that disproportionately affects Aboriginal children – and that has not been updated in the state for more than a decade – as the proportion of children in care who are Indigenous nears 50%.
Gaza | The Australian government should impose targeted sanctions on Israeli officials who have called for the denial of aid to civilians of Gaza, according to humanitarian organisations, faith groups and health experts.
Tertiary education | While domestic students would benefit from boosted rent subsidies, Paul Karp writes, hiking international student visa fees to achieve that could scare away better students to competitor nations.
Southern Gaza | Israel has pulled all of its ground troops out of southern Gaza for “tactical reasons”, the country’s army said, after nearly four months of intense fighting in the decimated city of Khan Younis. The move came as Hamas and Israeli delegations travel to Egypt for ceasefire talks. But is Netanyahu really likely to change course on Gaza?
Russian floods | More than 4,000 people were evacuated in the Orenburg region of Russia after the Ural River overflowed, with a federal emergency declared and preparations for possible flooding under way in three other regions.
Péter Magyar | A political newcomer who is causing headaches for Hungary’s government says his experience as a regime insider can help him succeed against 14-year prime minister Viktor Orbán where other opposition figures have failed.
US politics | The Ohio secretary of state, a Republican, sent a letter to the Ohio Democratic party warning that Joe Biden could be left off the November presidential election ballot.
Long distance | After more than 16,000km over 352 days and across 16 countries, British man Russ Cook became the first person known to have run the length of Africa. He said he was “a little bit tired”.
Sex, drugs and credit cards: new allegations heard at Bruce Lehrmann’s defamation trial against Ten
Bruce Lehrmann’s defamation case against Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson reopened on Thursday, with the former Channel Seven producer Taylor Auerbach giving new evidence. Guardian Australia media correspondent Amanda Meade tells Gabrielle Jackson what the fresh evidence could mean for one of Australia’s highest-profile defamation cases.
Read more on this story: Spotlight producers warned Auerbach about dropping too much money on Seven’s company card while he courted Lehrmann over several months for an exclusive interview, text messages have revealed.
Shortly after Charles Darwin published his magnum opus, The Origin of Species, in 1859, he started reading a little-known 100-year-old work by a wealthy French aristocrat. Its contents were quite a surprise. “Whole pages [of his book] are laughably like mine,” Darwin wrote to a friend. “It is surprising how candid it makes one to see one’s view in another man’s words.”
Darwin later acknowledged Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, as one of the “few” people who had understood that species change and evolve, before Darwin himself.
Buffon also put forward the idea that animals were becoming extinct at a time when most natural historians believed that “God would never allow any species to ever disappear or arise over time”, according to Jason Roberts, writer of a new book about the aristocrat. “The concept of species change and extinction was very controversial.”
It’s 50 years since Ernő Rubik unleashed his mesmerising magic cube on the world. But why, despite the growth in digital games, is the Rubik’s Cube as popular as ever?

Monday briefing: The ‘unprecedented’ pressure to suspend arms exports to Israel,2024-04-08,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/08/monday-briefing-the-unprecedented-pressure-to-suspend-arms-exports-to-israel,"In today’s newsletter: The killing of aid workers in Gaza last week has western leaders under even greater scrutiny – and raises questions about the fragility of the Israeli coalition government
 Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition
Good morning.
Six months since the 7 October massacre by Hamas and the Israeli military’s ensuing ground offensive in Gaza, Israel is more isolated than ever before, and at odds with its closest allies.
One hundred and thirty four hostages are still in captivity, of which about 30 are believed dead, and much of Gaza has been turned into a wasteland. Satellite images suggest more than half of all buildings have been destroyed by the military offensive; the soil and groundwater have been contaminated by munitions and toxins; and, as hunger grips the coastal territory, Israel has been accused of using starvation as a weapon of war and provoking famine in the besieged strip. According to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run territory the death toll stands at more than 33,000, mostly women and children, and more than 75,000 people have been wounded, with little to no access to medical care as most hospitals are no longer fully operational.
But it was the killing of seven aid workers, six of whom were citizens of allied countries, that brought about a tipping point. The diplomatic pressure is now being piled on to Israel, with calls to suspend arms exports growing louder in the UK and US. Over the weekend, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said he had “serious concerns about a breach in international humanitarian law” over Israel’s actions in Gaza because “far too many people have died”.
For today’s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, about whether international pressure will change how Israel fights the war. That’s right after the headlines.
Welfare | Tens of thousands of unpaid carers looking after disabled, frail or ill relatives are being forced to repay huge sums to the government and threatened with criminal prosecution after the Department of Work and Pensions erroneously overpaid them.
NHS | A study of more than 12,200 NHS workers across the UK has found that one in 10 reported unwanted incidents including being touched or kissed, demands for sex in return for favours, or derogatory comments.
Health | Guardian analysis of NHS figures for 2022-23 found that black women are up to six times more likely to experience some of the most serious birth complications during hospital delivery across England than their white counterparts, with the figures being described as “stark” and disheartening”.
Housing | The Resolution Foundation said average rents could increase by 13% over the next three years as current high growth in the private rental market works its way through existing tenancies.
Africa | After more than 9,940 miles (16,000km) over 352 days across 16 countries, Briton Russ Cook, aka the “Hardest Geezer”, has completed the mammoth challenge of running the length of Africa.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have released interim findings of their investigation (which critics have stressed is not independent) into the killing of World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers by Israeli drone strikes. The inquiry found the first strike on the aid convoy was a case of mistaken identity and the other two strikes were “grave errors”. They have also dismissed two officers over their role in the strikes, but the rare contrition is unlikely to provide any comfort.
WCK’s founder, José Andrés, initially said his workers were killed “systematically” and “targeted deliberately, nonstop, until everybody was dead in this convoy”. In response to the military’s findings, he said that the “IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza”, adding that “it’s not enough to simply try to avoid further humanitarian deaths, which have now approached close to 200 [aid workers]. All civilians need to be protected, and all innocent people in Gaza need to be fed and safe. And all hostages must be released.” He later added that Israel is engaging “war against humanity itself”.
“What we’re seeing is a level of pressure that is unprecedented,” Patrick says. “However, one may note the fact that this inflection point has been caused by western aid workers being killed as opposed to the many, many Palestinians who have been killed, both aid workers and civilians.”
The UK government split
There are a growing number of Conservative MPs and peers who are calling for an end to UK arms sales to Israel, though they are not the majority. Alan Duncan, a former minister, is under investigation by the Tories for admonishing what he called pro-Israel “extremists” in his party. On the other side, there is a group of MPs, primarily on the hard right of the party, who are adamant in their support not just for Israel, but for this particular far-right government.
There’s a dilemma for David Cameron, who is also now under pressure to publish the legal advice by the Foreign Office into whether Israel is in breach of international humanitarian law. “If the advice was either leaked or published and it was clear [that Israel breached international law] I think Cameron would be in a difficult position,” Patrick says. “It’s true that he can ignore legal advice, but I think he would have a lot of explaining to do if he does, and there would be a legally arguable case that he was under compulsion from the arms export control regime to act if the advice was clear that international humanitarian law was being breached.”
Both Cameron and Rishi Sunak do not seem to want to make any decision yet. Cameron did warn in a column for the Sunday Times (£) that support for Israel is not “unconditional”, indicating a further hardening of the UK’s position as the war continues. “We expect such a proud and successful democracy to abide by international humanitarian law, even when challenged,” he added.
But Downing Street has given no indication that it plans to halt sales and in reality is likely trying to avoid making any firm moves before the US.
It’s happened before
The banning of arms sales has been presented as a “totemic issue” that would amount to a “total breach of relations between the UK and Israel”, Patrick says. “I don’t really take that view. If the UK had acted more swiftly and clearly, then it wouldn’t have become so difficult to do this.” He also points out that the UK has banned arms sales to Israel before: in 2009 and in 1982.
Growing global response
The Netherlands, Spain, Canada, Belgium and Italy have all suspended arms sales to Israel. Germany and the US, by far the biggest exporters of arms to Israel, have not indicated that they will follow suit. “The amount of arms supplies that the UK gives to Israel is pretty minuscule in comparison with what the US provides,” Patrick says. The US made up 69% of Israel’s arms imports between 2019 and 2023, $3.8bn annually, in comparison with the UK’s £42m ($53m) in 2022 (though the UK may be underreporting its arms sales). “It would still affect the United States if the British government comes to the view that humanitarian law is being breached, as Biden would be under yet more pressure to explain why he is not willing to do the same.”
Though the US has not committed to putting conditions on its arms exports to Israel the mood has grown sour. Biden has been trying to use America’s soft power to encourage Israel to change tack, to no avail. The statement from the US late last week stated the clear need for Israel to change its approach on how it negotiates with Hamas on the issue of a ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages and the release of Palestinian political prisoners.
***Is Israel listening?
Up until this point, Benjamin Netanyahu has not heeded any of the warnings issued by his allies. “But it was striking that within hours of Biden’s call the Israeli security cabinet met and did things that Israel has adamantly refused to do since October,” Patrick says.
For the first time, Netanyahu overrode the objections of the extreme right within his own cabinet and reopened a key crossing into Gaza. Far-right Israeli minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, for instance, was not present at the security cabinet meetings where it was decided to open the Erez crossing for humanitarian aid. Whether it was a calculated political manoeuvre or pure chance that he wasn’t there, Netanyahu is starting to take risks with the extreme elements in his coalition. “That’s really been one of the things that he has not been willing to do so far,” says Patrick, “and that puts the fragility of the Israeli coalition government on the agenda”.
Pressure is building on Netanyahu domestically too. For the second weekend in a row he has faced huge anti-government protests in Israel. Organisers have said 100,000 people converged at demonstrations to call for the embattled prime minister’s resignation. “They haven’t learned anything, they haven’t changed,” Israel’s opposition leader Yair Lapid said. “Until we send them home, they won’t give this country a chance to move forward.”
However, as Jerusalem correspondent Bethan McKernan notes, Netanyahu doesn’t appear to be going anywhere for now. His coalition remains stable, public support for the war in Gaza is strong, and even if elections are held sooner than 2026, it is not impossible that Netanyahu could once again cobble together a coalition.

Museum loses anti-discrimination case – as it happened,2024-04-09,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/apr/09/aukus-asbestos-cost-of-living-housing-renting-weather-floods,"This blog is now closed.
A flurry of late-breaking news to end your Tuesday, folks. We’re going to wrap up the blog now and we’ll be back, as always, tomorrow.
Here’s what happened today:
A decision will be handed down in the defamation case against Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson brought by Bruce Lehrmann on Monday.
In a submission to the federal court in that defamation case, Brittany Higgins has questioned whether she was drugged on night of alleged rape. Higgins has told the federal court the suggestion by an AFP officer that she might have been drugged should have been raised in the defamation trial.
The Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) in Hobart has been ordered “to cease refusing entry to the exhibit known as Ladies Lounge … by persons who do not identify as ladies” after a legal battle. The decision was handed down after Jason Lau, brought an action against the museum, claiming he was denied entry into Ladies Lounge because of his gender.
The Northern Territory government has extended the Alice Springs youth curfew until the territory’s school holidays end next Tuesday. The move was praised by NT Labor MP Marion Scrymgour, who said “the status quo cannot continue”.
A landmark case has kicked off today, with Roxanne Tickle, a transgender woman, suing the women-only social media platform Giggle for Girls for discrimination after being blocked from using the app. It is the first time a case alleging gender discrimination has been heard by the federal court and may have global implications.
The environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, has announced she will reject Walker Corporation’s Toondah harbour project – an apartment and retail development on an internationally important wetland – at Queensland’s Moreton Bay, due to the potential environmental impact.
Australia and its Aukus partners, the US and the UK, confirmed they are considering working with Japan on Aukus pillar 2, which refers to advanced capability development. Anthony Albanese said Japan was a “natural candidate for that to occur”.
Vice Admiral David Johnston has been recommended to serve as new chief of the defence force from July, when General Angus Campbell steps down.
Brittany Higgins questions whether she was drugged on night of alleged rape in new court submission
Brittany Higgins has told the federal court the suggestion by an AFP officer that she might have been drugged on the night she was allegedly raped should have been raised in the defamation trial.
Higgins filed a seven-page submission to the court on Tuesday after being invited by Justice Michael Lee last week to make final submissions concerning her credit before the judgment in Bruce Lehrmann’s defamation case against Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson is handed down on Monday.
Higgins said any question about her evidence should take into account the possibility she may have been drugged on top of her trauma, the submission said.
The suggestion she was drugged was raised by the AFP in a document tendered by former Seven producer Taylor Auerbach last week. Auerbach said he got the document from Lehrmann.
An AFP note in the document - which was a master chronology prepared by Lehrmann’s lawyers - said: “I also have concerns from info I heard that this may have happened before or could happen again. (I was referring to info that alleged victim may have been drugged). Paul [Sherring] – we need to speak to a range of people. Security staff cleaners may have info.”

The Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) in Hobart has been ordered “to cease refusing entry to the exhibit known as Ladies Lounge … by persons who do not identify as ladies” after a legal battle.
The decision was handed down in the Tasmanian civil and administrative tribunal after Jason Lau, who visited Mona last April, brought an action against the museum, claiming he was denied entry into Ladies Lounge because of his gender in a contravention of Tasmania’s Anti-Discrimination Act.
Kirsha Kaechele’s installation Ladies Lounge opened at Mona in 2020. Women who enter the space are pampered by male butlers and served champagne while being surrounded by some of the museum’s finest pieces of art. Those who do not identify as women are not permitted entry.
Lau had argued that denying men access to some of the museum’s most important works (there is a Sidney Nolan, a Pablo Picasso and a trove of antiquities from Mesopotamia, Central America and Africa in the women-only space) is discriminatory. Kaechele said that was the point.

Egyptian refugee Sayed Abdellatif freed after 12 years in Australian detention
A bit of joy for your afternoon. Egyptian refugee Sayed Abdellatif, whose case Guardian Australia has been following and reporting on for more than a decade, has been freed after almost 12 years in Australia’s immigration detention facilities.
He was granted a temporary protection visa and released on Tuesday afternoon from Villawood detention centre.
Abdellatif was emotional as he was reunited with his wife and children, whose faces he had seen only during supervised approved visits to the high security facility during the past decade.
“My family and I are so happy and grateful. Our family is finally back together after so many years of being separated unnecessarily,” he said. “We’ve waited for this for a very very long time.”
The full story is here:
The Labor MP Marion Scrymgour has applauded the decision by Northern Territory chief minister Eva Lawler to extend the Alice Springs youth curfew until the NT school holidays end next Tuesday.
Scrymgour told the ABC the curfew has been a “circuit breaker” that has given the community “respite and breathing room”.
I think that people have wanted the government to lead and take some responsibility for this. All credit to Eva Lawler, she has been very strong about these decisions and I know that they have not been popular decisions.
She has done this in the interest of the community, of the town, for businesses but also, more importantly, for the young ones that are on the street.
Scrymgour says action needs to be taken to reduce the number of liquor licenses in the community, as well as introducing more temporary housing for young people, where they can be connected to services.
The Labor MP said that the curfew and the incidents that prompted it have made people realise that “the status quo cannot continue”.
“People want to do something about this and I think it has taken last week’s riots, the tragic death of the young person, to finally resonate with people that we cannot continue,” she said.
The high-profile fund manager behind failed plans to redevelop Queensland’s Dunk Island has been arrested and charged with four counts of engaging in dishonest conduct, the corporate regulator says.James Mawhinney faced the Melbourne magistrates court on Tuesday and was granted conditional bail including that he remain in Australia. He did not enter a plea. It is understood the businessman behind the collapsed private investment fund Mayfair 101 had recently returned to Melbourne for a retrial of civil proceedings brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) in the federal court.The federal court initially hit Mawhinney with a $30m fine and a 20-year ban on offering financial products for misleading and deceptive conduct.The court has heard that investors – including retirees who were sold the products as alternatives to term deposits, a former Nationals MP and Pauline Hanson’s One Nation political party – stood to lose a combined $211m raised by companies run by Mawhinney since 2016.Mawhinney successfully appealed his sanctions in 2022 on the grounds he was not granted procedural fairness, and a retrial was ordered. Those proceedings began on Monday.The Australian reported the fresh charges relate to an unregistered investment scheme, IPO Wealth.According to ASIC:
It is alleged that on four occasions between 9 August 2019 and 21 April 2020, Mr Mawhinney dishonestly misrepresented to the trustee of the IPO Wealth Fund, that the IPO Wealth Group owned two Italian companies, Poveglia S.R.L. and Retta S.R.L, when it did not.
Mawhinney is due to return to court on 28 June.
In case you need a refresher on the Lehrmann defamation case ahead of the judgment being handed down next week, Amanda Meade, our media correspondent, spoke with deputy editor Gabrielle Jackson for an episode of Full Story. It’s well worth a listen.
Justice Lee will deliver his judgment in the defamation case against Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson brought by Bruce Lehrmann at 10.15am next Monday 15 April.
The judgment was initially due to be handed down last week, but was reopened after Channel Ten argued that fresh evidence should be considered, after bombshell allegations from a former Channel Seven producer about the network’s dealings with Lehrmann in order to secure an exclusive interview with him in 2023.
Ten was successful and former Spotlight producer Taylor Auerbach spent two days in the witness box last week giving dramatic evidence, in which he alleged that Seven paid thousands of dollars for massages, drugs, sex workers, accommodation and meals for Lehrmann while they tried to get him over the line for an exclusive interview. Channel Seven has denied the allegations.
Tickle v Giggle: transgender woman sues female-only app for alleged discrimination in landmark case
We have an update from the landmark Tickle v Giggle case, which is being heard this week at the federal court, from Daisy Dumas, who was in court for the proceedings. She writes:
Roxanne Tickle, a transgender woman from regional New South Wales, is suing the women-only social media platform Giggle for Girls after being blocked from using the app.
In a lawsuit filed in December 2022, Tickle claimed she was unlawfully barred from using Giggle in September 2021 after the firm and its CEO, Sall Grover, said she was a man. Tickle is seeking damages.
The former Liberal party candidate Katherine Deves, representing Giggle, failed to have the case thrown out of court.
The case is the first time alleged gender identity discrimination has been heard by the federal court and goes to the heart of how gender identity is interpreted.
In her opening remarks, Tickle’s barrister Georgina Costello KC said that “Ms Tickle is a woman” but that “the respondents flatly deny that fact.”
Giggle and Grover’s barrister, Bridie Nolan, said the focus must be on biological sex.

"Food aid to Gaza ‘three times more likely’ to be blocked by Israel than other aid, says UN – as it happened",2024-04-09,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/apr/09/middle-east-crisis-live-hamas-israel-ceasefire-talks-gaza-rafah-latest,"This live blog is now closed, you can read more on this story here
Israel has been blocking far more convoys carrying food aid within Gaza, where famine is looming, than convoys carrying other kinds of aid, the UN has said.
A spokesperson for the UN’s humanitarian agency pointed to statistics from March showing that it was much more difficult to get clearance for delivering food than other aid in the besieged enclave.
“Food convoys that should be going particularly to the north, where 70 percent of people face famine conditions, are … three times more likely to be denied than any other humanitarian convoys with other kinds of material,” Jens Laerke told reporters in Geneva.
Laerke also pointed to delays linked to the crossing point opening hours and the fact that Israel has barred Egyptian drivers and trucks from being in the same area at the same time as Palestinian drivers and trucks.
“That means there’s not a smooth handover,” Laerke said.
The main problem though was then getting authorisation and assurances that aid distribution can go ahead unimpeded, he said.
Israel is facing mounting international pressure to allow more aid into Gaza, which is facing a deepening humanitarian catastrophe. Israel says the main problem is with UN aid distribution within Gaza.
741 humanitarian aid trucks were inspected and transferred to the Gaza Strip over the last 2 days. Only 267 aid trucks were distributed by @UN aid agencies inside Gaza (out of which 146 carried food). The aid is available, distribution is what matters. https://t.co/def8xdYUF1
Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that manages the flow of aid, wrote on X earlier today that “741 humanitarian aid trucks were inspected and transferred to the Gaza Strip over the last 2 days”.
“Only 267 aid trucks were distributed by UN aid agencies inside Gaza (out of which 146 carried food),” it said.
“The aid is available, distribution is what matters.”
Hamas has said Israel’s proposal that it received from Qatari and Egyptian mediators did not meet any of the demands of Palestinian factions. But the Palestinian militant group also said on Tuesday it was considering a new framework for a truce proposed during the latest round of negotiations in Cairo. The three-part proposal would halt fighting for six weeks to facilitate an exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israel.
Defying international condemnation over the proposal, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said a date had been set for an invasion of Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah, without specifying when. Many western countries, including the US, have voiced strong opposition to the proposed Israeli ground invasion as any attack on Rafah is likely to cause many more civilian casualties and worsen an already acute humanitarian crisis across Gaza. Israel says it has a plan to evacuate civilians ahead of its offensive, and Israel’s defence ministry on Monday published a tender seeking a supplier of tents. The Israeli official later confirmed that the tents were part of the Rafah preparations.
At least 33,360 Palestinians have been killed and 75,993 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement.
Israel has, for the first time, used a seaborne missile defence system to shoot down a drone approaching from the Red Sea that had set off sirens in the port city of Eilat, the military said. “Overnight, for the first time ever, an IDF Sa’ar 6-class corvette missile ship successfully intercepted a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) that had approached from the east and had crossed into the area of the Gulf of Eilat,” the military said on Tuesday.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees must remain “the backbone of any humanitarian response” for the 2 million people in Gaza if mass starvation is to be avoided, the Unrwa director of planning, Sam Rose, has said. This warning came as Israel was accused of blocking far more convoys carrying food aid within Gaza, where famine is looming, than convoys carrying other kinds of aid. “Food convoys that should be going particularly to the north, where 70 percent of people face famine conditions, are … three times more likely to be denied than any other humanitarian convoys with other kinds of material,” Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN’s humanitarian agency, told reporters in Geneva.
Turkey will impose restrictions on the export of products from 54 different categories to Israel until a ceasefire is declared in Gaza, the Turkish trade ministry said. The ministry said the measures would take effect immediately, adding that the restrictions would include iron and steel products and construction equipment, among other things. In response, Israel vowed to take steps against Turkey, accusing it of violating trade deals between the two countries.
France’s foreign minister, Stéphane Séjourné, has suggested that the international community should pressure Israel by potentially imposing sanctions to force it to allow more aid into Gaza. “There must be levers of influence and there are multiple levers, going up to sanctions to let humanitarian aid cross checkpoints,” he told French outlets RFI radio and France 24.
Israeli warplanes struck a Syrian military position overnight in response to rocket fire on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, the military said on Tuesday. The Israeli military said on Tuesday that “warplanes attacked Syrian army military infrastructure overnight in the Mahajjah area” – about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the demilitarised zone separating the opposing forces. The Israeli army said it identified a rocket launch from Syrian territory on Monday that caused no casualties. It said artillery struck the source of the fire.
We are closing this blog now, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Middle East coverage here.
The commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards navy said on Tuesday that Israel’s presence in the United Arab Emirates was a threat to Tehran and this “should not happen”.
Reuters reports:
Iran has threatened to retaliate for suspected Israeli airstrikes on its consulate in Syria’s capital last week that killed seven Revolutionary Guards officers including two senior commanders, stoking tensions between the Middle East arch enemies already simmering over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.
The UAE, situated across the Gulf from Iran, became the most prominent Arab nation to forge diplomatic ties with Israel in 30 years under a U.S.-brokered accord in 2020, though Abu Dhabi also has normal diplomatic and commercial relations with Tehran.
“We know that the Zionists (Israel) were not brought to the UAE for economic purposes but rather for security and military work. This is a threat to us and should not happen,” Revolutionary Guards Navy Cmdr Alireza Tangsiri said, according to Iran’s semi-official Student news agency.
Tangsiri added that the Gulf, as well as the Gulf of Oman outside the strait of Hormuz through which a major amount of the world’s seaborne oil passes, were no places for Israelis.
He did not indicate whether Iran was considering any action in the region over Israel’s presence.
“We do not get hit without striking back, but we are also not hasty in our retaliation,” Tangsiri said, a few days after a senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader warned that Israeli embassies were no longer safe.
The UAE’s normalisation with Israel paved the way for several other Arab states to follow suit, breaking a taboo on diplomatic ties without the creation of a Palestinian state.
Israel has been blocking far more convoys carrying food aid within Gaza, where famine is looming, than convoys carrying other kinds of aid, the UN has said.
A spokesperson for the UN’s humanitarian agency pointed to statistics from March showing that it was much more difficult to get clearance for delivering food than other aid in the besieged enclave.

Israel is facing mounting international pressure to allow more aid into Gaza, which is facing a deepening humanitarian catastrophe. Israel says the main problem is with UN aid distribution within Gaza.

“Only 267 aid trucks were distributed by UN aid agencies inside Gaza (out of which 146 carried food),” it said.
“The aid is available, distribution is what matters.”
Israel says aid is moving into Gaza more quickly after international pressure to increase access, Reuters reports, but the amount is disputed. And the United Nations (UN) says it is still much less than the bare minimum to meet humanitarian needs.
Israel said 419 trucks – the most since the conflict began – entered on Monday; though the Red Crescent and United Nations gave much lower figures – with the UN saying many were only half-full because of Israeli inspection rules.
Aid agencies have complained Israel is not ensuring enough access for food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies. And the European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has accused the nation of using starvation as a weapon of war.
The UN humanitarian agency (OCHA) spokesperson Jens Laerke has also pointed to severe restrictions on delivery of aid inside Gaza itself last month; saying Israel had denied permission for half the convoys it tried sending to the north in March – with UN aid convoys three times more likely to be refused than any other.
The Israeli military department responsible for aid transfers denies it is hindering humanitarian relief into Gaza, saying there is no limit on supplies for civilians and blaming delays on the United Nations, which it says is inefficient.
Israel will complete the elimination of Hamas’ brigades, including in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, and nothing will prevent this, Reuters quotes the country’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying.
There is no force in the world that will stop us. There are many forces that are trying to do so, but it will not help, since this enemy, after what it did, will never do it again.
Netanyahu has defied international condemnation to say he has set a date for an invasion of Gaza’s southernmost city – though he did not specify what it would be.
Many western countries, including the US, have voiced strong opposition to the proposed Israeli ground invasion as any attack on Rafah is likely to cause many more civilian casualties and worsen an already acute humanitarian crisis across Gaza.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees must remain “the backbone of any humanitarian response” for the 2 million people in Gaza if mass starvation is to be avoided, the Unrwa director of planning, Sam Rose, has said.
Israel is continuing to impede Unrwa convoys to northern Gaza, where 300,000 people are facing famine, he said. “Our space is continuing to be squeezed at a time when the international community urgently needs to get as much assistance as possible to people in the north.”
More than half of the 16 countries that suspended funding of Unrwa – the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East – after Israel claimed 12 of the 13,000 Unrwa staff in Gaza had taken part in the attack on Israel on 7 October have already decided to resume funding.

Israel has, for the first time, used a seaborne missile defence system to shoot down a drone approaching from the Red Sea that had set off sirens in the port city of Eilat, the military said on Tuesday.
Eilat has been a frequent target for launches by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen as a show of support for Hamas.
Israel positioned missile boats in the Red Sea after the start of its war in Gaza, the military said. One of those missile boats has shot down the drone with the new system called the C-Dome, Reuters reported.
“Overnight, for the first time ever, an IDF Sa’ar 6-class corvette missile ship successfully intercepted a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) that had approached from the east and had crossed into the area of the Gulf of Eilat,” the military said.
Nicaragua has asked the international court of justice (ICJ) to order Germany to halt military arms exports to Israel and to resume its funding of the UN Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa, saying there is a serious risk of genocide in Gaza.
At least 33,360 Palestinians have been killed and 75,993 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
Most of the casualties have been women and children, the health ministry has said, and thousands more bodies are likely to remain uncounted under rubble across Gaza.
The foreign minister, Penny Wong, says the recognition of a Palestinian state is “the only hope to break the endless cycle of violence” in the Middle East and a two-state solution would help ensure long-term security for Israel and further undermine Hamas.
In a speech on Tuesday, Wong also again called on the Netanyahu government to abandon plans for a Gaza ground invasion in Rafah, urging Israel to make “major and immediate changes” to its military campaign to protect civilians and warning of imminent starvation among besieged Palestinians.
“Because the simple truth is that a secure and prosperous future for both Israelis and Palestinians will only come with a two-state solution – recognition of each other’s right to exist,” Wong told an ANU National Security College conference.

An Israeli airstrike on a municipality building of al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip killed the head of the municipality council, Hatem Al-Ghamri, and four other civilians, the Hamas-run government media office and medics said.
The Israeli military said it killed Ghamri, who it described as a military operative in Hamas’ Maghazi Battalion involved in rocket launches against Israel.
Hamas said Ghamri was a civil service official and described his killing as an “assassination”.
An Israeli airstrike on a house in Deir Al-Balah killed one Palestinian and injured 20 other people, Hamas said.
In Rafah, the southern city on the Egyptian border, a missile fired from a drone reportedly killed one man and injured several others. These claims have not yet been independently verified.
Unrwa, the UN Palestinian refugee agency, which is the main UN agency in Gaza, has said it urgently needs more access to the besieged enclave.
The agency says it has delivered more than 10m food units and 24m litres of water to Palestinians in the enclave since the war began in October, but this has not been enough to meet the needs of the population.

UN sources have said Israel wants to dismantle Unrwa, which provides humanitarian assistance and basic services in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, and is a critical part of social infrastructure in Gaza.
Israel has accused Unrwa staff members of participating in the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, and called the agency “a front for Hamas”.
Unrwa has said the contracts of those staff members have been immediately terminated with an investigation launched.
Unrwa has reportedly not been able to deliver food to the north since 29 January, where famine looms.
Hamas has said Israel’s proposal that it received from Qatari and Egyptian mediators did not meet any of the demands of Palestinian factions. But the Palestinian militant group also said on Tuesday it was considering a new framework for a truce proposed during the latest round of negotiations in Cairo.

The Israeli army said it identified a rocket launch from Syrian territory on Monday that caused no casualties. It said artillery struck the source of the fire.
Israel vowed on Tuesday to take steps against Turkey, accusing it of violating trade deals between the two countries after Ankara announced trade restrictions over the war in Gaza (see earlier post at 07.44 for more details).
“Turkey is unilaterally violating the trade agreements with Israel, and Israel will adopt the necessary steps against it,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, sharply criticised Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for the decision.
“Erdoğan is once again sacrificing the economic interests of the people of Turkey for his support of the Hamas murderers in Gaza who raped, murdered and desecrated the bodies of women, girls, adults and burned children alive,” he wrote in a post on X.
“Israel will not submit to violence and extortion and will not condone the unilateral violation of the trade agreements and will take parallel measures against Turkey that will harm the Turkish economy.”
ארדואן @RTErdogan שוב מקריב את האינטרסים הכלכליים של תושבי טורקיה למען תמיכתו במרצחי החמאס בעזה שאנסו, רצחו וחיללו גופות של נשים, נערות, מבוגרים ושרפו ילדים בחיים. ישראל לא תיכנע לאלימות ולסחטנות ולא תבליג על ההפרה החד צדדית של הסכמי הסחר ותנקוט נגד טורקיה בצעדים מקבילים שיפגעו…
Israel is now preparing an “expanded list of products” it intends to stop importing from Turkey, the ministry said, including construction materials like steel and cement.
Israel’s security is at the “core” of German foreign policy, the UN’s highest court heard on Tuesday, where Berlin is defending itself against a claim that it is furnishing Israel with weapons being used on Gaza.
“Our history is the reason why Israel’s security has been at the core of Germany foreign policy,” Germany’s representative told the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague.
“Where Germany has provided support to Israel, including in a form of export of arms and other military equipment, the quality and purposes of these supplies have been grossly distorted by Nicaragua,” Tania von Uslar-Gleichen said.
Nicaragua has brought Germany before the ICJ to demand that judges impose emergency measures to stop Berlin from providing Israel with weapons and other assistance.
Lawyers for Nicaragua argued that Germany is in breach of the 1948 UN Genocide Convention, set up in the wake of the Holocaust, by furnishing Israel with weapons.
In January, the ICJ imposed provisional measures ordering Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and acts of genocide in Gaza. The orders came in a case filed by South Africa accusing Israel of breaching the Genocide Convention.
Israel strongly denies its military campaign amounts to breaches of the Genocide Convention.
France’s foreign minister, Stéphane Séjourné, has suggested that the international community should pressure Israel by potentially imposing sanctions to force it to allow more aid into Gaza.
“There must be levers of influence and there are multiple levers, going up to sanctions to let humanitarian aid cross checkpoints,” he was quoted by Al Jazeera as having told French outlets RFI radio and France 24.
“France was one of the first countries to propose European Union sanctions on Israeli settlers who are committing acts of violence in the West Bank. We will continue if needed to obtain the opening of humanitarian aid,” he added.
The UN’s human rights chief, Volker Turk, said last month that Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid for Gaza may amount to a starvation tactic that could be a war crime.
Famine is “projected and imminent” in the northern half of Gaza, a UN-backed report said last month, and according to Oxfam the number of people facing “catastrophic levels” of hunger has nearly doubled since December.
Israel denies blocking aid, saying shortages are a result of logistics failures by humanitarian organisations or Hamas diverting supplies.
But aid agencies say that delivery has been severely hampered by a combination of logistical obstacles, damaged roads, a breakdown of public order and lengthy bureaucratic controls imposed by Israel.
Some aid groups have said sending truck convoys north has been too dangerous because of the military’s failure to ensure safe passage.

Middle East crisis live: Israel threatens to strike Iran directly – as it happened,2024-04-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/apr/10/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-and-us-say-number-of-aid-trucks-into-gaza-increasing,"Israel’s foreign minister says Israel will attack Iran directly if Tehran launches an attack from its territory
Israel’s foreign minister threatened on Wednesday that its country’s forces would strike Iran directly if the Islamic Republic launched an attack from its territory against Israel, as tensions between the two countries flare after the killings of Iranian generals in a blast at the Iranian consulate in Syria, reports the Associated Press (AP).“If Iran attacks from its territory, Israel will respond and attack in Iran,” Israel Katz said in a post on X in both Farsi and Hebrew.
اگر ایران از خاک خود حمله کند، اسرائیل واکنش نشان داده و در ایران حمله خواهد کرد @khamenei_ir
אם איראן תתקוף משטחה - ישראל תגיב ותתקוף באיראן.@khamenei_ir
The remarks came after Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated early on Wednesday a promise to retaliate against Israel over the attack on its consulate in Damascus earlier this month.Tehran holds Israel responsible for the strike that killed 12 people. Israel has not acknowledged its involvement, though it has been bracing for an Iranian response to the attack, a significant escalation in their long-running shadow war.Khamenei spoke at a prayer ceremony celebrating the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, saying the airstrike was “wrongdoing” and akin to an attack on Iranian territory.
It is 4.15pm in Gaza and 5.15pm in Tel Aviv and Beirut. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Middle East coverage here.
Here is a recap of the latest developments:
Aid shipments to Gaza are expected to resume soon from Cyprus, officials said on Wednesday. The US plans to set up a dock, with a target date of 1 May, on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast that will enable aid deliveries which will be pre-screened in Cyprus, with Israeli oversight. With that jetty in place, Cyprus expects aid to resume soon, Cypriot president Nikos Christodoulides said.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated on Wednesday a promise to retaliate against Israel over the killings of Iranian generals in Syria. Israel has not acknowledged its involvement. Khamenei spoke at a prayer ceremony, saying the airstrike that demolished Iran’s consulate in Syria earlier this month was “wrongdoing” against a diplomatic post that is considered Iranian territory. “The evil regime must be punished, and it will be punished,” he said.
Israel’s foreign minister threatened on Wednesday that its country’s forces would strike Iran directly if the Islamic Republic launched an attack from its territory against Israel. “If Iran attacks from its territory, Israel will respond and attack in Iran,” Israel Katz said in a post on X in both Farsi and Hebrew.
Israel said it was moving aid into Gaza more quickly in the as a result of international pressure, but the figures have been disputed. Israel said 468 aid trucks were moved into Gaza on Tuesday, the highest since the conflict began. That followed 419 on Monday. But the Red Crescent and UN have given much lower figures, with the UN saying many trucks were only half full because of Israeli inspection rules.
US president Joe Biden said Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s approach on Gaza was a “mistake” and urged Israel to call for a ceasefire, in an interview that aired on Tuesday. “I think what he’s doing is a mistake. I don’t agree with his approach,” Biden told Univision, a US Spanish-language TV network, when asked about Netanyahu’s handling of the war.
Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez warned on Wednesday that Israel’s “disproportionate response” in the Gaza war with Hamas risks “destabilising the Middle East, and as a consequence, the entire world”. Sánchez also insisted that the recognition of a Palestinian state, long resisted by Israel and its key allies, is “in Europe’s geopolitical interests”.
Eid al-Fitr was observed by Muslims across the world on Wednesday, including in Gaza, where Eid prayers were held outside the ruins of a mosque in Rafah to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Some displaced worshippers knelt on plastic tarpaulin outside tents where they are living after Israeli offensives destroyed their homes and infrastructure.
The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, confirmed the government will not suspend arms exports to Israel after the killing of seven aid workers in an airstrike on Gaza last week, as he insisted the UK would continue to act within international law. Cameron said that he had reviewed the most recent legal advice about the situation on the ground but this left the UK’s position on export licences “unchanged”.
A vigil for the more than 100 people who remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped by Hamas in October took place in central London on Tuesday. The event, which was organised by groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council, was addressed by family members of the hostages and Jewish religious figures.
The commander of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon (Unifil), Aroldo Lazaro, said on Wednesday the danger of escalation on the Lebanon-Israel border was real. “Unifil calls for a return to the cessation of hostilities, and a move towards a permanent ceasefire and a long-term solution to the conflict,” Lazaro said in a statement.
Israeli forces kept up combat operations and airstrikes on Gaza on Wednesday, reported AFP, a day after Netanyahu vowed no let up in the campaign to destroy Hamas and bring home the hostages. Netanyahu insisted on that “no force in the world” would stop Israeli troops from entering Gaza’s far-southern city of Rafah which is packed with displaced Palestinians.
A residential home was hit overnight by an Israeli airstrike that killed 14 people, mostly women and children, and seriously injured 30 others, Dr Khalil Al-Dikran, the spokesperson of the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital told CNN.
Israel has agreed in ceasefire talks in Egypt to concessions about the return of Palestinians to the north of Gaza, but believes Hamas does not want to strike a deal, Israeli officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Two officials with knowledge of the talks told the news agency that under a US proposal for a truce, Israel would allow the return of 150,000 Palestinians to north Gaza with no security checks. In return, they said, Hamas would be required to give a list of female, elderly and sick hostages it still holds alive. Netanyahu’s office declined to comment.
According to the UN, 95% of pregnant and breastfeeding women in Gaza are not getting adequate food or nutrition. In a release published by the UN’s Population Fund (UNFPA), that was updated on 2 April, the UN agency warned that about 155,000 pregnant women and new mothers were “struggling to survive”. It said they were “suffering from hunger and the diseases … amid life-threatening shortages of food, water and medical care”.
At least 33,482 Palestinians have been killed and 76,049 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas. It also said 122 Palestinians were killed and 56 injured in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.
A Lebanese man under US sanctions for allegedly funnelling money from Iran to Hamas has been killed just outside Beirut, a security source told AFP on Wednesday. The body of Mohammad Sarur was found on Tuesday in a villa in the mountain town of Beit Mery, the source told AFP, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Palestine’s ambassador to Ireland on Wednesday welcomed Dublin’s promise to formally recognise Palestinian statehood and hoped other EU members will follow. “I hope that this recognition by Ireland will be a reality soon, and Ireland will lead other EU states to follow suit,” Dr Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid told RTÉ on Wednesday. “Ireland has always stood on the right side of history, justice, humanity international law – so I expected that Ireland will lead in the recognition of the state of Palestine.” Asked if Ireland should have already done so she said: “Yes.”
Current and former US officials, who have spoken to the BBC, said that the US president’s pressure on Israel after last week’s deadly attack on aid workers did not go far enough. They also said that it would fail to stem the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
The Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, has said a “pathway out of the endless cycle of violence” in the Middle East can only come with recognition of “a Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel”. Some commentators have interpreted the speech as a hint that Australia could recognise Palestinian statehood in the near term, although Wong has clarified that the government has made no such decision.
Three people were charged in the UK after a pro-Palestine demonstration outside Labour leader Keir Starmer’s home, the Metropolitan police said on Wednesday. In its statement, the Met said that “two women and a man arrested in Kentish Town on Tuesday 9 April have been charged with public order offences and will appear at Westminster magistrates court”.
Rishi Sunak defended the UK’s decision not to suspend arms sales to Israel, saying “none of our closest allies” have stopped existing export licences but added Netanyahu “needs to do more” to alleviate suffering in Gaza. Sunak made the comments on Wednesday when responding to a caller on his LBC phone-in interview.
Oxfam responded to a press conference on the conflict in Gaza, held in New York, where the UK foreign secretary mentioned having a ‘plan B’ should the conflict escalate into Rafah. “There is no plan B for more than a million desperate people currently sheltering in Rafah – if Israel launches a ground offensive, then the scale of the crisis would be catastrophic,” said Oxfam’s chief impact officer, Aleema Shivji.
The World Health Organization (WHO) teams arrived at Al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza on Monday to help identify bodies in the ruins. Motasem Salah, director of the Gaza Emergency Operations Centre, told AFP the scenes on Monday at the sprawling medical centre were “unbearable”. Salah said Gaza lacked the forensic experts needed to help identify the dead or determine what had happened to them. So they are relying on “the expertise of the WHO and OCHA (UN humanitarian office) delegation”, he said.
Aid shipments to Gaza are expected to resume soon from Cyprus, officials said on Wednesday, reports Reuters.
According to the news agency, Cyprus has about 1,000 tons of aid destined for starving or severely hungry people in Gaza stored on the island. It is being held there after a decision by World Central Kitchen (WCK) to pause and review activity in the territory after the deaths of its workers on 1 April.
The US plans to set up a dock, with a target date of 1 May, on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast that will enable aid deliveries which will be pre-screened in Cyprus, with Israeli oversight. With that jetty in place, Cyprus expects aid to resume soon, Cypriot president Nikos Christodoulides said.
“We are in communication with countries we have worked with from the outset, so that very soon humanitarian aid from Cyprus will resume after the completion of the US project in Gaza,” he said.
The WCK had been operational in Gaza since October, using land, air and more recently the sea, to get aid in to supply its network of more than 60 community kitchens.
Workers were midway into unloading a second shipment of aid through the Cyprus route when their three-vehicle convoy was hit by Israeli strikes.
After WCK announced the pause, a convoy of ships taking part in the mission returned to Cyprus on 3 April 3 with undelivered aid, said Reuters. Initially at anchorage, the ship carrying food was brought to port for offloading after bad weather in Cyprus this week.
“The plan is to store the aid until WCK decides what it wants to do,” a Cypriot official told Reuters.
According to the UN, 95% of pregnant and breastfeeding women in Gaza are not getting adequate food or nutrition.

In a release published by the UN’s Population Fund (UNFPA), that was updated on 2 April, the UN agency warned that about 155,000 pregnant women and new mothers were “struggling to survive”. It said they were “suffering from hunger and the diseases … amid life-threatening shortages of food, water and medical care”.
At the time of UNFPA’s update, only three maternity hospitals remained in the Gaza Strip, and these were “overwhelmed with patients”, the UN agency said.
“If women do survive pregnancy and childbirth, they must return to overcrowded shelters and informal settlements that lack clean water and hygiene facilities,” added the UN agency for sexual and reproductive health.
Current and former US officials, who have spoken to the BBC, say that US president Joe Biden’s pressure on Israel after last week’s deadly attack on aid workers did not go far enough. They also said that it would fail to stem the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
A the tougher line by Biden, after seven workers from food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) were killed by Israeli strikes, was “too little, too late”, according to Annelle Sheline, an official working in human rights who quit the state department in protest a fortnight ago.
She told the BBC that the White House “could have done this months ago and prevented famine in northern Gaza”.
The BBC report also highlights the views of four current officials at varying levels of seniority in different government departments who spoke to the broadcaster on condition of anonymity. According to the BBC, two of the officials have roles in areas with direct links to foreign policy, including on Israel and Gaza.
Tom Bateman, the BBC’s state department correspondent writes:
The officials’ accounts are the latest sign of deepening disquiet and a growing readiness within the ranks of the Biden administration to question the moral and legal basis of US backing for Israel, a bedrock of Washington policy going back decades across administrations.
Some criticised the support as apparently unconditional, citing Washington’s $3.8bn (£3bn) a year package of military assistance to Israel and the potential sale of $18bn worth of F-15 fighter jets.”
Israel has agreed in ceasefire talks in Egypt to concessions about the return of Palestinians to the north of Gaza, but believes Hamas does not want to strike a deal, Israeli officials said on Wednesday.
Reuters reports that two officials with knowledge of the talks said that under a US proposal for a truce, Israel would allow the return of 150,000 Palestinians to north Gaza with no security checks.
In return, they said, Hamas would be required to give a list of female, elderly and sick hostages it still holds alive.
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office declined to comment, say Reuters. Hamas said on Tuesday that the latest proposal passed on by Eqyptian and Qatari mediators did not meet demands, but that it would study it further before responding.
Israel’s assessment is that Hamas does not want to strike a deal yet, the two Israeli officials told the news agency.
Hamas wants an end to the Israeli military offensive, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and permission for displaced Palestinians to return home.
Israel’s immediate aim is to secure the release of hostages seized by Hamas in its 7 October attack. Israel says it will not end the war until Hamas no longer controls Gaza or threatens Israel militarily.
The latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 122 Palestinians were killed and 56 injured in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours.
According to the statement, at least 33,482 Palestinians have been killed and 76,049 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October.
The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.
In the UK, three people have been charged after a pro-Palestine demonstration outside Labour leader Keir Starmer’s home, the Metropolitan police have said.
On Tuesday demonstrators hung a banner outside Sir Keir’s house that read: “Starmer stop the killing”, surrounded by red hand prints. Protesters then laid rows of children’s shoes in front of the Labour leader’s door to signify children killed in Gaza.
The group that carried out the demonstration, known as Youth Demand, describe itself as a “new youth resistance campaign fighting for an end to genocide”.
A Metropolitan police statement said: “Two women and a man arrested in Kentish Town on Tuesday 9 April have been charged with public order offences and will appear at Westminster magistrates court.”
“This power stops the harassment of a person at their home address if an officer suspects it is causing alarm or distress to the occupant,” the statement added.
The three protesters have been charged with public order offences.
In a video posted to X, Youth Demand called for a two-way arms embargo on Israel, saying that weapons manufactured in the UK were being “used to cause genocide’’.

Starmer, who leads the opposition in parliament, has been criticised by some for his approach to Israel’s actions in Gaza since 7 October, which has led to more than 30,000 deaths and a humanitarian crisis.
Last October, he said that Israel had “the right” to withhold water and power from Palestinians which prompted some Labour councillors to resign. He later denied making these comments, saying: “I was not saying that Isreal had to right to cut off water, food, fuel or medicines.”
The UK government has faced increasing pressure to suspend arms export licences to Israel after seven aid workers, including three British nationals, were killed by an Israeli airstrike.
Starmer has reiterated calls for the government to publish legal advice it has received on whether Israel is violating international law in Gaza, with the party’s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy stating arms sales should be halted if there has been a “serious breach” of international law.
Prime minister Rishi Sunak condemned the protest on social media. He posted to X: “I don’t care what your politics are, no MP should be harassed at their own home. We cannot and will not tolerate this.”
Eid al-Fitr is being observed by Muslims across the world today, including in Gaza.
Eid prayers were held outside the ruins of a mosque in Rafah to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Some displaced worshippers knelt on plastic tarpaulin outside tents where they are living after Israeli offensives destroyed their homes and infrastructure
Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum is reporting from the ground in Gaza. He said: “Over the past few hours, the situation has been extremely calm on the ground. We have not recorded any military attacks on Gaza. This is considered to be one of the few periods in months that the Strip hasn’t been widely hit by the Israeli army.”
Dr. Khalil Al-Dikran, the spokesperson of the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, told CNN that a residential home was struck overnight by an Israeli airstrike that killed 14 people, mostly women and children, adding that 30 others were seriously injured.
Here are some of the latest images on the newswires:
Israeli strikes hit Gaza on Wednesday as Muslims marked the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan and after US president Joe Biden labelled Israel’s approach to the war a “mistake” (see 07:29 BST).
AFP reports that Israeli forces kept up combat operations and airstrikes on Gaza on Wednesday, a day after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed no let up in the campaign to destroy Hamas and bring home the hostages.
Netanyahu insisted on that “no force in the world” would stop Israeli troops from entering Gaza’s far-southern city of Rafah which is packed with displaced Palestinians.
According to AFP, Netanyahu’s threat came amid talks in Cairo involving US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators for a truce and hostage release deal.
Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez warned on Wednesday that Israel’s “disproportionate response” in the Gaza war with Hamas risks “destabilising the Middle East, and as a consequence, the entire world”, reports AFP.
Sánchez also insisted that the recognition of a Palestinian state, long resisted by Israel and its key allies, is “in Europe’s geopolitical interests”.
Sánchez had already raised the subject of statehood during a visit last week to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, when he told reporters that Spain could recognise Palestine as a nation by the end of June.
“The international community cannot help the Palestinian state if it does not recognise its existence,” Sánchez told lawmakers on Wednesday, according to AFP.
Since the start of the war in Gaza more than six months ago, the socialist premier has pushed for Europe to accord such recognition. His criticism of the Gaze war has also raised tensions with Israel.
Speaking on Wednesday, Sánchez said Israel’s “absolutely disproportionate response” had “overturned decades of humanitarian law and threatened to destabilise the Middle East and, as a consequence, the whole world”.
In late March, Sánchez signed a joint statement alongside his Irish, Maltese and Slovenian counterparts on the sidelines of an EU summit announcing they were ready “to recognise Palestine” when “the circumstances are right” if that could help bring about a resolution to the conflict.
Starting Thursday, Sánchez is due to visit Poland, Norway and Ireland before welcoming Portugal’s leader to again discuss the issue, Spanish government spokesperson Pilar Alegría said on Tuesday, according to AFP.
Palestine’s ambassador to Ireland has welcomed Dublin’s promise to formally recognise Palestinian statehood and hopes other EU members will follow.
“I hope that this recognition by Ireland will be a reality soon, and Ireland will lead other EU states to follow suit,” Dr Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid told RTÉ on Wednesday. “Ireland has always stood on the right side of history, justice, humanity international law – so I expected that Ireland will lead in the recognition of the state of Palestine.”
Asked if Ireland should have already done so she said: “Yes.”
On Tuesday the foreign minister, Micheál Martin, earned sustained applause in the Dáil when he promised formal recognition once “wider international discussions” were complete. “Be in no doubt recognition of a Palestinian state will happen,” he said.
On 22 March Ireland and Spain – two of Israel’s sharpest critics in the EU – were joined by Malta and Slovenia in a vow to recognise Palestine when “the circumstances are right”.
The Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, has said a “pathway out of the endless cycle of violence” in the Middle East can only come with recognition of “a Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel”.
Some commentators have interpreted the speech as a hint that Australia could recognise Palestinian statehood in the near term, although Wong has clarified that the government has made no such decision.
So what did Wong actually say about a two-state solution, what was she silent about, and how does this fit in with what Australia’s allies are doing? Guardian Australia’s foreign affairs and defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst, has answered these questions in this explainer:
A Lebanese man under US sanctions for allegedly funnelling money from Iran to Hamas has been killed just outside Beirut, a security source told AFP on Wednesday.
The body of Mohammad Sarur was found on Tuesday in a villa in the mountain town of Beit Mery, the source told AFP, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
He had been struck by more than five bullets and was found in possession of an undisclosed sum of money that the killers did not touch, the source added.
Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported late on Tuesday that the body of a 57-year-old Lebanese man, identified by initials that correspond to Sarur’s, had been found in an area near Beit Mery.
The security source confirmed to AFP that Sarur was subject to US sanctions, and said he worked for financial institutions belonging to Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, a Hamas ally.
In August 2019, the US Treasury announced sanctions against several people including Sarur, accusing them of funnelling “tens of millions of dollars” from the foreign operations arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards through Hezbollah in Lebanon “to Hamas for terrorist attacks originating from the Gaza Strip”.
The Treasury said Sarur “served as a middle-man” between the Guards’ al-Quds force and Hamas “and worked with Hezbollah operatives to ensure funds were provided” to Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades.
“As of 2014, Sarur was identified as in charge of all money transfers” between the al-Quds force and the Qassam Brigades, the US Treasury added.
He also “has an extensive history working at Hezbollah’s sanctioned bank, Bayt al-Mal”, the US Treasury said. Washington blacklisted Bayt al-Mal in 2006.
Last month, US Treasury official Jesse Baker met with political and financial officials in Beirut, asking them to prevent funds from transiting through Lebanon to Hamas, media reports said at the time.
Israel’s foreign minister threatened on Wednesday that its country’s forces would strike Iran directly if the Islamic Republic launched an attack from its territory against Israel, as tensions between the two countries flare after the killings of Iranian generals in a blast at the Iranian consulate in Syria, reports the Associated Press (AP).“If Iran attacks from its territory, Israel will respond and attack in Iran,” Israel Katz said in a post on X in both Farsi and Hebrew.

The World Health Organization (WHO) teams arrived at Al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza on Monday to help identify bodies in the ruins, reports the news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP).
The Israeli military said it battled with Palestinian militants in what was Gaza’s biggest hospital during two weeks of fierce fighting last month, with the WHO saying that patients were trapped inside.
Palestinian nurse Maha Sweylem told AFP that she had not seen her husband, Abdel Aziz Kali, since he was arrested by the Israeli military during the assault. She does not know if he is dead or alive.
According to AFP, the nurse recalled how the Israeli army had quickly surrounded the hospital last month and then used loudspeakers to order that “everyone must surrender. Game over”.
“Then, they started shooting at all the entrances, preventing anyone from moving,” she said. “I spent four days there with my two little daughters, without any food or drink. They cried from hunger. When they arrested my husband, he had not eaten for three days.”
AFP asked the Israeli army if they knew of Kali’s whereabouts, but there was no immediate response.
The Israeli military have long accused Hamas and Palestinian militants of using hospitals and other medical facilities as hideouts and command posts, and their patients as shields. Hamas have denied this.
Motasem Salah, director of the Gaza Emergency Operations Centre, told AFP the scenes on Monday at the sprawling medical centre were “unbearable”.
“The stench of death is everywhere,” he said, as a digger went through the rubble and rescue workers pulled decomposed bodies from the sand and ruins.
Salah said Gaza lacked the forensic experts needed to help identify the dead or determine what had happened to them. So they are relying on “the expertise of the WHO and OCHA (UN humanitarian office) delegation”, he said.
They are trying “to identify the decomposed bodies and the body parts that were crushed” from wallets and documents, Salah told AFP.
Relatives were also there “to ascertain the fate of their sons, whether they have been killed, are missing, or have been displaced to the south,” said Amjad Aliwa, the head of Al-Shifa’s emergency department. He said they wanted to identify “their sons and ensure they receive a proper burial”.
“However, we lack the necessary equipment, and time is not on our side,” Aliwa told AFP. “We must complete the job before the bodies decompose.”
Salah said the psychological impact of this “unwatchable” process on the families is unbearable, in another WHO video from the scene shared with AFP.
“Seeing their children as decomposing corpses and their bodies completely torn apart is a scene that can’t be described. There are no words for it.”
AFP video images from Al-Shifa on Monday showed the remains of several bodies being recovered from one of the courtyards of the hospital and put into body bags.
Several worried relatives walked among what the WHO said were “numerous shallow graves” outside the devastated emergency department and the administrative and surgical buildings.
“Many dead bodies were partially buried with their limbs visible,” it said in a statement after its first visit to the site Friday.
“Safeguarding dignity, even in death, is an indispensable act of humanity,” the WHO insisted.
A “place where life was given is now a place that now reminds [us] only of death,” said Athanasios Gargavanis, the WHO surgeon leading its mission on Monday.

Will the ‘cancel culture’ crowd speak up about the silencing of Asna Tabassum? Don’t hold your breath,2024-04-17,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/17/usc-valedictorian-speech-canceled-palestine,"The University of Southern California canceled its valedictorian’s planned speech after pro-Palestinian posts. It’s no surprise
If you want to get ahead in life then I have some advice: keep your mouth shut about Palestine. Or, if you must say something, then make sure it is nuanced like – I’m just paraphrasing a former Mossad agent here – no Palestinian over the age of four is an innocent civilian and they all deserve to be starved to death. Certainly make sure you don’t use controversial words like “genocide” or “occupation”, even if those are accurate descriptions according to international law and UN human rights experts. Best to avoid considering Palestinians as humans altogether, rather think of them as Israel’s defense minister does – “human animals” – if you want to avoid unpleasantness.
Asna Tabassum, a first-generation south Asian American Muslim from near Los Angeles, is the latest person to learn this lesson the hard way. Tabassum, who is graduating from the University of Southern California (USC) with a major in biomedical engineering and a minor in resistance to genocide, was recently named her class valedictorian and due to give a speech at her May graduation. Giving a valedictorian address, in which a student reflects on shared experiences and imparts wisdom about the future, is a major honour. It would have been a high point in Tabassum’s academic life.
Then on Monday, USC abruptly cancelled her speech. Instead of being recognized for her academic achievements, Tabassum found herself in the middle of a controversy which brings together some of the most emotive issues of the moment: the war on college campuses, the anti-Palestinian assaults on free speech, and the one-sided nature of “cancel culture”.
USC, I should note, didn’t specifically mention Palestine or Israel when they took the unprecedented decision to cancel Tabassum’s speech. Instead Andrew Guzman, provost and senior vice-president for academic affairs, cited safety concerns.
“[O]ver the past several days, discussion relating to the selection of our valedictorian has taken on an alarming tenor,” Guzman explained. “The intensity of feelings … has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement. We cannot ignore the fact that similar risks have led to harassment and even violence at other campuses.”
It’s not clear whether Guzman was talking about Tabassum’s safety or the safety of other students. USC declined my request to clarify their official statement. But here’s a somewhat more straightforward description of what appears to have happened: campus pro-Israel groups trawled through Tabassum’s social media history in order to find posts that were sympathetic to Palestine and then proceeded to smear her with bad-faith accusations of antisemitism. Instead of standing up for a student that USC had recognized as exemplary, the university caved into pressure to silence her. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has called the decision to cancel the speech “cowardly” and the reasoning around safety concerns “disingenuous”.
What exactly did Tabassum say on social media? The issue appears to be a link on her Instagram page – which the student says she posted five years ago – to a slideshow written by someone else urging people “to learn about what’s happening in Palestine”. Part of this document – which, again, is not written by Tabassum –describes Zionism as “a racist settler-colonial ideology that advocates for a Jewish ethnostate built on Palestinian land”. Another part of the presentation argues that the only way towards justice is the abolition of the state of Israel and the creation of one Palestinian state where “both Arabs and Jews can live together without an ideology that specifically advocates for the ethnic cleansing of one of them”.
It’s perfectly valid to debate, and take offence, at the substance of the content Tabassum linked to. But cancelling her speech under the vague pretext of “safety” is disingenuous. Let’s be very clear: if Tabassum were pro-Israel and her Instagram linked to any of the very many genocidal things that the Israeli government had said about Palestinians, there is little chance her speech would have been cancelled. Jared Kushner, let’s not forget, was just at Harvard advocating for the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. (Kushner said that he thought Israel should move civilians out of Gaza into the desert while it “cleans up” the strip. He added that the Palestinians should absolutely not have their own state and mused that waterfront property in Gaza could be very valuable.)
As Tabassum has noted, if this was about her safety, USC could have just hired security guards. Rather, she said in a statement, cancelling her speech seems to be about silencing her voice lest she – who, again, is a student minoring in the resistance to genocide program USC offers – say anything about the continuing genocide in Gaza.
“I am not surprised by those who attempt to propagate hatred,” Tabassum said in the statement. “I am surprised that my own university – my home for four years – has abandoned me.”
I am not surprised. While Palestine has always been a fraught issue, the suppression of pro-Palestinian voices has gone into overdrive after the Hamas attack on 7 October. Speak up about the genocide in Gaza, and you are likely to lose a job, an opportunity, or find yourself smeared as an extremist. In November, the artist Ai Weiwei, who had a show in London cancelled after tweeting about the war in Gaza, wryly noted that censorship in the west was “sometimes even worse” than what he faced growing up in Mao Zedong’s China. “Today I see so many people by giving their basic opinions, they get fired, they get censored,” he told Sky News. “This has become very common.”
People who support the attacks on Gaza seem free to say the most depraved and racist things possible about Arabs, Muslims, and Palestinians without facing any consequences whatsoever. The comedian Sarah Silverman, for example, shared (and later deleted) an online post arguing that it was OK to cut off water to the entire population of Gaza, which is very much a war crime. Her career has faced no consequences. A long list of American politicians have openly called for Palestinians to be slaughtered without seeing any real pushback to their speech. The British TV presenter Rachel Riley recently falsely blamed Palestinians for the stabbing attack in Sydney and has faced no career consequences at all.
The proliferation of dehumanizing language about Muslims and Palestinians has had violent consequences: there has been a rise in anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hate crimes across the US, including reported offenses on college campuses. There has also been a rise in antisemitism: a very real problem that shouldn’t be minimized or tolerated. What also shouldn’t be tolerated are the dangerous attempts by pro-Israel extremists to label any remotely pro-Palestinian speech, or any criticism of Israel’s actions, as automatically antisemitic.
Conflating the actions of the Israeli state with the Jewish people is dangerous and wrong, and yet this is precisely what many pro-Israel voices are doing in an attempt to suppress any support of Palestine. And this strategy is working. In the current climate, a US politician can call for Gaza to be “nuked” without being censured. Dare to do so much as wear a keffiyeh (a traditional Palestinian scarf) on a college campus, however, and pro-Israel voices will go on primetime television and accuse you of being a Nazi. Jonathan Greenblatt, the executive director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), recently told Morning Joe (and faced no pushback from the hosts) that wearing a keffiyeh was the same as wearing a swastika.
Even those who don’t give a damn about Palestinians should care about the suppression of free speech and the attempts to eradicate any mention of the P-word on college campuses. Certainly you’d think conservatives would care: the right are constantly going on about censorship in universities and campus safety. It’s a nonstop talking point on Fox News. Funnily enough, however, these free speech warriors don’t seem particularly concerned about censorship when it comes to Palestine.
What’s left out of these nonstop discussions of campus safety is this: there isn’t a single safe campus left in Gaza. Israel, with the unconditional aid of the US, has destroyed almost every kindergarten, school, and university in Gaza. It has killed at least 100 Palestinian academics. It has decimated every cultural institution. There are over 13,000 dead children in Gaza who will never have the opportunity of an education. You should not be able to talk about campus safety without mentioning the fact that, thanks to US-backed Israeli air strikes, every campus in Gaza is now a graveyard.
